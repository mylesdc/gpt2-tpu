            "text": "The interactions occurring between a virus and a host cell during a viral infection are complex. The purpose of this paper was to analyze altered cellular protein levels in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)-infected swine testicular (ST) cells in order to determine potential virus-host interactions. A proteomic approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification was conducted on the TGEV-infected ST cells. The results showed that the 4-plex iTRAQ-based quantitative approach identified 4,112 proteins, 146 of which showed significant changes in expression 48 h after infection. At 64 h post infection, 219 of these proteins showed significant change, further indicating that a larger number of proteomic changes appear to occur during the later stages of infection. Gene ontology analysis of the altered proteins showed enrichment in multiple biological processes, including cell adhesion, response to stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cell motility, protein complex assembly, growth, developmental maturation, immune system process, extracellular matrix organization, locomotion, cell-cell signaling, neurological system process, and cell junction organization. Changes in the expression levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1), caspase-8, and heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90a) were also verified by western blot analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first time the response profile of ST host cells following TGEV infection has been analyzed using iTRAQ technology, and our description of the late proteomic changes that are occurring after the time of vigorous viral production are novel. Therefore, this study provides a solid foundation for further investigation, and will likely help us to better understand the mechanisms of TGEV infection and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is an animal coronavirus that causes severe gastroenteritis in young TGEV-seronegative pigs. Various breeds of pigs, regardless of age, are susceptible to TGEV; however, the mortality rate for piglets under 2 weeks of age is the highest, reaching almost 100%. Diseased pigs often present with vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea. Further, the disease is known to affect pigs in many countries throughout the world and an outbreak can cause enormous losses in the pig industry [1, 2] . The pathogen, TGEV, which belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronavirinae subfamily within the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus [3, 4] . The envelop, core, and nucleocapsid of the TGEV virion contain four major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, and the spike (S) protein [5] . The tropism and pathogenicity of the virus are influenced by the S protein, which has four major antigenic sites, A, B, C, and D, with site A being the major inducer of antibody neutralization [3, 5] . The M protein, which plays a central role in virus assembly by interacting with viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and S glycoproteins [6] , is embedded within the virus membrane and interacts with the nucleocapsid, forming the core of TGEV virion. In addition, the N-terminal domain of the M protein is essential for interferon alpha (IFN-a) induction [7] , which is involved in the host's innate immune response. The E protein, a transmembrane protein that acts as a minor structural component in TGEV and affects virus morphogenesis, is essential for virion assembly and release [8] .",

These changes in intestinal health are known to be important during the pathogenesis of TGEV infection [9] . Furthermore, corresponding to these pathologic changes observed in vivo, TGEV can also propagate and cause cytopathic effects (CPEs) in multiple types of cultured cells, such as swine testicular (ST) cells, PK-15 cells, and villous enterocytes. Notably, ST cells are more susceptible to TGEV, and higher levels of virus replication have been observed in this cell line [10, 11] .",

            "text": "The full RNA genome of TGEV is approximately 28.5 kb in length and has a 59-cap structure and a poly(A) tail at the 39 end. The 9 open reading frame (ORF) genes included in the TGEV genome are arranged in the following order 59-la-lb-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-39. The first gene at the 59 end consists of two large ORFs, ORF la and ORF lb, which constitute the replicase gene, known for its RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and helicase activities, as well as other enzymes, such as endoribonuclease, 39-59exoribonuclease, 29-O-ribose methyltransferase, ribose ADP 1'' phosphatase, etc. [12] . ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6 encode the S, E, M, and N proteins, respectively, while ORF3a, ORF3b, and ORF7 encode non-structural proteins [13] . Some investigators have suggested that ORF3 may be related to viral virulence and pathogenesis [12] , while ORF7 may interact with host cell proteins and play a role in TGEV replication [14] . In fact, a recent study indicates that plasmid-transcribed small hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting the ORF7 gene of TGEV is capable of inhibiting virus replication and expression of the viral target gene in ST cells in vitro [15] . Although we have some knowledge concerning the translation and function of these viral proteins, the interactions that occur between these proteins and host cell proteins are not fully understood.",

            "text": "Importantly, recent advances in proteomic technology have allowed for more in depth investigation of virus-host interactions, and different techniques have been successfully applied to identify altered proteins in infected host cells and tissues. For example, Sun et al. [16] have identified 35 differentially expressed proteins in PK-15 cells infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-offlight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS). In addition, two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MS/MS proteomic approaches have been applied to characterize protein changes occurring in host cells in response to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection [17] . The same methods have also been studied for many other pathogenic animal viruses, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [18] , coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [19] , severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [20] , and TGEV [21] . However, these conventional approaches based on 2D gel electrophoresis are not suitable for detecting low abundance, hydrophobic, or very acidic/ basic proteins. On the other hand, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, in association with liquid chromatograph (LC), is a more advanced method for proteomic research, and is capable of detecting a much larger number of proteins, even those with low abundance, in addition to identifying and quantifying the proteins simultaneously [22] . To this end, Lu et al. [23] previously used the iTRAQ method to identify 160 significantly altered proteins in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) infected with PRRSV. Similarly, this method has been used to investigate influenza virus infection in primary human macrophages [24] , human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in CD4 + T cells [25] , and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line [26] .",

In this STRING analysis, the interactions (edges) of the submitted proteins (nodes) were scored according to known and predicted protein-protein interactions. We created three protein network maps: one for proteins changed significantly at 48 hpi (30 nodes and 15 edges; Figure 4A ), one for proteins changed significantly at 64 hpi (66 nodes and 70 edges; Figure 4B ), and one for the proteins that were significantly changed when the viral infection was prolonged from 48 to 64 h (24 nodes and 9 edges; Figure 4C) . Notably, the protein network constructed for the 64 hpi time point is clearly much more extensive than the two other networks, and these proteinprotein interactions suggest the existence of reported functional linkages. GO enrichment analysis for the STRING protein network at 64 hpi showed that several biological processes were significantly affected (p,0.05 based on the FDR correction) in this network, including the regulation of viral genome replication, the innate immune response, negative regulation of viral genome replication, positive and negative regulation of viral processes, and ATP biosynthetic processes (Table 3) . However, at 48 hpi, the most enriched biological process was related to cell recognition during phagocytosis(p = 8.02E-1). In Figure 4C , we have shown that the majority proteins in these protein networks, such as radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing protein 2 (RSAD2), Mx dynamin-like GTPase 1 (Mx1), 29-59-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), Mx dynamin-like GTPase 2 (Mx2), are involved in the innate immune response. These data suggest that some entirely different host proteins, interactions, or processes, including the immune response, were perturbed at these times during TGEV infection. edges. Network analysis was set at medium confidence (STRING score = 0.4). Seven different colored lines were used to represent the types of evidence for the association: green, neighborhood evidence; red, gene fusion; blue, co-occurrence; black, co-expression; purple, experimental; light blue, database; yellow, text mining. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110647.g004",

HSP90a, caspase 8, and TGF-b1 all filled these criteria and their protein expression was analyzed via western blot analysis of the cell lysate. As shown in Figure 5 , the expression of HSP90a was significantly downregulated in TGEVinfected cells at 64 hpi, while the expression of caspase-8 was upregulated from 48 to 64 hpi in these cells. The expression of TGF-b1 was also significantly induced in TGEV-infected cells following infection.

ST cells are known to be sensitive to TGEV, resulting in increased viral multiplication and CPEs [15] . In order to better understand the interactions between the host proteome and TGEV, we adopted an iTRAQ quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the altered cellular proteins of the ST cells during TGEV infection in vitro. Compared with the 2-DE and 2D-DIGE methods often used, the 2D-LC-MS/MS method utilized here provides more quantitative and qualitative information about the proteins, and can also detect membrane proteins, hydrophobic proteins, higher molecular weight proteins, and low-abundance proteins, which are often missed by other methods. iTRAQ also has more advantages compared to isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) methods, which both allow multiple labeling and quantitation of four to eight samples simultaneously with high sensitivity [22, 33, 34] . Further, the iTRAQ technique has been widely used for quantitative proteomics, including protein expression analysis and biomarker identification [23] [24] [25] [26] 35] .",

The results indicated that TGEV induced significant CPEs from 40 to 64 hpi in infected cells compared to the mock infected cells. At 40 hpi, less than 50% of the infected cells were morphologically altered, while at 48 hpi more than 80% infected cells showed rounding and granular degeneration. Further, the mRNA level of the viral N gene in ST cells continuously increased in the infected cells until 48 h, at which time we observed the highest viral replication level. At 64 hpi, the morphological effects observed were much more pronounced, characterized by even more cellular rounding and detachment. However, the mRNA levels of the viral N gene decreased rapidly from 48 to 64 h, a phenomenon we believe may be attributed to the host's immune response or a decrease in infected cell viability as the TGEV infection progressed. Based on our qRT-PCR and CPE analyses, we choose to more deeply investigate the proteomic changes occurring in the TGEV-infected ST cells at 48 hpi and 64 hpi using a 4-plex iTRAQ analysis.",

This number includes protein changes that were unique for a specific time point as well as those shared at these different time conditions. For example, the expression level of HSP90a expression was unchanged at 48 hpi, but decreased at 64 hpi, Note: The significance of the GO biological process is derived from the network in Figure 4B and was determined using the FDR correction (p,0.05). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110647.t003 making this change unique for the latter time point. On the other hand, TGF-b1 was observed to increase at both of the time points, and was thus labeled a shared protein change. Moreover, the 316 altered proteins also includes proteins that changed from 48 hpi to 64 hpi, rather than one of these time points compared to noninfected cells. For example, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and MHC class I antigen (PD1) were not changed at 48 or 64 hpi compared to the control group, but increased at 64 hpi compared with 48 hpi. We also observed a larger proteomic shift at 64 hpi compared to the 48 hpi time point in the infected ST cells. Further, some proteins previously reported to play a role in virus-induced host cell death, such as caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-9, and porcine aminopeptidase-N (pAPN) [36] [37] [38] , were also identified using this iTRAQ technique. These caspase proteins are known to be involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis processes, while pAPN is the cell receptor for TGEV. Our results indicate that TGEV infection caused significant upregulation of caspase-8 expression at two time points (approximately 7-fold at 48 hpi and 16-fold at 64 hpi) in the virus-infected ST cells, and this change was verified by western blotting analysis. However, the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, and pAPN was not significantly altered, indicating that the pathways involving these genes are not altered or that other proteins are compensating for their lack of change. In this regard, we identified an additional 15 proteins involved in cell death pathways that had significantly altered expression levels (p = 4.46E-2) (Table S6) , including melanoma differentiation associated protein-5 (MDA5), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2), thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (PRDX3), peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), predicted protein CYR61 (CYR61), keratin, type II cytoskeletal 8 (KRT8), predicted bcl-2-like protein 13 (BCL2L13), predicted integrin alpha-5 isoform 1 (ITGA5), TGF-b1, amyloid beta A4 protein (APP), clusterin (CLU), C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5), heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B), alpha-crystallin B chain (CRYAB), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1), all of which, with the exception of PRDX2 and BCL2L13 were upregulated at one or two time points. Regulation of cell death is known to be important for replication and pathogenesis in various coronaviruses [39] , and we believe that further research on these proteins will lead to a better understanding of cell death regulation during TGEV infection.",

This analysis indicated that six biological processes were significantly affected at 48 and 64 hpi, and the differentially expressed proteins involved in these processes were almost the same. The large overlap between the two time points suggests that some of the same sets of host proteins or processes were disturbed at these times. However, it is also likely that some processes were affected solely at one time point or the other. At 48 hpi, serine/threonineprotein phosphatase PP1-beta-catalytic subunit (PPP1CB), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1), transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI), and predicted inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) were uniquely altered, likely indicating changes in cell adhesion and/or cell-cell signaling processes. At 64 hpi, on the other hand, calreticulin (CALR), predicted tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2-like (TACSTD2), vascular cell adhesion molecule, galectin-3 (LGALS3), glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), and C-X-C motif chemokine 16 (CXCL16) were uniquely changed, also indicating changes in cell adhesion and/or cell-cell signaling as well as extracellular matrix organization and locomotion.

            "text": "The most significantly enriched GO category related to the differentially expressed proteins was stress, which included 12 differentially expressed proteins at 48 hpi and 27 different proteins at 64 hpi. The increased number of proteins association with this GO term at 48 hpi likely highlights the initial upregulation of the cellular stress response, while the higher number at 64 hpi indicates that the stress response to TGEV infection is likely more fully induced at this later stage. HSPs, also known as stress proteins, are often involved in the cellular response to stress, influencing changes in the state or activity of the cell or organism. HSP90, which has two isoforms (HSP90a and HSP90b), is one of the most abundant molecular chaperones that is induced in response to cellular stress, and it functions to stabilize proteins involved in cell growth and anti-apoptotic signaling [40] . The expression of HSP90a has been reported to play an important role in the replication of some viruses, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) [41] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [42] , influenza virus [43] , and Japanese encephalitis virus [44] . On the other hand, the reduction of HSP90b has been reported to decrease the correct assembly of human enterovirus 71 viral particles [40] . In this study, HSP90a and heat shock 90kD protein 1, beta (HSPCB/HSP90b) were significantly downregulated at 64 hpi in the TGEV-infected ST cells, but were unchanged at 48 hpi, indicating that they may play a similar role in TGEV infection. Interestingly, a member of the HSP70 protein family, heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B), as well as mitochondrial 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) were both upregulated in infected ST cells at 48 and/or 64 hpi. HSP60 is a mitochondrial chaperonin protein involved in protein folding and a number of extracellular immunomodulatory activities. Elevated expression of HSP60 is associated with a number of inflammatory disorders [45] . HSP70 plays an important role in multiple processes within cells, including protein translation, folding, intracellular trafficking, and degradation. A previous study has revealed that HSP70 is involved in all steps of the viral life cycle, including replication, and is highly specific in regards to viral response, differing from one cell to another for any given virus type [46] . For example, silencing HSP70 expression has been associated with an increase in viral protein levels, while an increase in HSP70 has been suspected to be the initial cellular response to protect against viral infection in rotavirus-infected cells [47] . Further, a recent study showed that HSP70 is an essential host factor for the replication of PRRSV as the silence of HSP70 significantly reduced PRRSV replication [48] . Our results provide new experimental evidence relating the expression of HSP90, HSP70, and HSP60 to TGEV infection, and we speculate that these proteins play a potential role in TGEV replication. Additional work is required to investigate the detailed role of these proteins during TGEV infection.",

            "text": "Furthermore, another significantly enriched GO process we observed that 11 significantly altered proteins was immune system processes. Most of these proteins were significantly upregulated at 64 hpi in response to the viral infection, while some were first upregulated at 48 hpi, including CCL5 and TGF-b1. Chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL16, whose main function is macrophage recruitment and activation, are potentially involved in host-mediated immunopathology. A recent study showed that coronavirus infection of transgenic mice expressing CCL2 led to a dysregulated immune response without effective virus clearance and enhanced death [49] . In additional, TGEV-infection can induce the expression of proinflammatory genes, including CCL2, CCL5, and probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX58 (DDX58/RIG-1), in cell culture and in vivo in the absence of viral protein 7 [50] . In this study, we observed an upregulation of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, TGF-b1, and DDX58 expression. TGF-b1 is a multifunctional cytokine, secreted from various cells, and, in immunology, it regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, and other cellular functions for a variety of cell types, especially regulatory T cells [51] . Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) increases TGF-b1 mRNA expression and protein production in human promonocytes [52] . Further, Gomez-Laguna et al. [53] inferred that the upregulation of the TGF-b may impair the host immune response during PRRSV infection by limiting the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines necessary to decrease PRRSV replication. In response to viral infection, DDX58 plays important roles in the recognition of RNA viruses in various cells, and has been identified as a candidate for a cytoplasmic viral dsRNA receptor [54] . Further, upregulation of this gene activates cells to produce type I interferons, which may increase the antiviral status of cells to protect against viral infection. In this regard, we found that interferon-inducible antiviral proteins, RSAD2, OAS1, were also upregulated in the period of late infection, suggesting that many of the proteins identified in this study are associated with inflammation, IFN activation, and the innate immune response. Increased expression of these proteins may help the virus enter the cell as well as potentially enhance TGEV replication or the host response against the virus, during the late stages of infection.",

A larger number of protein expression changes occurred at 64 hpi compared to 48 hpi, indicating a larger shift in the proteome in the later stages of infection. GO analysis of these differentially expressed proteins indicated that a number of diverse biological processes are affected. In addition, many of the significant immune response related changes in protein expression we discovered are novel and, to our knowledge, have not been detected in previous proteome study. Results from this study complement the previous proteomics data obtained concerning the host response to a viral infection, and further facilitates a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of TGEV infection and molecular responses of host cells to this virus.
