However, overproduction of cytokines could trigger a dangerous situation known as a cytokine storm. The nonstructural protein of SFTSV has been described to inhibit type I interferon (IFN-I) production in cell culture [8, 9] . Mouse is naturally resistant to SFTSV infection, but IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) deficient mouse is highly susceptible to SFTSV infection [10] . These studies suggested that IFN-I may play an important role in resistance SFTSV infection. However, the role of IFN-I in resistance SFTSV infections has not yet been investigated in humans although the role of other cytokines has been well studied by several reports. The aim of this study is to determine the concentration of IFN-\u03b1, a subtype of IFN-I as well as the concentration of other cytokines in SFTS patients and in the healthy population. By analyzing the differences in cytokine concentrations between severe SFTS patents and mild SFTS patients and between SFTS patients and the healthy population, we attempted to determine the role of IFN-\u03b1 and other cytokines in the pathogenesis of SFTS.",

            "text": "Interferons are glycoprotein secreted by mononuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in response to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, or tumor cells [14] . Based on the type of receptor, human interferons have been classified into three major types: interferon type I, interferon type II and interferon type III. In a typical scenario, a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-virus defenses. IFN-\u03b1 proteins produced by leukocytes [15] is a member of the type I interferon family, a multi-gene cytokine family that includes IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03c4, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b4 and IFN-\u03b6 in humans [16] . All IFN-I bind to a cell surface receptor complex, IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR), consisting of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains [17, 18] . IFN-I has been found in all mammals and similar molecules have been found in fish, reptile and birds [17, 18] . IFN-I has diverse effects on innate and adaptive immune cells during infections, directly and/or indirectly through the induction of other mediators [19] . Normal mice are resistant to SFTSV infection, but IFNAR deficient mice became highly susceptible to SFTSV infection, suggesting the importance of IFN-I in resistance to SFTSV infection [10] . However, IFN-I has been shown to cause immunopathology in some acute viral infections, such as influenza virus infection [19] . The changes of IFN-I content during different viral infections varied. The level of IFN-\u03b1 was significantly elevated in the serum of SARS and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome patients [20, 21] . However, another study indicated that the IFN-I response was not notable during hantavirus infection [22] . Given the importance of IFN-I against viral infections or in immunopathology of viral infections, it is surprising that only one article reported the IFN-\u03b12 concentration in the serum of SFTS patients [2] . Our original hypothesis was that IFN-I should be low in severe SFTS patients than in mild SFTS patients because it had the function in defending against viral infection. However, our results showed the opposite, suggesting that high concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 in SFTS patient could not control SFTSV, which may actually involve in cytokine storm. It is interesting to note that in vitro studies indicated that the non-structural proteins of SFTSV inhibits the generation of type I interferon to promote viral replication [8, 9, 23] . However, our results indicated that the level of IFN-\u03b1 is significantly higher in SFTS patients than healthy persons. Moreover, IFN-\u03b1 is also significant higher in severe SFTS patients than in mild SFTS patients. A previous study also indicated that severe SFTS patients had higher SFTSV viral loads in serum than mild SFTS patients [24] . Combining the results of our study and the previous study, we concluded that higher SFTSV viral load stimulate stronger IFN-\u03b1 production in vivo, suggesting that non-structural proteins of SFTSV may be not important for inhibition of the production of type I INFs in vivo.",

RANTES have an essential role in activation and proliferation of antigen-specific T cells [39] . It was the only indicator we studied that had a higher level in healthy subjects. Furthermore, its concentration was decreased in severe patients compared to the mild patients. This result was completely opposite with other cytokines. In a previous study, the level of RANTES decreased in SFTS patient which was consistent with our result [5] . However, in another study the concentration of RANTES in patients' sera was obviously increased compared to healthy persons [6] . The concentration discrepancy of RANTES in different studies may be caused by collecting the samples in different stage of infection.",

Studies found that a variety of pathogen infections can cause a cytokine storm, which may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure [5, [41] [42] [43] . Previous studies demonstrated that SFTSV infection induced a cytokine storm with abnormally expressed cytokine profiles, which might be associated with the disease severity [5, 6, 44] . Consistent with our study, the elevated cytokines in those above studies included IP-10, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1. However, the differences of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 concentration between severe and mild SFTS patients were varied in different studies. Deng, et al showed that the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in severe cases than non-severe cases [6] . However, there were people who also indicated that the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 during the acute phase were only slightly elevated in severe cases [5] . In this study, most of the cytokines including G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-6, and IP-10 were correlated to the severity of SFTSV infection.",
