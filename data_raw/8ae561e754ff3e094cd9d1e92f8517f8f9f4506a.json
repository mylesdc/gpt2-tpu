In vitro studies have shown that D21 IFITM3 loses its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV. Subsequent research has also revealed that tyrosine 20 is the key determinant for IFITM3 endocytic trafficking, which is essential for the efficient anti-viral activity of IFITM3. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that both D21 IFITM3 and an IFITM3 variant (Y20A IFITM3), in which tyrosine 20 is substituted with alanine, strongly restricted entry mediated by IAV H1, H3, H5, and H7 proteins. D21 IFITM3 also efficiently suppressed replication of H1N1 and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 IAV. D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than full-length IFITM3 but an abundant amount of both IFITM3 variants still localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data indicate that tyrosine 20 partially regulates the subcellular localization of IFITM3 but is not functionally essential for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction. They also suggested that mechanisms, other than viral entry restriction, might contribute to variations in clinical outcomes of H1N1 influenza associated with rs12252-C.",

Among them, IFITM3 plays a central role in limiting influenza A virus (IAV) entry and replication in vitro and in vivo [6, 7] . Recent studies have shown that IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252-C, which encodes an aberrant form of IFITM3 lacking the amino-terminal (N-terminal) 21 amino acids (D21 IFITM3), contributes to poor clinical outcomes in patients with H1N1 IAV infections [7, 8] . However, the association between rs12252-C polymorphism and the severity of H1N1 influenza could not be established in research analyzing more than 5000 subjects in two separate cohorts [9] . The rs12252-C polymorphism has also been reported to be a prognostic factor for H7N9 avian influenza. rs12252-C carriers developed more severe symptoms and signs, had higher viral and cytokine titers, and experienced higher mortality [10] . Although the prevalence of IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252-C is extremely low among Caucasians, the 1000 Genomes Project has revealed a high prevalence of rs12252-C in East Asian populations-most substantially in the Japanese population, with an allele frequency of 43.82% being homozygous carriers, and, to a lesser extent, in the Han Chinese population, with a homozygous allele frequency of 25.38% [7, 8] .",

Everitt et al. observed that D21 IFITM3 lost its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV replication in vitro. However, they could not detect expression of D21 IFITM3 in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) homozygous for rs12252-C at the protein level [7] . In addition to IAV, subsequent studies showed that D21 IFITM3 was incapable of inhibiting vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and that tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 was critical for IFITM3 subcellular localization and its anti-viral function [11] [12] [13] [14] . Replacing tyrosine with alanine (Y20A IFITM3) shifted late endosome/lysosome-associated IFITM3 to the plasma membrane and severely diminished its effect on viral restriction. Tyrosine 20 was also reported to be a major determinant for regulating IFITM3 ubiqitination and endocytic trafficking [13, 14] . Tyrosine 20-mediated interaction with adaptor protein 2 (AP2) contributed to IFITM3 endocytosis, which was thought to be essential for IFITM3-mediated restriction [14] . Although tyrosine 20 is a substrate of tyrosine-protein kinase FYN, depleting the expression of FYN did not impair the function of IFITM3 [13] .",

D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 strongly inhibited entry mediated by IAV H1, H5, and H7 (Shan; from A/Shanghai/02/2013 [H7N9]), and, to a lesser extent, by H3 and H7 (FPV; from A/FPV/Rostock/34 [H7N1]) proteins. In parallel, H1N1 IAV replication was suppressed as efficiently by D21 IFITM3 as full-length (FL) IFITM3, whereas an attenuated effect of D21 IFITM3 on H3N2 IAV replication could be detected. Different from FL IFITM3, which concentrated in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, both D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 distributed at the plasma and late endosomal/ lysosomal membranes. Epitope-tagged IFITM3 isoforms, which have been commonly used in IFITM-related research, had inconsistent inhibitory effects on IAV entry and replication. They also had different subcellular distributions from those of native IFITM3 isoforms. Our data indicate that 21 amino acids at the Nterminus of IFITM3 are not critical and that tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 is not a major determinant of IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction. They also suggest that poor clinical prognosis in rs12252-C carriers may not be caused by defective anti-viral activity of D21 IFITM3. Finally, because epitope tags alter properties of IFITM3, native IFITM3 isoforms would be better models for IFITM studies.",

The weaker signal for D21 IFITM3 detected by the anti-IFITM2/3 antibody, which interacts with the N-terminal 3-57 amino acids on IFITM3, might be due to its lower affinity for D21 IFITM3. By contrast, an anti-IFITM1/2/3 antibody, which recognizes the center region of IFITM proteins, and was used in previous research [7] , interacted well with D21 IFITM3 but poorly with FL IFITM3 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A) .

Tyrosine 20mediated posttranslational modifications might contribute to the weaker signal of FL IFITM3 detected by the anti-IFITM1/2/3 antibody.)

In our studies, we used A549 cells transduced with tet-inducible plasmids encoding native FL IFITM3 or D21 IFITM3, or with vector alone. MLV-GFP pseudotyped with H7 protein from influenza A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) virus, which caused an outbreak in China in 2013 [19, 20] , was also included. Because the anti-IFITM2/3 antibody used in our studies had different affinities against FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3, we titrated their expression using different concentrations of doxycycline to examine their effects on IAV entry at comparable expression levels. As shown in Fig. 2A and Figs. S1B and C, in the presence of a low concentration of doxycycline, both native FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 strongly restricted IAV H1-, H5-, and H7(Shan)-mediated entry. The inhibitory effect of D21 IFITM3 on entry of H3 and H7(FPV) pseudoviruses was weaker but still significant. In contrast to IAV, entry mediated by VSV G protein was moderately suppressed by FL IFITM3 and marginally affected by D21 IFITM3; these results are in agreement with previous observations [11] . Similar phenomena could also be observed in our viral replication assays. Replication of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Virginia/ATCC3/2009 (H1N1) viruses was suppressed efficiently by both IFITM3 isoforms, whereas influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2) virus replicated more efficiently in D21 IFITM3-expressing than in FL IFITM3-expressing cells (Figs. 2B and C).",

As predicted, with comparable expression levels between IFN-induced and tet-induced IFITM3 (Fig. 2D) , stronger suppression of viral entry and replication was observed in cells treated with IFN. This enhanced restriction effect could be attributed to expression of additional IFN-inducible effectors. Owing to the lack of an epitope tag and commercially available antibodies equally recognizing IFITM3 isoforms, expression of D21 IFITM3 was assayed using anti-IFITM2/3 antibody as described previously. Although weak signals for D21 IFITM3 could be detected, its expression should have been substantial and comparable to that of FL IFITM3. In addition, the expression levels of both IFITM3 isoforms were similar to that of IFITM3 induced by IFN. Previous studies have revealed the inability of D21 IFITM3 to restrict H1N1 IAV infections and the functional importance of the Nterminal 21 amino acids in IFITM-mediated restriction [7, 11, 12] . By contrast, our data demonstrated that both IFITM3 isoforms were functionally competent to restrict entry mediated by IAV H1, H5, and H7(Shan) proteins and to suppress replication of H1N1 IAV. The inhibitory effect of D21 IFITM3 on H3 and H7(FPV) infection was weaker than that of FL IFITM3 but still very prominent.",

According to our studies, D21 IFITM3 suppressed IAV entry and replication, indicating that tyrosine 20 may not be a major determinant for IFITMmediated restriction. To examine this possibility, we generated an IFITM3 variant by replacing tyrosine with alanine (Y20A IFITM3). As shown in Figs. 3A and B, when we transiently hyperexpressed FL IFITM3, D21 IFITM3, and Y20A IFITM3 in A549 cells, entry of IAV was suppressed efficiently by each of the three IFITM3 variants. By contrast, D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 slightly inhibited VSV infection, whereas MLV entry was not affected. In addition to A549 cells, entry restriction of IAV could similarly be observed in FL IFITM3-, D21 IFITM3-, or Y20A IFITM3-expressing 239T and Vero E6 cells (Figs. 3C to F) . Because of their extremely low infectivity in Vero E6 cells, the effects of IFITM3 variants on IAV H1-and H3-mediated entry into Vero E6 cells were not evaluated. In summary, our data demonstrated that both D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 restricted IAV entry, suggesting that tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 is functionally dispensable for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction.",

Jia et al. showed that-compared with flag-tagged FL IFITM3, which distributes mainly in late endosomes/lysosomes-flag-tagged D21 IFITM3 localizes primarily to the periphery of the cell [11] . To examine whether native IFITM3 isoforms have similar subcellular distributions, confocal analysis was performed. We observed that native D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than FL IFITM3. Nevertheless, a large amount of D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 still colocalized with LAMP2, a late-endosomal/lysosomal marker (Fig. 4) . When epitope tags were added to the N-terminus of IFITM3 isoforms, their subcellular distribution was changed. Both c-myc-tagged IFITM3 isoforms concentrated in late-endosomal/lysosomal compartments (Fig. 5A) , whereas a minimal amount of flag-tagged FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 colocalized with LAMP2 (Fig. 5B) . These diverse patterns of subcellular distributions were compatible with our viral entry data. Flag-tagged D21 IFITM3, which mainly distributed to the plasma membrane, had the weakest effect on viral entry. However, endosome/lysosome-associated native D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 might contribute to efficient inhibition of IAV infection. The broader distributions of D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 (compared with FL IFITM3) at both the plasma and endosomal/lysosomal membranes raises the possibility that the N-terminal 21 amino acids and tyrosine 20 play important roles but may not be the only determinants contributing to the subcellular localization of IFITM3. Because epitope tags altered the subcellular distribution and interfered with the function of IFITM3, native IFITM3 isoforms would be a better model for IFITM3-related studies.",

Although the attenuated effect of D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 on H3 and H7(FPV) infections could be observed, this inhibition was still significant and even more prominent than the effect of FL IFITM3 on VSV entry. Because several endocytic pathways contribute to IAV cellular entry [21] [22] [23] , we could not exclude the possibility that various strains of IAVs may have minor differences in their endocytic trafficking.

However, our data suggest that 21 amino acids at the N-terminus of IFITM3 are not essential for H1N1 IAV restriction. There are two possible reasons to explain these discrepancies. First, native or epitope-tagged IFITM3 isoforms were used in different studies [11] [12] [13] . As shown in our research, epitope tags interfered with the function and the subcellular distribution of IFITM3 isoforms, indicating that native IFITM3 may be a better system for IFITM3-realted studies. Second, expression of FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 was not well controlled in previous research [7] . Everitt et al. used an anti-IFITM1/2/3 antibody, which interacts poorly with FL IFITM3 based on our observations, to recognize both IFITM3 isoforms [7] . The signals of FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 detected by western blotting were comparable in this research suggesting that the actual expression level of FL IFITM3 should be multiple folds higher than that of D21 IFITM3. In our studies, we used various antibodies, native and epitope-tagged IFITM3 isoforms, as well as the tet-inducible system to evaluate the effects of FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 on IAV entry at comparable protein expression levels. To assay the anti-viral activities of IFITM3 isoforms with appropriate expression, we further included IFN-treated cells as our controls. Metabolism of IFITM3 isoforms may be another variant contributing to different anti-viral activities of IFITM3 isoforms. However, we observed that FL IFITM3 and D21 IFITM3 have similar turnover rates (data not shown).",

In our studies, we did observe that D21 IFITM3 had an attenuated but significant effect on restricting replication of H3N2 IAV.
