However, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni 2+ -NTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni 2+ -NTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. The recombinantly expressed Scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. It also produced 100% reduction in Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. Thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant Scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.

Its N-terminal amino acid sequence is similar to cecropins, whereas its C-terminal region has several disulfide bridges, similar to the structure of defensins [7] .

In addition, no infected erythrocytes were detected after 72 h, at all tested concentrations.

SUMO has 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin [29] . The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only a single SUMO gene (SMT3) that is essential for viability [30] . In contrast to yeast SMT3, three members of SUMO have been described in vertebrates: SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. Human SUMO-1, a 101 amino acid polypeptide, shares 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2/ SUMO-3 [31] , which are close homologues. It is known that SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with other proteins, can fold and protect the protein by its chaperoning properties, making it a useful tag for heterologous expression [12, 32] . All SUMO genes encode precursor proteins with a short C-terminal sequence that extends from the conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly motif. SUMO proteases remove SUMO from proteins, by cleaving the C-termini of SUMO (-GGATY) in yeast to the mature form (-GG) or deconjugating it from lysine side chains [33, 34] . The former activity (protease) is useful for removal of SUMO as an expression tag. In this study, we expressed scorpine as SUMO fusions in E. coli to evaluate its anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities. The SUMO fusion protein was successfully expressed in E. coli. The SUMO/scorpine fusion protein could be completely cleaved using SUMO protease, as shown in Fig. 2C . The Scorpine, which is about 8 kDa, was recovered with 95% purity using nickel affinity chromatography again.",

To further confirm the potential clinical values of Scorpine, we investigated effects of recombinant Scorpine on biofilm formation ability of bacteria, using the CV method [22] . As shown in Fig. 4 , the recombinant Scorpine was able to inhibit the biofilm formation of bacteria. The biofilm formation as a bacterial survival strategy leads to increased resistance to heat, acid, preservatives, and antibiotics [35, 36] . Bacterial infections can mainly occur after consumption of contaminated foods. The ingested bacteria are exposed to acidic stress and bile salt under oxygen-limited conditions during transit through the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon. These stress conditions can influence antibiotic resistance patterns, biofilm-forming abilities, and virulence properties [37] . Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria can possibly reside in biofilms and lead to enhanced tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, causing serious infectious diseases [38] [39] [40] . Our data showed that the recombinant Scorpine was able to inhibit not only the growth of bacteria but aslo the biofilm formation of bacteria, suggest that the potential clinical use of Scorpine in the future.",
