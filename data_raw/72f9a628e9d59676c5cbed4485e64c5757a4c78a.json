These dated sequences were analyzed with influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere, worldwide. In addition, the NA sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring, known, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance-associated amino acid mutations (R292K and E119V). Before 2001, the Hong Kong HA and NA sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99) than did sequences from elsewhere. After 2001, this trend reversed with significant clusters containing HA and NA sequences from different locations, isolated at different times, suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza A(H3N2) seasonality during this 10-year period. However, at least one example from Hong Kong was found suggesting that in some years, influenza A(H3N2) viruses may persist in the same location, perhaps continuing to circulate, sub-clinically, at low levels between seasons, to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year, relatively unchanged. None of these Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) NA sequences contained any of the known NAI-resistance associated mutations.",

Naturally occurring NAI resistance mutations were absent or, at least, very rare in this population.",

[2] postulated a rapid, global dispersion of 'airborne aerosolized influenza virus' via the atmosphere, to account for the persistence and spread of the disease. Recent reviews have discussed the various approaches to resolving this question, and identified various factors that may be involved, including: properties of the virus itself (mutation rates and immune escape), properties of the host (seasonal variation in host health and behavior, e.g. crowding and air travel, production and dissemination of bioaerosols through sneezing and coughing), and properties of the environment (temperature, humidity and weather variations, e.g. El Nino) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

In contrast, other Northern hemisphere countries usually have a more extended influenza season from November to March/April, whereas the influenza season of Southern hemisphere countries usually occur from May to September [7, 28] . Hence, Hong Kong may be unique in that its biphasic influenza seasonality seems to straddle those of the Northern and Southern hemisphere countries, making the molecular epidemiology of its circulating influenza viruses of great interest. In addition, Hong Kong and Southern China have been referred to as the 'epicenter' for new influenza A viruses with pandemic potential for over 25 years now [29] .

As these authors stated, ideally, whole genomes should be used for more accurate phylogenetic analyses of influenza virus as has been reported previously [14, 15] , with at least one good reason for this being the potentially misleading conclusions caused by influenza viral HA and NA gene reassortments [19] .

The reason for this is that, especially in Hong Kong, unlike adults, children of school age (1-10 years old) are more likely to stay close to home and not travel far from home, which would minimize any importation of influenza viruses from overseas.

Since the same viruses show this same pattern of clustering in both their HA and NA genes, this reduces the likelihood that this was due to a reassortment event in one of these genes, i.e. it is less likely for the same viruses to have reassorted both the HA and NA genes during the same years -though of course this possibility cannot be ruled out. Whole genome sequencing would be useful to confirm this if resources are available in the future. ii) from Figures S3 and S4 , it is difficult to say whether viruses from Hong Kong preceded (or gave rise to) those from elsewhere, since viruses from outside Hong Kong can be found to both pre-date and post-date those isolated from Hong Kong. However, there are several examples of similar viruses being isolated in different parts of the world at about the same time (as shown in some of the red ellipses in Figures S3 and S4 Figures S3 and S4) , though this may not necessarily mean that the Fuj/411/02-like viruses originated from there.",

Such a reduction in protective efficacy from the contemporary WHO influenza vaccine has indeed been suggested in several reports [14, 30, 31] . Similarly, although, the NA antigen is not usually specified in seasonal influenza vaccine, and its protective effect is unknown, its sequence variation in NA during this transitional period, may have also contributed to the reduced protection provided by the seasonal influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component during this period, when the Fuj/411/02-like viruses were emerging.",

However, there may be small localities of so-called 'latency' where viruses remain circulating at low levels within that local population, to reemerge during the influenza season of the following year, with relatively little genetic change. This may affect only a minority of these populations, with the majority being infected by newly imported influenza viruses from elsewhere. These concepts are summarized in Figure 1 .",

However, they did not have access to large numbers of influenza sequences from Southeast Asia. Thus, in view of the new data presented in this study, it is hoped that such hypotheses may be revised, to include a contribution from the latency mechanism. In some populations (perhaps those more localized in Southeast Asia), this latency mechanism may contribute more significantly to the underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza A -a possibility not entirely ruled out by one of these studies [38] . More data is required to explore this hypothesis in those populations. Admittedly, the fact that in this 10-year (1997-2006 ) data set of almost 300 influenza A(H3N2) HA and NA sequences from Hong Kong, we have only found one particular example supporting the latency mechanism, does suggest that this is a relative rarity, and that the migration mechanism is probably responsible for the majority of influenza seasonality patterns seen worldwide.",

Influenza A(H3N2) seasonality may mainly result from 'migration' (thicker straight arrows) where different influenza A(H3N2) viruses move around the world between different populations at different times of the year. However, some influenza A(H3N2) viruses may remain and persist within the same population and location (thinner spiral arrows), circulating at low (perhaps subclinical) levels between influenza seasons ('latency'), to re-emerge the following season with relatively little genetic change.

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 285 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences (1538 bp), consisting of 281 from Hong Kong (collected during 1997-2006) and 4 WHO vaccine HA sequences (from Syd/ 5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04, all yellow highlighted in red boxes), aligned and edited in BioEdit, constructed using PAUP* under an optimum model of evolution (a general reversible time model with a proportion of invariable sites I, and a gamma distributed rate of substitution G, i.e. GTR+I+G), as selected by MODELTEST under the Akaike Information Criteria and displayed using FigTree. The red boxes highlight sequences from January samples, where available, between 1997 and 2006. In particular, sequences 5250Jan02, 5251Jan02 and 5627Jan03 occur on the same branch, demonstrating the persistence of this virus between influenza seasons 2002 and 2003 in Hong Kong.

No Hong Kong NA sequences cluster with the Fuj/411/02 and Cal/7/04 WHO vaccine HA sequences.

After 2001, HA and NA sequences from non-Hong Kong viruses cluster more closely with the Fuj/411/02 and Cal/7/04 WHO vaccine sequences, which may be just a reflection of the poor vaccine strain match during the emergence of the Fuj/411/02-like viruses during 2002-2004, with Hong Kong being one of the last regions to be invaded by this strain. Most of the HA and NA sequences clustering closely with the Fuji/411/02 and Cal/7/04 WHO vaccine strains seem to have been isolated in Australasia (",
