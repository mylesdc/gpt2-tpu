            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), also known as porcine coronavirus HKU15, was first detected in North America in early 2014 and associated with enteric disease in pigs, resulting in an urgent need to further investigate the ecology of this virus. While assays detecting nucleic acids were implemented quickly, assays to detect anti-PDCoV antibodies have not been available. In this study, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the putative S1 portion of the spike protein was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG in U.S. pigs. The diagnostic sensitivity of the PDCoV ELISA was 91% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%. A total of 968 serum samples were tested including samples with confirmed infection with PDCoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus. There was no cross-reactivity with any of the other coronaviruses. Among 355 arbitrarily selected serum samples collected in 2014 and originating from 51 farms across 18 U.S. states, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in 8.7% of the samples and in 25.5% of the farms whereas anti-PEDV IgG was detected in 22.8% of the samples and in 54.9% of the farms. In addition, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in archived samples collected in 2010, perhaps indicating an earlier undetected introduction into the U.S. pig population. Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV seroprevalence in U.S. pigs is lower compared to PEDV and PDCoV may have been introduced to the U.S. prior to PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in a rectal swab collected in 2009 from a pig in Hong Kong, China, and is related to avian and Asian leopard deltacoronaviruses identified in apparently healthy wild animals [1] [2] [3] . Recently, PDCoV has been described in association with diarrhea in pigs across all production stages in North America [4] [5] [6] . Specifically, in February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture issued a press release indicating that PDCoV was detected in swine feces from five separate pig farms in Ohio, with clinical signs of watery diarrhea in sows and enteric disease associated with increased mortality in piglets [4] . The presence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was ruled out but a portion of the samples were also positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [4] . In response to the impact of the newly emerging porcine coronaviruses PEDV [7, 8] and PDCoV [4] in the U.S. pig population, the USDA issued a federal order requiring reporting of all novel cases associated with all porcine enteric coronaviruses effective June 5, 2014 [9] . In contrast to PEDV [10] [11] [12] , the epidemiology, viral pathogenesis and clinical symptoms associated with PDCoV infection are still largely unknown. Nevertheless, preliminary results obtained after experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with this virus indicate severe clinical signs (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration) and microscopic lesions consistent with coronavirus infection in the small intestines [13] . However, serological assays to undertake field based epidemiological studies are not available to date. Sequencing of the complete genome of U.S. PDCoV strains from different states indicates a nucleotide identity of approximately 99% when compared to the PDCoV sequence initially reported in China [6, 14, 15] .",

Furthermore, in silico prediction of the PDCoV epitopes was performed and results were compared with the alphacoronavirus PEDV, TGEV and PRCV. As expected, the S1 protein contained the majority of the mapped epitopes within the coronavirus proteins known to elicit humoral response (E, M, N and S). In addition, a comparison of the amino acid identity between the expressed PDCoV S1 antigen for the developed ELISA and the other 19 PDCoV sequences in the Gen-Bank indicated a similarity higher than 99% for the S1 polypeptide, which suggests that this segment is conserved enough to detect humoral responses directed to it.",

Anti-PDCoV antibodies and seroconversion were detected within four weeks of initial observation of clinical disease and detection of PDCoV RNA in fecal samples. Ideally, the cut-off value should be derived by testing a panel of samples obtained from reference animals with known history and infection status relative to the disease [29] . Due to difficulties in classifying pigs from farms as true negative, i.e. no previous exposure to PDCoV which would have required to obtain fecal samples over-time from an adequate number of pigs on the farm, samples from the start of perceived PDCoV outbreaks (PDCoV real-time RT-PCR positive pigs) were considered to be seronegative for test development purposes. Although this strategy was sufficient to confirm diagnosis of acute infection as seroconversion was detected in paired samples from PDCoV outbreaks, the lack of a second serological assay and known negative samples did not permit a precise estimation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test. Selecting a single arbitrary cut-off value entirely on the basis of field samples and association with clinical history and RT-PCR results could result in a loss of sensitivity and/or specificity. To further address this, the established cut-off value of 0.34 was evaluated using the cumulative data of 573 samples originating from seronegative farms (classified as negative due to absence of any PDCoV ELISA positive pig among the pigs tested) by calculating the average OD (data not shown). It was determined that the adoption of this method obtained lower cutoff value (0.24; OD average \u00b1 3 \u00d7 SD; average \u00b1 SD 0.09 \u00b1 0.05), and provided a greater sensitivity. Therefore, samples with an OD value between 0.24 and 0.34 should perhaps be considered inconclusive. The lack of a gold standard for PDCoV antibody detection further contributes to the problem in establishing an appropriated cut-off and accurately measure the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA developed herein. Based on cumulative data from the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratories through 17 Sep 2014, 6.6% (382) of 5827 cases obtained from 17 of 31 states were positive for PDCoV RNA [30] . In the present study, 8.7% (31/ 355) of the serum samples collected from 7/18 states were positive for anti-PDCoV IgG which is in agreement with the Animal and Public Health Information System (APHIS) surveillance data and PDCoV RNA detection by RT-PCR. In contrast, the percentage of PEDV RNA positive cases was 26.0% (8386/32211) obtained from a total of 31/42 U.S. states according to the most recent NAHLN survey [30] . In further agreement, in this study, 22.8% (81/355) of the samples arbitrarily selected in 2014 were positive for PEDV IgG.",

            "text": "PDCoV was first identified in U.S. pigs in 2014 [4] and retrospective studies targeting detection of RNA have been able to identify the virus in late 2013 [30] . Access to archived serum samples can be limited and to overcome this issue, archived porcine plasma samples were also used in this study. While the PEDV assay was not validated on plasma, evidence in the literature suggests that the degree of antibody detection in serum and plasma is essentially identical [31] [32] [33] [34] . Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV has been circulating in the North American pig population prior to 2013 without being recognized. Specifically, antibodies to PDCoV were detected in archived serum and plasma samples from 2010, whereas anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were not detected in serum samples collected in 2011 or 2012. This could be due to the limited number of available retrospective serum samples in combination with an overall low PDCoV seroprevalence. Alternatively, the positive samples collected in 2010 could be false positive; however, at least one sample presented a high OD value. Upon availability of another PDCoV serological test in the future these results will need to be confirmed.",

An acute outbreak was defined as presence of clinical disease and demonstration of PDCoV RNA in feces. Data presented as ELISA OD values \u00b1 SEM.

Anti-PEDV IgG antibodies were detected in 81/355 (22.81%) serum samples and in 28/51 (54.9%) of the investigated farms. Concurrent detection of anti-PEDV and anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies occurred in 8/51 farms (15.7%) and 23/ 355 (6.5%) serum samples. Presence of anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies in pig serum and plasma samples with unknown PDCoV exposure collected prior to 2014 Among the 403 archived serum samples collected between 2006 and 2013, 44 (10.9%) serum samples were found to be positive for anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies by the S1 ELISA (Table 2). The majority of positive samples were collected in 2013 (40/44, 90.9%). On positive farms, 20 to 60% of the serum samples were found to be positive. Interestingly, four samples were collected in 2010; specifically, three serum samples originated on a farm in Illinois and one serum sample was from a farm in Iowa. The OD values on these samples were 0.38, 0.39, 0.42, and 1.27. Due to the limited availability of retrospective sera and to further confirm this finding, 52 porcine pooled plasma samples from 2010 were also tested. Two out of 52 (3.8%) pooled plasma samples were positive for anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies; the OD values were 0.34 and 0.38 whereas the OD values of negative samples ranged from 0.05 to 0.15 (average \u00b1 SD, 0.08 \u00b1 0.01).",
