            "text": "Human norovirus (HuNoV) is responsible for more than 95% of outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions against this virus. Chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based passive immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent and treat many enteric viral diseases. Here, we developed a highly efficient bioreactor to generate high titers of HuNoV-specific IgY in chicken yolks using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing HuNoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) as an antigen. We first demonstrated that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1. Subsequently, we found that White Leghorn hens immunized intramuscularly with rVSV-VP1 triggered a high level of HuNoV-specific yolk IgY antibodies. The purified yolk IgY was efficiently recognized by HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs). Importantly, HuNoV-specific IgY efficiently blocked the binding of HuNoV VLPs to all three types (A, B, and O) of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), the attachment factors for HuNoV. In addition, the receptor blocking activity of IgY remained stable at temperature below 70 \u2022 C and at pH ranging from 4 to 9. Thus, immunization of hens with VSV-VP1 could be a cost-effective and practical strategy for large-scale production of anti-HuNoV IgY antibodies for potential use as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against HuNoV infection.",

Most of these agents are enteric pathogens whose replication and chief clinical manifestations are gastroenteritis and potentially life-threatening diarrhea. Examples of these viruses include human norovirus (HuNoV), porcine norovirus, bovine norovirus, human sapovirus, porcine sapovirus, and the recently discovered Tulane virus. HuNoV is the major food-and water-borne virus that accounts for more than 95% of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide, but this percentage may be underestimated due to In this study, we developed a highly efficient bioreactor for large-scale production of chicken egg yolk IgY antibodies using rVSV-VP1 as an antigen. We found that HuNoV VP1 was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1 and that hens vaccinated rVSV-VP1 induced a high level of HuNoV-specific IgY in egg yolks. Interestingly, intramuscular vaccination of rVSV-VP1 produced approximately three times more HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination route. Importantly, HuNoV-specific IgY produced by rVSV-VP1 vaccination was capable of blocking the binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A, B, and O HBGA receptors. In addition, egg yolk IgY antibodies remained stable at temperature below 70 \u2022 C and at pH ranging from 4 to 9. These data demonstrated that recombinant rVSV-VP1 is a highly effective antigen for large-scale production of HuNoV-specific IgY for passive immunization and therapeutic agent.",

HuNoV VP1 was highly expressed in both BSRT7 and DF-1 cells during 4-30 h postinfection. VP1 expression in DF-1 decreased after 30 h postinfection due to the cell death. Quantitation of three independent experiments showed there were no significant difference in VP1 expression between BSRT7 and DF-1 cells at time points from 4 to 30 h postinfection (p > 0.05) ( Figure 1C ).",

In this assay, human saliva containing HBGA receptors (types A, B, or O) or synthetic HBGAs can be recognized by HuNoV VLPs, which can be further detected by anti-HuNoV serum and a HRP-conjugated second antibody. Therefore, we determined whether total IgY derived from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated hens could be used as the primary antibody for the HBGA binding assay. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with type A, B, or O human saliva, and 200 ng of HuNoV VLPs were added to bind the HBGA receptor. After 1-h incubation, a serial dilution of total IgY was added followed by addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY. After the addition of substrate reagent, an ELISA reader measured OD450. Purified total IgY from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated groups strongly reacted with HuNoV VLPs in the saliva-based HBGA binding assays ( Figure 4A,B) . In contrast, control IgY from pre-immunized hens was negative in this assay. Overall, total IgY from intramuscular vaccination group had significantly higher OD values than those in combined vaccination group (p < 0.05, compare the OD value in Figure 4A ,B). In addition, it appears that VLPs had a stronger binding activity to type A saliva compared to types B and O saliva ( Figure 4A,B) . These results demonstrated that purified total IgY induced by rVSV-VP1 vaccination could be used as a primary antibody to measure binding of HuNoV VLP to all three types of saliva in HBGA binding assays. saliva, and 200 ng of HuNoV VLPs were added to bind the HBGA receptor.

However, VSV has a broad tissue tropism and can replicate to a high titer in many mammalian cell lines, insect cell, yeast, worm, and C. elegans [30, 31] . In this study, we found that rVSV-VP1 replicated to a high titer in DF-1 cells, a continuous cell line derived from chicken embryo fibroblasts. The virus yields in DF-1 cells were comparable to those produced in BSRT7 cell. In addition, rVSV-VP1 produced similar amounts of VP1 protein in both DF-1 and BSRT7 cells. Prior to our study, replication capability of VSV in avian species in vivo was poorly understood. The only report of VSV infection in chickens came from the study of rVSV-based influenza virus vaccine. It was found that chickens vaccinated with rVSV expressing the HA antigen of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N1) triggered a high level of serum neutralizing antibody and provided complete protection against lethal challenge of avian influenza H7N1 [32] . In our study, we found that hens vaccinated with rVSV-VP1 triggered a high level of HuNoV-specific IgY in yolks, further supporting that chickens were susceptible to VSV infection. We also showed that immunization route affected IgY production in hens. We found that intramuscular vaccination triggered a higher HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination although the total IgY levels were similar between two vaccination routes. Our rationale to include nasal drop vaccination is that it may trigger a higher mucosal immunity since egg yolk is developed in reproductive tract of chickens. In fact, our previous mice study showed that oral and intranasal vaccination of rVSV-VP1 trigged a high level of both serum and mucosal antibody [23, 24] .",

There are many potential advantages of using live attenuated rVSV-VP1 for IgY production. First, rVSV-VP1 grows to a high titer in a wide range of cell lines including chicken cells. Second, replication of rVSV-VP1 in chickens resulted in synthesis of large amount of VLPs that in turn triggered a high level of HuNoV antibody. Third, it is an economical and time-saving approach. It does not require purification of VLPs or P particles. Thus, rVSV-VP1 is a promising vaccine antigen for large-scale production of IgY in chickens.",

Second, similar to serum IgG, HuNoV-specific IgYs can be used as a primary antibody in HBGA binding assay. Third, HuNoV-specific IgYs, but not the control IgY, were capable of blocking the binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A, B, and O HBGAs in human saliva. Although it is unknown whether HuNoV-specific IgY can directly neutralize the infectious HuNoV, blockage of virus-receptor interaction will likely block the infectivity of HuNoV, which will prevent HuNoV infection and illness. In 2010, Reeck et al. found a direct correlation between the ability of an antibody to block VLP-HBGA binding and protection against HuNoV infection and illness in a HuNoV human challenge study [34] . In addition, Nurminen et al., (2011) showed that children could be protected from a GII.4 HuNoV infection due to the pre-existing HBGA blocking antibodies [35] . Thus, the IgYs is a promising passive immunization approach to prevent and treat HuNoV infection and illness. Future study will determine whether IgY can directly neutralize infectious HuNoV using the recently developed B cell culture system [8] or human enteroids culture system [9] .",

Antibody-based passive immunization and therapy has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent infectious diseases in many animals [16] . However, preparation of serum antibody from mammals is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, large-scale application of serum antibody has been limited. IgY egg yolk immunoglobulins derived from hyperimmunized hens represent an economically feasible and practical strategy which has been explored for the passive treatment of enteric diseases. Chicken IgY production is a much easier, faster, and cheaper method for polyclonal antibody production than from any other sources. It is easy to raise chickens and collect eggs without involvement of any stressful procedures (such as bleeding). White leghorn chickens are highly productive in laying eggs, and they can continuously produce eggs containing antigen-specific antibodies in their yolks for a long time period after immunization [16] . Nguyen et al. (2010) demonstrated that chicken usually lays 280 eggs/year and each egg yolk normally contains 150-200 mg of IgY, which has 2 to 10% antigen-specific antibodies [42] . In addition, extraction of antibody from egg yolk is simple and noninvasive without affecting the immunized chickens. Therefore, a chicken is an excellent \"factory\" for IgY antibody production.",

Based on the HBGA blocking assay, HuNoV-specific IgY remains stable at temperature below 70 \u2022 C. Thus, it is safe for pasteurization (below 72 \u2022 C) of IgY for human consumption. However, the receptor blocking activity of IgY significantly decreased when temperature reached above 75 \u2022 C, suggesting that IgY may be denatured at this temperature. For oral administration, IgY should ideally be stable in acid or alkaline environment. Our results showed that the receptor blocking activity of IgY decreased at pH below 3 or above 10. Since the stomach pH is~2-3, it may be necessary to encapsulate the IgY in acid resistant capsules so that it can be released in intestines for neutralizing the infectious virus particles. For example, Chang et al. (1999) demonstrated that addition of sugars, glycerol, or glycine to immunoglobulin solutions was effective to protect IgYs. In addition, film coating with gum arabic was proven to be effective in reducing the degree of hydrolysis of IgY [43] .",
