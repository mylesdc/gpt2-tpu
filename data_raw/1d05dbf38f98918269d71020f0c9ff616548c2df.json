In household studies, family members experience rapid rates of reinfection (for instance, up to 5 infections in adults or 12 infections in young children per year) where each infection tends to be caused by a different HRV-type and rarely with the same HRV-type 4,18-20 . At a population level of observation, repeated reinfections in individuals appears to reflect the introduction and circulation of new types in the community, rather than persistence of the same HRV types [21] [22] [23] [24] . These observations are consistent with evidence from immunological studies on HRV that indicate strong homologous type responses and little heterotypic immunity to protect individuals against multiple types [25] [26] [27] . Moreover, studies have shown that individuals develop relatively long-lasting (~ 1 year) type-specific neutralizing antibodies (IgG and IgA) against a specific infecting HRV-type but susceptibility to other different HRV types remains and infection will occur as so long as there is an exposure 28, 29 .",

Our null hypothesis was that HRV is introduced and spreads randomly within a population, and that HRV types circulate independent of each other. Hence, we asked: a) Is there evidence that any health facility had significantly more HRV detections in the sample of NPSs than others? b) Are the frequencies of HRV types found per health facility noticeably different from independent random mixing? c) Moreover, was the pattern of types detected at each facility similar to nearby health facilities compared to further away health facilities? To answer these questions we used a combination of the classification algorithms provided by the Orange data mining toolbox 38 and logistic regression implemented by the MATLAB v9.4 fitglme function. The null hypothesis of independent random HRV type detection was tested using the G-test statistic associated with the contingency table of type frequency per health facility. Type pattern similarity between health facilities was analysed using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) implement in Orange v3.0. MDS represents the similarity between high-dimensional data-points optimally on a low dimensional (in this case two dimensional) Euclidean metric space, thereby revealing patterns and hidden dimensions in the data 39 . The Orange implementation of MDS includes a pairwise similarity network linking all points whose high-dimensional similarity is close compared to the typical similarity between any two data-points; this is a threshold quantity set to the algorithm's maximum therefore including all pairwise connections inferred by the Orange MDS algorithm in our analysis.",

These predictors were identified whether undetermined samples were used in the regression analysis or not. Other factors considered were gender and health facility. First, five standard classification models (logistic regression, neural network using logistic activation functions and one hidden layer, k-nearest neighbor classification, tree and random forest regression) were compared using random partitions of the data into 2/3 training set, 1/3 testing set. Over 100-fold repetitions of training and testing each model, both logistic regression and the neural network classifiers had 77.2% classification accuracy (this increased to 81.0% and 80.9% respectively if undetermined samples were removed from the data set). Other classification models were less successful and because logistic regression is easier to interpret, and likelihood-based, we chose to continue our analysis using only logistic regression. Second, we removed uninformative predictor variables by comparing Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each additive combination of predictor variables and selecting the logistic regression model with lowest AIC. Whether undetermined samples were included in the regression analysis or not, in either case the lowest (i.e. best) AIC model included only month of sample collection and the age of the sample participant as predictors (Supplementary  Table 2 , Supplementary File 1). The most informative models implied that the odds ratio of the participants being detected HRV positive declined by 0.1-0.2% per month of life, and that collection in August to October increased the odds ratio of finding HRV positives (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary  File 1) .",

We measured the pairwise similarity of the type distribution at each health facility as the total absolute differences in their type occurrences shifted by the data median and rescaled by the median absolute distance from median (i.e. the rescaled Manhattan metric recommended for high dimensional data sets 40 ). We used the Orange implementation of MDS (see methods) to optimally represent the type distribution similarities on a plane along with a similarity network ( Figure 4B ). The similarity network distinguishes between the type distributions of health facilities in the central part of Kilifi area on the road network, in particular the central similarity clique (Mtondia, Ngerenya, Sokoke), and the type distribution observed on the outskirts and harder to travel to parts of the Kilifi area.

All three HRV species co-circulated, with HRV-A and HRV-C co-predominant. This observation agrees with a previous study conducted in rural coastal Kenya 41 . Remarkably, a total of 87 HRV types were identified in circulation over the twelve months, representing 51.7% of all known HRV types. Occurrence of HRV throughout the year appears to be sustained by the existence of simultaneous and successive mini-epidemics each caused by a different HRV type introduced into the community independently. We assume each HRV type generates strong and lasting homotypic immunity, that leads to type-specific herd immunity and subsequent fadeout. This observation could be attributed to the natural ability of each type to independently cause an infection with limited cross-immunity with other types 42 . Therefore, as long as there are new introductions and exposure to new HRV-types, the population experiences a series of new HRV infections throughout the year 21-23 .",

The majority of the HRV positive patients were children below the age of 5 years (63.95%) and a statistically significant decrease in HRV positives amongst older ages was observed. The consistent finding of high proportions of HRV infections in children below the age of 5 years reiterates the need to focus control strategies to this age group since they are the most vulnerable, and presumably make the greatest contribution to community transmission. The low rates of detection of HRV types in adults may reflect the gradual development of type-specific immunity due to increased exposure throughout life.",

In some cases, the identical HRV-types were circulating simultaneously in different geographical regions separated by a distance as far as 30 km apart. Supported by the low genetic variation in the VP4/VP2 coding sequences and the concurrent distribution between these identical HRV-types it is probable that there is a rapid spread of HRV-types within the KHDSS once introduced and or many introductions of the same type into different areas of the KHDSS.",

            "text": "Despite phylogenetic evidence for rapid spread across the KHDSS, there is highly significant evidence for variation in the distribution of HRV-types between health facilities. An obvious mechanism that accounts for the variation in HRV-type distribution between health facilities is that transmission occurs more frequently between people attending the same health facility compared to those who attend other health facilities. In this case, sharing a health facility is a proxy for being more likely to live nearby and share the same social amenities and gatherings which are hotspot for transmission of respiratory viruses. Additionally, multidimensional scaling of the type distributions reveals greater type distribution similarity between the health facilities servicing parts of central Kilifi area that are more easily travelled between by road compared to the health facilities located significantly off the highway, or much further north along the highway. Spatial differentiation of type distribution, along with greater similarity in type distribution between the areas where we expect more human co-transit, is consistent with the expectations of spatial metapopulation models of infectious disease transmission 44, 45 . However, it is comparatively rare to be able to demonstrate direct evidence of metapopulation effects in transmission, as we have done (see the discussion in Grenfell et al. 46 ). We ascribed (above) the observation of multiple mini-epidemics in this community, each caused by a different HRV type, to the generation of homotypic herd immunity. If there was stronger heterotypic immunity, we would expect fewer HRV cases, and even periodic HRV fadeout. With strong homotypic and weak heterotypic immunity, we therefore expect newly introduced HRV types to spread unconstrained by pre-existing heterotypic immunity in the population. The differences in circulation periods observed among HRV-types could be as a result of stochastic differences in frequency of introduction and onward transmission of the HRV types, or variation in type-specific immunity. Similar observation has been reported in 47 where simultaneous and successive epidemics caused by different HRV types contributed to HRV high incidence and enabled HRV to remain in the local population for extended periods. In some cases, type-specific epidemics were served with different variants of the same HRV type probably as a result of separate introductions into the community at different times over the year. Moreover, comparing the HRV incidence with other respiratory viruses, as shown in the preceding study 30 , HRV tend to peak in the second half of the year as other respiratory viruses report low incidence during this period. An explanation for this observation could be a case of virus interactions 48,49 that whatever triggers (either environment or biological) high incidence in HRV in the 3 rd quarter of the year, causes low incidence in the other viruses. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether virus interaction affects incidence and transmission of individual viruses in the population.",

First, there was low patient recruitment in the initial study months (December 2015 and January 2016) due to clinic closure on public holidays or people migrating to other areas of the country during festive season. This may have contributed to the lower observed HRV prevalence compared to the other months of study. Second, we failed to sequence the VP4/VP2 coding region for 22.2% of HRV positives samples, possibly due to low virus titers in the nasopharyngeal samples inferred from high Ct values (Ct value>33) in these samples. Third, since a maximum sample number per clinic was fixed, changes in prevalence of one virus, for example during a seasonal peak of coronavirus, would lead to fewer samples testing positive for other viruses. Hence there would be lack of independence of numbers of each virus type, or even between HRV types, over time, affecting temporal patterns of absolute numbers. However, the prevalence of each virus or virus type at any timepoint will reflect that circulating in the community.",

Some of the HRV-types circulated in the KHDSS population close to all months of observation (10/12) suggesting marked local persistence of some types while others appeared and faded from circulation quite rapidly possibly due to low herd homologous immunity for the former and stronger herd homologous immunity in the latter. HRV transmission in the community is enhanced in people living close to one another and between areas linked by road network.

Although heterotypic immunity can be established it is not significant to protect an individual from other multiple HRV types (Stott et al. 1969 ). The duration of homotypic immunity may be enhanced by reinfection with other types due to non-specific boosting of titers of types to which individuals were previously exposed (Fleet et al. 1965 ). Our own recent study of household HRV infection revealed rapid heterotypic reinfection in younger individuals (e.g. the median time to reinfection in 1-10 year olds was 1month), with a decreasing rate in older individuals ) who presumably had past experience of more types and hence reduced susceptibility.",

The review also suggests that HRV partnership with host immunity can be mutual, incidentally giving the host an advantage by protecting against more cytopathic viral pathogens in the respiratory system while the host provides a vessel for HRV replication and transmission.",
