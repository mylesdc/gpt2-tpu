PFGE analysis with SmaI suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. There were two large emm12 clones, one with DNA resistant to cleavage by SmaI. Each prevalent emm clone had major PFGE strain(s) and many minor strains. Most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. Even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2-3 years before declining. The large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. In 2003, the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred between late-February and mid-June in Taiwan.",

It also causes non-suppurative sequelae, including acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis and acute arthritis [1] . Scarlet fever, characterized by a sore throat, skin rash and strawberry tongue, is most prevalent in school children aged four to seven years old. This disease was listed as a notifiable disease in Taiwan until 2007; as such, all cases of scarlet fever had to be reported to the public heath department. According to our records, however, only 9% of the medical centers, regional hospitals and district hospitals in central Taiwan reported cases of scarlet fever to the health authorities between 1996 and 1999. The number of scarlet fever cases is therefore likely to be significantly underreported. Scarlet fever outbreaks frequently occur in young children at day-care centers, kindergartens and elementary schools [2, 3] and also occur in adults upon exposure to contaminated food [4] .",

In a previous study, we used emm (gene of M protein) sequencing [5] , vir typing [6] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing to analyze a collection of streptococcal isolates from scarlet fever patients and used these data to build a DNA fingerprint and emm sequence database for long-term disease surveillance [7] . Vir typing has since been abandoned in our lab because it has lower discriminatory power than PFGE and the protocol is difficult to standardize with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. In contrast, the PFGE protocol for S. pyogenes has been standardized in our laboratory, and a second enzyme, SgrAI, has been found to replace SmaI for analysis of strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion [7] . Since PFGE is highly discriminative and emm sequencing provides unambiguous sequence information regarding emm type, we adopted these two genotyping methods to characterize streptococcal isolates and build a Streptococcus pyogenes DNA fingerprint and sequence database for the long-term study of scarlet fever and other streptococcal diseases.

The population in northern, central, southern, and eastern areas is 10.2, 5.7, 6.4 and 0.6 million, respectively. Nationwide information for all notifiable diseases has been systematically collected since 2000. For accurate analysis, the number of confirmed scarlet fever cases was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases and the specimen positive rate. The total, adjusted number of confirmed cases throughout the whole country increased from 716 cases in 2000 to 1, 258 The profiles of weekly reported cases revealed that scarlet fever was more prevalent in the winter and spring seasons (2 nd -25 th weeks) in 2000-2006. However, there was a remarkable decrease in the number of cases in the 6 th and 7 th weeks ( Figure 1B ). This decrease may be due to the long holiday of the traditional lunar New Year and winter break from school, as it is usually from late-January to mid-February (4 th -7 th weeks). The weekly reported number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was mostly higher than the weekly average from 2000 to 2006 ( Figure 1B ). In 2003, except in the 11 th week, the number of weekly reported cases in the first 16 weeks was greater than the average. Furthermore, the number of cases between the 4 th and 9 th weeks was even higher than that in 2002. After the 16 th week, the number of cases in 2003 was below the overall average and was significantly decreased from the 17 th to 24 th week (mid-April to mid-June). A lower level of reported cases lasted until the first half of year 2004. In early 2003, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in Taiwan. There were two stages for the SARS epidemic: stage I occurred from late-February to mid-April (9 th -16 th week), with scattered sporadic cases, and stage II occurred between mid-April and mid-June (17 th -24 th week), with severe nosocomial infections in several hospitals. The dramatic decline of scarlet fever notifications in 2003 occurred during the stage II period of the SARS epidemic.",

            "text": "The 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates were analyzed by PFGE with SmaI to investigate the clonal relationship among the isolates. There were 127 isolates with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion, and their pattern (with only one DNA band) was referred to as a SPYS16.0026 PFGE-SmaI type. The 127 isolates with the SPYS16.0026 genotype were further analyzed by digestion with SgrAI. The genetic relatedness of the bacterial strains was evaluated by the levels of similarity among the PFGE-SmaI patterns. A dendrogram was constructed using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmatic mean (UPGMA) algorithm. The dendrogram revealed that all of the emm4 and emm6 isolates, as well as the majority of emm1 and emm22 isolates, were each distributed in a unique cluster. However, the emm12 isolates were located in two distinct clusters and two singletons ( Figure 2 ). One of these clusters included 125 emm12 isolates that were resistant to SmaI digestion. Clustering analysis indicated that isolates with a common emm type were, in general, more closely related than those with different emm types. However, there were a few exceptions. Two strains with different emm types (emm101 and st5282) had indistinguishable PFGE-SmaI patterns, and a strain with a stIL103 type was located within the emm1 cluster ( Figure 2 ). stIL103 is an allele of emm1 that lacks the codons encoding the mature M1 7-24 residues (http:/ /www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strepindex.htm; accessed on April 20 th , 2009). Sequence analysis suggests that the st5282 strain could be derived from an emm101 strain via emm gene recombination, as the sequence for the first 26 codons of the st5282 gene were identical to that for the emm101 gene. Two emm12 and one emm22 isolates were distant from the major emm12 and emm22 clusters ( Figure 2 emm102  emm92  emm103  emm6  emm6  emm6  emm6  emm6  emm6  emm6  emm6  st5282  emm101  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm12  emm81  emm82  emm77  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm22  emm11  emm2  emm2  emm2  emm12  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm4  emm22  emm28  emm49  emm49  emm89  emm89  emm89  emm76  st2904  emm12  stG485  emm1  emm1  stIL103  emm1  emm1  emm1  emm1  emm12  emm1  emm58   1  1  1  33  3  1  1  1  1  4  2  1  1  3  1  1  14  1  10  3  6  1  2  8  1  1  2  12  2  360  3  4  1  1  7  1  1  28  2  3  2  2  2  2  1  1  1  1  11  1  15  4  1  1  1  11  1  1  3  1  99  142  1  1  1  1  1  1  32  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  4  1  1  1  1  2  1  1  182  12  1  2  1  1  1  125  1 isolates were distributed in two distinct clusters, A and B ( Figure 3 ).

The stIL103 strain is an exception to this, as it shared high PFGE pattern similarity with the cluster of emm1 strains and was therefore considered to be part of the emm1 clone. Based on the groupings made by the PFGE patterns, six major emm (emm1, emm4, emm6, emm12, emm12* and emm22) clones were identified and are shown in Figure 2 . (Table 1) , and 115 to 273 isolates were collected each year for genotyping. The number of isolates genotyped was adjusted to the number of annual confirmed cases to investigate the association of the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases and the relative prevalence of the emm clones. As shown in Figure [10] . In our study, the most common emm types in 427 isolates collected in the same time period in central Taiwan were emm12 (35.6%), emm1 (34.2%), emm4 (18.5%), emm6 (7.5%) and emm11 (0.9%). stIL103 was present in northern Taiwan, but it was not found in the central region during the same time period. Thus, the distribution and frequency of emm types appear to be geographically varied even in such a small country. The geographic variation in the prevalence of emm clones may explain why the epidemiological trend of scarlet fever in 2006 in central Taiwan was different from that in the whole country.",

The emm12 strains belong to two major clones and two singletons, and emm22 strains belong to one major clone and one singleton (Figure 2) . Thus, six emm clones caused most (96.5%) of the scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan emm12* emm12 emm4 emm1 emm6 emm22 Other time period. The fluctuation of scarlet fever cases was associated with the shuffling of the prevalent emm clones (Figure 4) . The finding that only a few prevalent M (emm) types caused most occurrences of scarlet fever in a specific location in a given year period, as well as the shuffling of predominant M types, has been observed in many epidemiological studies in the early 20 th century [11] . During major epidemics of streptococcal infections in previous years, only a few serotypes predominated, and the strains were rich in M protein, encapsulated and were highly virulent [11] . Type-specific immunity was important for preventing re-infection with the same M type. It is thought that the shuffling of predominant M types is due to the type-specific immunity, leading to the decline of infections with certain M types and the emergence of other virulent M types. In the present study, the prevalence of the emm12*, emm1 and emm6 clones both increased and decreased within one year. In contrast, the emm12 and emm4 clones persisted throughout the seven year period. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that the emm12 and emm4 clones produced less M protein and were less virulent than the emm12*, emm1 and emm6 clones.",

However, the dramatic drop in reported cases in 2003 is difficult to explain. In early 2003, Taiwan was badly hit by a severe SARS outbreak. The SARS epidemic in Taiwan had two distinct stages, with the beginning in the late-February (the 9 th week) and the second ending in mid-June [13] . The stage I epidemic occurred from late-February to mid-April (the 9 th to 16 th week) and consisted of only scattered, sporadic cases, with most of the patients having recently traveled to China. In this stage, the disease did not cause much panic and the level of scarlet fever remained high. In stage II (from mid-April to mid-June or the 17 th to 24 th week), several clusters of infection occurred via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. Enormous panic spread over the whole country after an outbreak of nosocomial infection was confirmed on the 22 nd of April. The disease was subsequently transmitted to several hospitals and spread from the North to the South. The number of scarlet fever cases dropped remarkably during this period. Because a large portion of the SARS infections was associated with hospitals, fear of SARS drove people out of hospitals and public places. This fear and the change of people's behavior may have significantly reduced the number of outpatients and the transmission of many infectious diseases, including scarlet fever. In fact, the SARS outbreak had a long-term effect on the occurrences of scarlet fever. After the SARS epidemic, the number of weekly scarlet fever reports was often lower than the overall average until the first half of 2004.",

Confirmed cases were those in which S. pyogenes was isolated from the specimens. The number of annual confirmed cases detected through the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases and the rate of positive specimens. S. pyogenes isolates used for characterization in this study were obtained directly from hospitals located in central Taiwan through the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System or were recovered from throat swab specimens collected from hospitals and clinics through the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System and the Sentinel Physician Active Reporting System.",
