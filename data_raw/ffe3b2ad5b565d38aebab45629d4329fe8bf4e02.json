While such events are virtually impossible to predict, wildlife screening for potential emerging pathogens can be a first step.

Methods: As part of a bigger study investigating pathogens in African bats we screened animals for the presence of known and unknown viruses. Results: We isolated and characterised a novel reovirus from blood of free-tailed bats (Chaereophon aloysiisabaudiae) captured in 2006 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The virus showed closest relationship with two human pathogenic viruses, Colorado tick fever virus and Eyach virus, and was able to infect various human cell lines in vitro.",

It is currently divided into two subfamilies; the Sedoreovirinae comprising six, and the Spinareovirinae comprising nine genera [15] . The genus Coltivirus in the latter subfamily is comprised of two species only: Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) and Eyach virus (EYAV). CTFV is the etiologic agent of a febrile human disease, Colorado tick fever, occurring in the Rocky Mountains in the Western United States and Canada [16] [17] [18] . It is rarely fatal but can cause severe complications like encephalitis, haemorrhage, or pericarditis, especially in children [19] . The related EYAV was isolated in Germany in 1976 and has been associated with human neurological disease by serological evidence [20, 21] . Animal reservoirs of coltiviruses are small mammals like rodents and lagomorphs and transmission to humans occurs by ticks of the family Ixodidae [18, 22, 23] . We describe a novel reovirus, designated Ta\u00ef Forest reovirus (TFRV), which is closely related to coltiviruses, a genus not described in bats before, isolated from blood of African free-tailed bats (Chaereophon aloysiisabaudiae).",

Blood was taken from the wing vein and mixed with EDTA to prevent coagulation. Animals were released immediately after the procedure. All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen, transported on dry ice and transferred to \u221280\u00b0C at the Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin for long-time storage. Primary virus isolation was achieved on VeroE6 cells. For inoculation 50 \u03bcl of blood from each of three individuals Ch. aloysiisabaudiae was pooled. Cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in 25 cm 2 cell culture flasks. Prior to inoculation cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by medium without supplements. Cells were inoculated with blood diluted in PBS to a final volume of 2 ml. After 1-2 h 3 ml of medium including 2% Fetal Calf Serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin was added and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . After 24 h cells were washed with PBS and medium was replaced. Cells were then incubated for 7 days and monitored daily microscopically for the presence of a cytopathic effect (CPE). After 7 days 300 \u03bcl supernatant was used to infect fresh cells. A CPE was observed at day five in the second passage. To prepare virus stocks virus was grown in a 175 cm 2 flask and virus particles isolated by ultracentrifugation through a 36% sucrose solution for 4 h at 28,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C in a Beckmann ultracentrifuge (rotor SW 32 Ti, Beckman Coulter).",

Of the resulting sequences nine contigs and three individual reads showed homologies with two viruses, CTFV and EYAV, when compared to GenBank entries. The CTFV genome was used as reference genome to map contigs of the novel virus so as to get a possible arrangement, based on which sequence gaps were closed with primers directed outwards from known fragments (described in detail in [25] ). Segment ends of three identified segments (S1, S2, S9) were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Thermo Fisher). In parallel, RNA was applied to 454 next generation sequencing (Roche), resulting in a total of 222,953 reads. Reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic version 0.33 [26] and all trimmed reads shorter than 250 bases were discarded. The resulting 135,911 reads were separated into pathogen and host reads using RAMBO-K version 1.2 [27] (background reference: Chlorocebus sabaeus, GCF_000409795.2; foreground references: Eyach virus, NC_003696-NC_003707, and Colorado tick fever virus, NC_004180-NC_004191) using a k-mer length of 4 and a cutoff score of \u22122.5, yielding 71,962 potential foreground reads. These reads were assembled together with the available Sanger sequences using SPAdes version 3.8.1 [28] . Of the 250 contigs reconstructed by SPAdes, only 38 were longer than 300 bases. BLASTX of these 38 contigs was performed against a custom database of the Eyach virus and Colorado tick fever virus genomes using Geneious Pro version 10 [29] , with 10 contigs showing significant similarity to 9 known segments. In an iterative process, all reads were mapped back to the contigs, and the mapping reads were re-assembled, until no new unambiguously mapping reads could be identified and contigs could not be extended anymore. Finally, a last round of mapping all reads to all contigs was performed for error correction.",

Using Sanger and 454 sequencing methodology nine segments of the novel virus could be assembled. Segments 1, 2, and 9 were completely assembled whereas for segments 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11 ends are missing. For segment 4 two long contigs were assembled but not combined to one long contig. No sequence information was identified for segments 6, 7 and 12. Table 1 provides comparison between identified segments those of CTFV and EYAV. Table 1 provides an overview about similarities between the segments and CTFV and EYAV segments. The novel virus was tentatively named Ta\u00ef Forest Reovirus (TFRV), based on the origin of its host. With few exceptions reovirus segments commonly contain one ORF coding for a single protein, flanked by noncoding regions and conserved terminal sequence motifs. Identified segments of TFRV are monocistronic with the exception of one segment, which putatively contains two overlapping ORFs, mediated through an Opal stop codon, followed by a cytosine residue. This construction allows for two proteins of different lengths, but beginning with the same start codon, a shorter viral protein 9 (VP9) and a longer VP9' protein [17, 18, 35] . Segment lengths and putative start codons in comparison to CTFV and EYAV are listed in Table 1 Virus protein (VP) 1 of TFRV contains RNA polymerase domains (UniProt Q9DSQ0) and putatively encodes for a RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This is supported by the presence of two functional motifs that are present in all reovirus RdRp genes [18] : motif SG (positions 754-755 for CTFV and EYAV, positions 753-754 for TFRV) and motif GDD (positions 816-818 for CTFV and EYAV, 814-816 for TFRV). VP2 on segment 2 might code for a RNA methyltransferase according to UniProt (Q9ENL4), VP3 on segment 3 for a membrane protein (UniProt Q9ENL3), the ORFs VP9 and VP9' on S9 for a structural and nonstructural protein (UniProt O93214 and O55265), respectively, and VP10 for a microtubule-associated protein (UniProt Q9ENK7).",

However, the induction of a CPE on a wide range of mammalian cells, including human cells, together with its close phylogenetic relationship to human pathogenic viruses, allows for speculation about the ability of TFRV to infect humans. Febrile symptoms, as caused by CTFV, are common in tropical regions and can account for a number of different diseases. In Africa, Based on present data we cannot infer whether Ch. aloysiisabaudiae is an accidental host or represents the true reservoir of TFRV. No TFRV was detected in any other bat species, including one individual of the related species Ch. russata. Ch. aloysiisabaudiae is widely distributed across the sub-Saharan Africa. Besides the forest zones in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and western Ghana, it is also present in Central Africa along a stretch from Cameroon to South Sudan and Uganda. Since populations are spatially separated it would be of interest to look for TFRV in central African bats to further explore its epidemiology. The screening of ticks could also be of interest. Ixodid ticks are the vector for infecting humans with CTFV and EYAV and are also present in Africa [36] . The close relationship of the viruses and the observation that TFRV infects insect cell lines in vitro allows for the possibility that it also requires ticks or another vector to spread. Despite the fact that this would limit the possibility for transmission to a region with a geographical overlap of bats, vector, and humans, the presence of the virus in blood raises concern about transmission by bloodfeeding vectors. TFRV is able to infect cells from various mammals in vitro and it might be that other mammals or vectors also play a role in the virus' ecology. Development of a serological test to screen animals and humans from the Ta\u00ef region for antibodies against TFRV would help to shed light on the potential transmission of this novel reovirus in the Ta\u00ef Forest Region and along the distribution of Ch. aloysiisabaudiae.",
