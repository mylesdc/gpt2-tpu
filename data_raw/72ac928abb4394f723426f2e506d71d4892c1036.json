            "text": "The negative transcription regulator of the ica locus, TcaR, regulates proteins involved in the biosynthesis of poly-Nacetylglucosamine (PNAG). Absence of TcaR increases PNAG production and promotes biofilm formation in Staphylococci. Previously, the 3D structure of TcaR in its apo form and its complex structure with several antibiotics have been analyzed. However, the detailed mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family proteins such as TcaR is unclear and only restricted on the binding ability of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). Here we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), electron microscopy (EM), circular dichroism (CD), and Biacore analysis that TcaR can interact strongly with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), thereby identifying a new role in MarR family proteins. Moreover, we show that TcaR preferentially binds 33-mer ssDNA over double-stranded DNA and inhibits viral ssDNA replication. In contrast, such ssDNA binding properties were not observed for other MarR family protein and TetR family protein, suggesting that the results from our studies are not an artifact due to simple charge interactions between TcaR and ssDNA. Overall, these results suggest a novel role for TcaR in regulation of DNA replication. We anticipate that the results of this work will extend our understanding of MarR family protein and broaden the development of new therapeutic strategies for Staphylococci.

S. aureus is the most well-known of the species which produce hospital-and community-acquired infections, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus presenting a serious public health threat [1] . S. epidermidis is the sister species of S. aureus which often causes infection in immunocompromised individuals or those following damage to the epithelium. Both of them produce biofilm to protect themselves from host immune system and enhance their resistance to antibiotic chemotherapy [2] . The key component of the biofilm extracellular matrix in Staphylococci is polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) [3] , an essential factor in biofilm formation composed of homopolymer of b-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The production of PIA depends on the expression of the icaADBC operon, and TcaR and IcaR are a weak and a strong negative regulator of transcription of the ica locus, respectively [4] .",

            "text": "The transcription regulator TcaR is a member of the MarR family, and is involved in teicoplanin and methicillin resistance in Staphylococci [5] . The MarR family proteins function as regulators of protein expression and these regulated proteins confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, household disinfectants, organic solvent virulence factors, and oxidative stress agents [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . The crystal structures of a number of MarR family proteins have been reported, including MarR from Escherichia coli [12] , OhrR from Bacillis subtilis [13] , MexR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [14] , MarR from Xanthomonas campestris [15] , SlyA from Salmonella typhimurium [16] , AdcR from Streptococcus pneumonia [10] and TcaR, which is studied in this work, from S. epidermidis [17] . These structures revealed that MarR family proteins are all homodimers. The overall structure of each monomer could be divided into two functional domains, one is the dimerization domain and the other is the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domain. The N and the C-terminal a-helices (a1, 5, 6) of one monomer interdigitate with those of the other monomer to produce dimerization interaction. In addition, the wHTH DNA binding domain is composed of a2-a3-a4-bA-W1-bB which adopts the winged-helix-fold, and the amino acid sequences of this domain are highly conserved.",

It is not only as a regulatory factor to affect the transcription of icaADBC [4] , the first regulator reported for cell wall-anchored proteins (SpA and sasF), but also as the regulator of sarS [18, 19] . We previously described the 3D structures of TcaR in its apo form and in complex with salicylate as well as several aminoglycoside and b-lactam antibiotics [17] . In this research, comparison of the native TcaR structures and those in complexes indicated that the regulation mechanism involves a large conformational shift in the DNA binding lobe. Several antimicrobial compounds inhibited TcaR-DNA interaction and further induced biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. In the present study, we found that TcaR could interact with ssDNA and the result demonstrated that TcaR shows a stronger preference toward GCrich ssDNA than to dsDNA by using EMSA, CD, and Biacore experiments. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between TcaR and ssDNA still remains to be elucidated. In order to investigate the regulation mechanism of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR, we applied electron microscopy (EM) technique to reveal TcaR-ssDNA complex. Furthermore, we clarified the role of TcaR-ssDNA interaction by in vitro replication assay and in vivo plaque assay. Taken together, these results provide an in-depth investigation on the multiple functions of TcaR in S. epidermidis.",

We previously identified that TcaR most strongly interacts with IcaR DNA1 (a 33-mer pseudo-palindromic sequence containing consensus sequence TTNNAA) compared with other designed IcaR DNA fragments [17] . However, when using the sense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1S) and the antisense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1A) ( Figure 1A ) as controls in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the result demonstrated that TcaR shows a stronger preferences toward ssDNA fragments (IcaR DNA1S and DNA1A) ( Figure 1B) . To determine the type and length of the TcaR-binding site on ssDNA, a series of GC-rich and AT-rich ssDNA segments were designed ( Figure 1A ) [20, 21] . Their TcaR binding ability was tested using EMSA. As shown in Figure 1C , TcaR does not significantly interact with 17-mer GCrich (GC17) and AT-rich (AT17) ssDNA oligomers, but shows strong interaction with 33-mer GC-rich (GC33) and AT-rich (AT33) ssDNA sequences with a preference toward the 33-mer ssDNA sequence with a molar ratio of 1:1. Thus, we suggest that TcaR prefers binding to the 33-mer ssDNA.",

These results indicated that the minimal observed ssDNA fragment size to allow TcaR binding ranges between 17 to 25mer; providing useful information for the design of a DNA fragment with precise length suitable for crystal packing.

The second one is complexed with salicylate [12, 17, 22, 23] and we discovered the third case which is complexed with antibiotics [17] . We have already obtained TcaR-ssDNA crystals and collected X-ray diffraction data to 3.6 \u00c5 resolution at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), beamline BL12B2.

For the competition assay, the IcaR DNA1 probe was preincubated with TcaR (dimer) protein to allow formation of the dsDNA-TcaR complex prior to mixing with increasing amounts of single-stranded GC33 DNA. It has been known that ssDNA products have lower migration velocity compared to its dsDNA counterparts in polyacrylamide electrophoresis [24, 25] . As shown in Figure 1E , ssDNA, as a competitor, interfered the binding of TcaR to the dsDNA, suggesting a binding preference for ssDNA. To further confirm this result, IcaR DNA1 and GC33 ssDNA oligomers were mixed, and their interaction strengths with TcaR were compared using EMSA ( Figure 1F ). Findings indicated that increasing the concentration of TcaR produces a ssDNA band shift greater than that for dsDNA, confirming a stronger interaction between TcaR and ssDNA. Moreover, to investigate possible pH effect of ssDNA binding activity of TcaR, a series of buffers with increasing pH were tested for their potential interfere in TcaR-ssDNA binding. As shown in Figure 1G , the EMSA results showed that TcaR had a strongest affinity for GC33 at pH 8.0 and the affinity was reduced by decreasing pH. Consequently, the result indicates that the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR is pH-dependent.",

Results indicated that ampicillin also antagonized the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR at a concentration of 20 mM. This result is consistent with the observation seen in SPR, as discussed below.

Increasing concentrations of TcaR were passed across a flow cell coated with ssDNA GC33 and the binding response was recorded as changes in response units (RU) after subtraction of the binding response for the reference flow cell. Figure 2A shows a representative sensorgram. Analysis of the sensorgram data indicates k a for the interaction of TcaR with the ssDNA GC33 is 8.8610 5 M 21 s 21 ; k d for the interaction of TcaR with the ssDNA GC33 is 9.5610 23 s 21 (Table 1) . To investigate whether TcaR binds to different types and different lengths of DNA molecules, Biacore experiment was used to test the binding of TcaR to DNA fragments of biotin-labeled ssDNA and hairpin DNA duplex (IcaR DNA1). Consistent with previous observations in Fig. 1B , TcaR binds to ssDNA GC33 and ssDNA AT33 with the higher affinity and the association rates of TcaR to IcaR DNA1, and ssDNA GC17, ranging from 4.3610 5 M 21 s 21 to 1.2610 5 M 21 s 21 , are much lower (shown in Figure 2B ). However, when look at a wider range of DNA sizes, TcaR showed no detectable binding ability to ssDNA 8-mer GC8 but the highest binding ability to ssDNA GC99. The association rate with ssDNA GC99 is 36-fold higher than with ssDNA GC33, along with a 20-fold higher off-rate, suggested that cooperative binding of TcaR may contribute significantly in its ssDNA binding activity (Table 1) . Interestingly, the association rate of GC33 ssDNA is two-times higher than IcaR DNA1, but the dissociation rate of IcaR DNA1 is the lowest compared to the DNA fragments tested in this study, suggesting different modes of interaction occurs in ssDNA-TcaR and dsDNA-TcaR complex ( Figure 2B ).",

The result shows that not all MarR family proteins have this ssDNA binding ability, thus pointing to the specific ssDNA-binding feature of TcaR. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that antibiotics appear to antagonize the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR ( Figure 1I ). Therefore, a measurement for the effect of kanamycin and ampicillin to the GC33 ssDNA binding affinity of TcaR is conducted using surface plasmon resonance to confirm the result. As seen in Figure 2D , the affinity between TcaR and GC33 ssDNA is shown by a decrease in RU values in the presence of antibiotics. This was especially apparent with kanamycin, which yield the lower binding capacity.

As shown in Figure 4A , TcaR reduced the mobility of the M13 and wX174 ssDNA, but S. epidermidis IcaR and S. aureus MarR family protein SAR2349 had no specific interactions with ssDNA. This indicated that TcaR has strong viral ssDNA-binding ability. It is also worth noting that other MarR family protein and TetR family protein do not have such ssDNA binding properties with high affinity, suggesting that the results from TcaR studies are not an artifact due to simple charge interactions between TcaR and ssDNA. Furthermore, since the attempt to obtain the TcaR-ssDNA complex structure was not successful, we resorted to EM analysis to image TcaR-wx174 complex and to pursue its 3-D reconstruction. After staining for 4 min with 2.5% uranyl acetate, EM analysis was performed with a Tecnai tm G 2 Spirit Bio TWIN (FEI CO., The Netherlands) using 120kV acceleration voltage. As seen in Figure 4B -D, EM imaging revealed that no complex was found in the negative control sections, whereas TcaR form a nucleoprotein filament with a circular viral wX174-ssDNA fully covered with proteins, suggesting strong and cooperatively interaction between viral ssDNA and TcaR. This is consistent with the EMSA results we observed. We are now testing another EM method as described by Lurz R et al. [28] to confirm the cooperative binding between the TcaR and viral wX174-ssDNA.",

Because TcaR is known as a MarR family transcription regulator that binds to specific dsDNA sequence with the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domain, the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR may not be involved in transcription. In order to clarify the role of TcaR-viral ssDNA interaction, our approach is to examine it with in vitro replication. We used single-primed M13 replication assay to measure the ability of purified TcaR protein to convert a primed single-strand M13 template to the duplex form in a manner that requires processive DNA synthesis. As seen in Figure 5A , M13-based in vitro DNA replication assay showed that the addition of TcaR protein to the reaction mixture, and incubation for up to 30 min, resulted in almost no DNA replication activity compared to controls. This indicated that TcaR markedly inhibits DNA replication and that the mechanism of inhibition, at least in part, involves interaction with viral ssDNA. These results suggest a possible role for TcaR in bacteriophage resistance.",

Reports have described that appropriately administered phages can treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, and S. aureus [32, 33, 34, 35] . Antibiotic resistance has become a global public health concern; thus investigators are extensively reevalu-ating phage therapies to fully exploit their antimicrobial potential [36, 37] . However, phages encounter a variety of different antiviral mechanisms during their infection of bacterial cells, such as prevention of phage adsorption and DNA entry, cutting of phage nucleic acids, and abortive infection systems [38] . Most reported antiphage systems have been shown to be relevant to the dsDNA phage, but not ssDNA, ssRNA, or dsRNA phages. To further confirm and clarify the first relationship between the TcaR protein and ssDNA phage resistance, the standard plaque assay was performed in E. coli as a model system since little is known about the ssDNA phage infecting Staphylococci. As seen in Figure 5B , induction of the TcaR protein in E. coli conferred increased host resistance to ssDNA phage (M13 and wX174) infection. However, a TcaR-expressing strain did not demonstrate reduced sensitivity to dsDNA phage Lambda (l) infection, suggesting that the phage resistance was caused by TcaR-viral ssDNA complex. The observed biological differences point to a remarkable plasticity of TcaR. These findings, thus, may support a hypothesis that TcaR might interfere with viral ssDNA replication and establish a link between TcaR and ssDNA phage resistance.",

This construct was transferred into E. coli of Arctic Express TM (DE3) RIL strain. The His 6 -tagged wild-type protein was over-expressed in Difco Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 50 mg/l ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5-0.6 and then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside). Cells were grown for 2 days at 16uC. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min and disrupted by Constant Cell Disruption System (CONSTANT SYSTEM Ltd, UK) with lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000g for 30 min and the cell-free extract was loaded onto a Ni 2+ -NTA column, which had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buffer, and the His 6 -tagged SAR2349 was subsequently eluted by a linear gradient of imidazole from 10 mM to 500 mM. His-tagged SAR2349 eluted was dialyzed twice against 5 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM NaCl) and then subjected to Thrombin digestion to remove the tag. The mixture was then passed through another Ni 2+ -NTA column, and subsequently untagged SAR2349 protein was dialyzed twice against 3 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then passed through a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column for further purification, and subsequently SAR2349 was eluted by a linear gradient of 10 mM to 500 mM NaCl-containing buffer and then dialyzed twice against 5 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) for storage. The purified SAR2349 protein was finally concentrated by 3 kDa cut-off size membrane of Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, MA, USA) for storage at -80uC.",

The photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V during the analysis. CD spectra were normalized by subtraction of the background scan with buffer alone. The mean residue ellipticity, [h], was calculated based on the equation, [h] = MRW6hl/ 106l6c, where MRW is the mean residue weight, hl is the measured ellipticity in milidegrees at wavelength l, l is the cuvette pathlength (0.1 cm), and c is the protein concentration in g/mL.",

A droplet (4 ml) was placed for 1 min at room temperature on a copper grid (300 mesh, Pelco, USA) coated with fresh carbon. The excess buffer was then carefully blotted away from the edge of the grid with Whatman #1 filter paper (Whatman Inc., USA). After staining for 1 min with 2% uranyl acetate, excess liquid was removed and samples were dried at room temperature.

Cells were grown in LB media until the optical density (OD 600 ) reached 0.6.

(A) SPR sensorgram of the binding of varying concentrations of TcaR(4,8,16,32, 64 nM) to biotin-labeled GC33 ssDNA (33mer GC-rich single-stranded DNA fragment) captured on SA chip with a ligand density of 120RU. The increase in RUs from the baseline was measured and used to calculated k a and k d . One RU represents the binding of approximately 1 pg protein/mm 2 . (B) Comparison of SPR derived binding curves for different types of immobilized biotin-labeled DNA fragments interacting with TcaR protein (64 nM). The sensograms represent binding of, from bottom to top: GC8, GC17, IcaR DNA1, AT33 and GC33. The association (k a ) and dissociation rate constants (k d ) were derived by fitting the sensograms to a Langumir binding rate equations and are tabulated inTable 1.

The results of the CD experiment reported herein provide strong evidence that TcaR exhibits strong binding affinity for viral ssDNA.",
