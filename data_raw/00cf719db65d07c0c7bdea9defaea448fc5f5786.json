In order to better understand such multiscale interactions, we have implemented a systems immunology approach focusing on the analysis of the structure, dynamics and operating principles of virus-host interactions which constrain the initial spread of the pathogen. Using high-resolution experimental data sets coming from the well-described mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model, we first calibrated basic modules including MHV infection of its primary target cells, i.e. pDCs and macrophages (Mws). These basic building blocks were used to generate and validate an integrative mathematical model for in vivo infection dynamics. Parameter estimation for the system indicated that on a per capita basis, one infected pDC secretes sufficient type I IFN to protect 10 3 to 10 4 Mws from cytopathic viral infection. This extremely high protective capacity of pDCs secures the spleen's capability to function as a 'sink' for the virus produced in peripheral organs such as the liver. Furthermore, our results suggest that the pDC population in spleen ensures a robust protection against virus variants which substantially down-modulate IFN secretion. However, the ability of pDCs to protect against severe disease caused by virus variants exhibiting an enhanced liver tropism and higher replication rates appears to be rather limited. Taken together, this systems immunology analysis suggests that antiviral therapy against cytopathic viruses should primarily limit viral replication within peripheral target organs.",

            "text": "The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection represents a wellunderstood paradigmatic system for the analysis of type I IFN responses. MHV is a member of the Coronaviridae family that harbor a number of viruses causing severe diseases in animals and humans, such as acute hepatitis, encephalitis, infectious bronchitis, lethal infectious peritonitis, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [6, 7] . In systemic MHV infection, spleen and liver represent major target organs [8] , and primarily hematopoietic cell-derived type I IFN controls viral replication and virusinduced liver disease [9] . We could recently show that pDCs are the major cell population generating IFN-a during the initial phase of mouse coronavirus infection [8] . Importantly, mainly macrophages (Mw) and, to a lesser extent conventional DCs, respond most efficiently to the pDC-derived type I IFN and thereby secure containment of MHV within SLOs [10] . Thus, the type I IFN-mediated crosstalk between pDCs and Mws represents an essential cellular pathway for the protection against MHVinduced liver disease. In system biology terms, MHV infection triggers a complex array of processes at different biological scales such as protein expression, cellular migration, or pathological organ damage. To focus on the front edge of the virus-host interaction, the present analysis specifically addresses the early dynamics (i.e. the first 48 h) of the type I IFN response to MHV since this is decisive for the outcome of the infection. The reductionist's view of the most essential processes underlying the early systemic dynamics of MHV infection, liver pathology and the first wave of type I IFN production is summarized in Figure 1A .",

Under the condition of pDC-deficiency or lack of type I IFN responsiveness of Mws, a severe disease is observed [8, 10] indicating that the operation of the spleen might switch from a 'virus sink' to a 'virus source' mode. This bi-modal function, i.e. the ability of the spleen to either eliminate or disseminate the virus, is outlined in Figure 1B . The switch between the two modes most likely depends on the number of pDCs in spleen, their activation status, the dose of infection, and the kinetics of virus spread. Thus, for an improved understanding of pDC function in cytopathic virus infection, it is of fundamental importance to determine the robustness and fragility of the early type I IFN response within SLOs in relation to the ability of the virus to counteract the IFN system and to replicate and cause severe disease in peripheral tissues. Because of the inherent complexity of the virus-host system, experimental approaches to examine the dynamical aspects of such multiscale interactions are limited. Therefore, we have used mathematical modeling in conjunction with high-resolution experimental data to predict kinetics and severity of infection in relation to variations in virus and host parameters. Our results suggest that the spleen represents a robust sink system for cytopathic virus infection able to cope with substantial variations of the IFN secretion and virus production in the spleen. However, the system is very fragile to minor increases in the virus growth rate in peripheral tissues.",

First, we decomposed the system dynamics into a set of 'elementary', well-documented processes such as the virus replication, target cell turnover and IFN-a decay, as well as the production of virus and IFN-a by infected cells ( Figure 1A ). This allowed us to estimate the individual decay rates, the virus-target cell interaction parameters and the protective effect of IFN-a. Once these elementary modules of virus-target cell interactions were calibrated, we used them as building blocks to set up an integrated mathematical model of pDC-mediated type I IFN responses against MHV infection in mice.",

            "text": "To estimate the kinetic parameters of MHV-pDC interaction, we used in vitro data on MHV infection of bone marrow-derived pDCs as described previously [8] . The data set characterizes the response of pDCs infection with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 ( Figure 2A ). To delineate a quantitative effect of IFN-a on virus production, additional data from similar experiments conducted with pDCs from mice deficient for the type I IFN receptor (ifnar 2/2 ) were used ( Figure 2B ). In addition to the MHV/IFN-a data, we considered data on survival kinetics of MHV-infected pDCs from wt and ifnar 2/2 mice generated independently in a separate series of experiments. The MHV-pDC interaction parameters appearing in the basic model of the type I IFN response (described in Materials and Methods) were estimated by fitting simultaneously the data sets on wt and ifnar 2/2 cells. The maximum likelihood approach for the log-transformed data was used to quantify the model parameters with the resulting best-fit description of the data by the model shown in Figure 2A and 2B. The resulting calibrated model for the in vitro pDC response to MHV was further validated by comparing its predictions with in vitro infection at an MOI of 0.1 and 0.01 ( Figure S1 ) and also, by determining the fraction of infected cells deduced from experimental data sets using an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expressing recombinant MHV [10] (Figure 2A and B). The parameter values summarized in Table 1 provide additional insight into the 'numbers game' between the virus and pDCs: (i) the average MHV secretion rate of infected pDCs is rather low with ,1.7 pfu cell 21 h 21 , (ii) the IFN-a level required for 2-fold inhibition of MHV production is about 46 pg/ml, (iii) the average secretion rate of IFNa per infected pDC is ,4.4*10 24 pg h 21 or, equivalently, ,15586 molecules h 21 . The latter estimate takes into account that the molecular weight of IFN-a is about 17000 atomic mass units (a.u.) and 1 a.u. = 1.67610 224 g.",

The initial innate immune responses to such viruses have to restrict virus spread before the adaptive immune responses fully develop. Therefore, it is of fundamental practical importance to understand the robustness and fragility of the early protection against such virus infections mediated by the type I interferon (IFN) response. Because of the inherent complexity of the virus-host system, we have used mathematical modeling to predict the sensitivity of the kinetics and severity of infection to variations in virus and host parameters. Our results suggest that the spleen represents a robust sink system for systemic virus infection and that this system is able to cope with substantial variations in IFN secretion and virus production. However, the system is very fragile to only minor increases in the virus growth rate in peripheral tissues. Collectively, the mathematical approach described in this study allows us to identify the most robust virus and host parameters during early cytopathic virus infection and can serve as a paradigm for systems immunology analyses of multiscale virus-host interaction of many life-threatening cytopathic virus infections.",

            "text": "To this end, we first determined the cellular composition of spleen in terms of pDC and Mw population sizes during early MHV infection. At the beginning of infection with 5610 3 pfu, the geometric means for pDCs and Mws were 6.6610 5 cells and 5.2610 6 cells, respectively (relative variation ,10%), and increased about two-fold by 36 hours following infection. Here, we considered intermediate values, i.e. the ones observed 18 hours post infection, so that 7610 5 pDCs and 6610 6 Mws were used to model the infection dynamics in spleen. To evaluate the qualitative consistency of the in vitro parameter estimates with the actually observed phenotype of MHV infection in vivo, we modeled the infections of the mixture of the above numbers of pDCs and Mws with increasing virus doses (5610 1 , 5610 3 , 5610 5 pfu). As shown in Figure S4 , the model consistently predicts that the virus growth is robustly controlled and that the extent of the activation of the type I IFN response depends on the virus kinetics. To set up the mathematical model for systemic MHV infection in mice, we proceeded in stages. First, we estimated the virus transfer rates between blood, spleen and liver together with the rate of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase using the compartmental model described in the Materials and Methods section, equations (5)- (8) . A reference data set characterizing the MHV growth in spleen, blood and liver and serum ALT kinetics after intravenous (i.v.) infection with 5610 3 pfu and 5610 5 pfu as shown in Figure 3A -D was used. Next, we integrated the description of MHV infection in spleen (given by equations (9)) with virus compartmental dynamics in the liver and blood to formulate the systemic model of MHV infection specified by the set of delay-differential equations (6)- (9) . It is most likely that both the splenic microarchitecture and the trafficking of the virus between organ compartments have an effect on the kinetics of MHV infection of splenic target cells as compared to the in vitro system. The compartmental model parameters listed in Table 2 were estimated via the maximum likelihood approach constrained by a detailed description of MHV interaction with the populations of pDCs and Mws in spleen. To accommodate for the observed differences between the in vitro and in vivo systems, we set out to refine some of the spleen model parameters to accurately describe the systemic virus data ( Figure 3 ). The number of reliably identifiable parameters in the mathematical model is limited by the amount and quality of the corresponding sets of experimental data which are available. To move from in vitro to in vivo MHV infection the following considerations were taken into account. First, the morphology of spleen is drastically different from the in vitro cell suspensions, which directly implies that the rate of target cell infection might differ. The second factor is the spatial location of Mws versus pDCs in spleen. Finally, the number of Mws in spleen is about 10-fold larger than the pDC population, so that the in vitro estimated infection rate of Mws would lead to an overwhelming virus growth in spleen before enough pDCs get activated to produce a protective amount of type I IFN. Therefore, the kinetics of Mw infection in spleen has been considered in the first instance. The above reasoning in conjunction with the parsimony principle and numerous trials to fit the in vivo data with different selections of adjusted parameters led us to conclude that a minimal set of three parameters ensured a consistent fitting of the vivo infection data: the infection rate s V (reduced by 60-fold), the 50% inhibition threshold h (increased by 10-fold) and the IFN secretion rate r I (reduced by 3 fold) for Mws (Table 1) . Taken together, the stepwise developed mathematical model, comprised of calibrated, refined and validated elementary modules, tightly fits the observed in vivo kinetics of MHV infection, and thus, provides a quantitative computational tool to assess the sensitivity of MHV infection dynamics to variations in the basic parameters of virus-host interactions.",

            "text": "As a first step in the analytical modeling process, we examined the effect of pDC numbers and activation status on the protection of Mws in spleen and the prevention of severe liver disease. As readout, i.e. the prediction of pDC performance criteria, we considered the maximum fraction of infected Mws in spleen and the peak level of serum ALT during the first 48 hours post i.v. infection with various doses of MHV. As shown in Figure 4A , the decrease of the pDC population in spleen by 10-fold results in increased virus titers but still keeps virus growth under control. However, further depletion of pDCs leads to an overwhelming virus growth. Mws in spleen represent about a 10-fold larger population of cells able to secrete MHV at a rate that is 10-times higher than pDCs. Therefore, protection of Mws against the infection represents an important task that pDCs have to ensure. Indeed, antibody-mediated depletion of pDCs considerably increased infection of splenic Mws ( Figure S5 ). Figure 4B (left panel) shows the quantitative model predictions of how the fraction of infected Mws in spleen depends on the number of pDCs and the dose of infection. Ten-fold reduction of pDCs in spleen still ensures that more than 90% of Mws remain uninfected for low to intermediate infection doses. However, a further decrease of the pDC population breaks their ability to keep the number of infected Mws below 10%. Because there is an inherent delay in activation of pDCs before the type I IFN secretion starts, we modeled the situation when a certain fraction of splenic pDCs is pre-activated at the start of the infection. Figure 4C (left panel) shows the predicted dependence of the infected Mws on the number of preactivated pDCs for MHV infection with 50 pfu. The results allowed us to quantify the upper limit for the protective capacity (PtC Mw ) of pDCs, if we define it as the ability to protect 90% of Mws against infection. As few as 2000 activated pDCs suffice to protect 6610 6 Mws, which leads to the estimate of PtC z Mw *3000 Mw per pDC. To clarify how the pDCs in spleen contribute to control against severe disease, we evaluated the peak ALT level for i.v. infections with different MHV doses and different pDC numbers ( Figure 4B , right panel). If we define the ALT threshold for protection against severe disease to be 10 3 IU/L, then the host is protected against infection with physiological doses when the number of pDCs in spleen is unchanged (7610 5 ) or 10-fold reduced. The protection is lost if spleen contains only 7610 3 pDCs and the dose of infection is larger than 100 pfu. This suggests that the protection unit of pDCs (PtU ALT ) required to prevent severe disease after low dose infection is around 7610 3 pDCs. Preactivation of pDCs leads to a more efficient control of the infection-associated disease as shown in Figure 4C (right panel). The reduction in the total number of non-activated splenic pDCs strongly affects the severity of disease. However, rather modest pre-activation of as few as 200 pDCs leads to a reduction of peak ALT below the threshold of severe disease (PtU z ALT *2|10 2 ). SLOs function to protect again severe disease by eliminating the virus from the system. To examine how the sink function of spleen depends on the availability of pDCs, we calculated the ratio of the number of viruses produced locally in spleen versus virus eliminated via trapping by target cells. The results summarized in Figure 4D show that the capacity of the spleen to eliminate the virus depends on the number of pDCs. Furthermore, the extent of the sink function depends on the dose of infection, i.e. high dose infection leads to a full activation of the capacity of spleen to work ",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved various mechanisms to reduce the efficacy of innate immune mechanisms [14] . Therefore, we examined a situation of virus-mediated inhibition of type I IFN synthesis by pDCs. Figure 5A shows the overall kinetics of the virus in spleen and liver together with serum ALT level after low-, intermediateand high dose i.v. infections of hosts with either normal IFN secretion rate r pDC I~4 :4|10 {4 pg cell 21 h 21 , or 10-to 100-fold reduction. Reduced IFN production by pDCs has a stronger impact on virus kinetics in spleen ( Figure 5A , upper row) but leads to minor perturbations of virus growth in the liver ( Figure 5A , middle row), or ALT levels in serum ( Figure 5A , bottom row). To quantitatively estimate the robustness of the pDC-mediated protection for spleen and liver we examined at a higher resolution the effect of reduced IFN synthesis on the peak viral load with infection doses ranging from 5 to 5610 4 pfu. Figure 5B shows that the spleen is well-protected, i.e. the peak virus titer stays below 10 5 pfu/ml. However, once the IFN secretion rate is reduced by 100fold, the virus infection is out of control as manifested by maximum titers of ,10 7 pfu/ml for all doses. In contrast to the spleen, the peak virus titer in the liver increases with higher virus doses and reduced type I IFN secretion rates ( Figure 5C ). Likewise, the severity of disease, characterized by the peak ALT levels, depends on the dose of infection and the IFN secretion rate by pDCs in a way similar to the virus titer in liver ( Figure 5D ). If we define a severe disease by ALT levels above 10 3 IU/L, then 7610 5 pDCs in spleen keep the host protected during the first two days of infection with virus doses up to 500 pfu even when the IFN secretion rate drops down to 1% of its normal value.",

A recently published study on cytopathic influenza A virus infection [15] provides quantitative details of the scale of virulence-enhancing mutations and the resulting increase in virus growth rate. It follows from the analysis of these virus growth data that the difference in the intrinsic growth rate is about 30%. With this estimate as a reference value, we used the mathematical model of MHV infection to evaluate the limits of protection against severe disease for increasing virus replication rates. Since various MHV strains display significant differences in their ability to replicate in different organ systems [17] , two complementary scenarios were considered: the increase in virus growth rate in the peripheral organs (liver) versus SLOs (spleen). Figure 6A shows that pDCs in spleen provide very limited protection against severe disease for faster replicating strains of the virus. Indeed, only a 15% increase in the growth rate of MHV in the liver leads to infection with ALT levels rising to 10 3 IU/L within two days. The decrease of pDC numbers in spleen makes the situation more fragile to even smaller increases in the virus growth rate. The contour lines shown in Figure 6A are the curves along which the value of ALT in serum at 48 h post infection remains the constant. The quantitative analysis of the contour lines slope suggests that 1% increase in the replication rate of the virus in the liver requires about 50% increase in the initial pDCs number in the spleen for the ALT level to have the same particular value. On the contrary, pDCs provide a robust protection against severe disease when the virulenceenhancing mutation leads to faster replication only in target cells located in spleen ( Figure 6B ), i.e. splenic pDCs protect against severe disease for up to 30-fold increase in the viral replication rate in splenic Mws. Taken together, these analyses indicate that the spleen represents a robust sink system able to cope with substantially enhanced virus production as long as this gain of viral fitness remains restricted to this SLO.",

            "text": "An important hallmark of the innate immune response during cytopathic virus infection is the ability of Mws to contain viral particles in SLOs. For example, Mws in the marginal sinuses of lymph nodes, capture viral particles from the incoming lymph stream [18] , and marginal zone Mws in spleen bind viruses decorated by complement and natural antibodies and reduce thereby dissemination of viruses to peripheral organs [19] . Coronaviruses can suppress early type I IFN responses in particular cell types including Mws [14, 20] , thus leaving these cells vulnerable to the cytopathic effects of the viral infection. Such blocking of innate type I IFN induction has not been observed for MHV and SARS coronavirus infection of mouse and human pDCs, respectively [8] . Likewise, human pDCs seem not to be sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the potent IFN antagonist NS1 of influenza virus [21] . Hence, pDCs are not only specialized for immediate viral recognition and type I IFN production through TLR-7 and -9 expression and the constitutive expression of IRF-7 [5] , they probably also exhibit unique counter-measures against viral IFN inhibitors. The interplay between pDCs and Mws is thus a critical cellular axis for the preservation of SLO integrity during early cytopathic virus infection. The systems immunology approach presented in this study provides a better understanding of the robustness and fragility of the pDC-mediated protection of Mws and eventually, the host against cytopathic virus infection. We implemented a genuine systems methodology using a building block approach in which the elementary 'modules of response' were calibrated using in vitro data. In addition, in vivo observations were used to further estimate essential parameters which combine the modules in a 'closed' system. A key to the development of this predictive mechanism-based modular mathematical model were model-driven experimental studies which provided comprehensive data sets for an accurate and reliable quantification of model parameters and validation of the model predictions. Using this approach, we identified the limits of the spleen's capability to function as a sink for the virus produced in a peripheral target organ. The robust sink function of the spleen is guaranteed by the high protective capacity of single pDCs which protect 10 3 to 10 4 Mws from cytopathic viral infection. Furthermore, we determined the minimal protective unit of pre-activated pDCs in spleen to be around 200 cells which can rescue the host from severe disease. The presented results suggest that the splenic sink function remains operational as long as viral mutations do not permit accelerated growth in peripheral tissues. Our model suggests that maintaining the sink function of SLOs is one of the major functions of pDCs. This notion is supported by findings on the life cycle of pDCs, namely that after development in the bone marrow, pDCs cells enter the blood circulation, and subsequently home to SLOs [22] [23] [24] [25] . The rapid accumulation of pDCs in lymph nodes following exposition to inflammatory stimuli [26, 27] further corroborates that SLOs are -at least in the very early phase of an infection -the most important compartment of pDC activity. Potential effects of pDCs migrating to non-lymphoid organs such as the liver in later stages of an infection have not been considered in our model. It will be interesting to incorporate data on pDC populations accumulating in peripheral organs during the later phases of MHV infection in future modeling approaches. Likewise, it will be important to address the potential functions of pDCs in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses [4] in the terms of systems immunology. A combination of the present mathematical framework with, for example, novel experimental models of pDCdeficiency [28, 29] will open new avenues to describe the dynamical aspects of such multiscale interactions. Furthermore, the presented combination of experimental studies and mathematical modeling may be used to further explore the contribution of virus-encoded factors modulating tumor necrosis factor-enhanced liver inflammation [30] or the role of important host factors such as the prothrombinase Fgl2/ fibroleukin which critically regulate virus-induced liver disease [31] .",

This inspired a turn in basic and applied immunology from reductionist dissection to systems integration with mathematical modeling being an essential tool [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, the translation of the powerful modeling methodologies developed in applied mathematics, such as the mathematical systems theory and computational techniques into research tools appropriate for a multiscale analysis of immunological phenomena remains a challenge [1, 36, 37] . Indeed, recent reviews on the application of mathematical analyses in immunology indicate that progress has mainly been made in those studies which model the immune processes at a single resolution level, rather than bridge multiple scales of description [1, [38] [39] [40] . The within-host population dynamics of antigen-specific immune responses and pathogens and the single cell regulation of lymphocyte activation represent the two most advanced fields. Compared to antigen-specific responses, the development of mathematical models for the description and analysis of innate immune processes has remained a poorly investigated area [41] [42] [43] . Our study addresses the above two challenges of the integrative modeling of antiviral immune responses: (1) it bridges the cellcytokine-virus population dynamics level with the physiological function of the spleen in the host-pathogen interaction and (2) provides a high-resolution quantitative description of the early type I IFN response to cytopathic virus infection.",

The available data vary essentially in terms of the sample sizes, which is common for studies of virus and cell population dynamics. The most numerous data sets are the virus kinetics data. The corresponding samples followed a log-normal distribution.

This dependence is consistent with them entering together the virus production term in equation (1) of the basic module. The other implication is that the structure permits the other model parameters to be identified. The identifiability test of the compartmental model (equations [5] [6] [7] [8] suggests that it is identifiable, provided that the observable variables are the virus in spleen, blood and liver and the serum ALT blood, which is the current case. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis was performed which allowed to rank the influence of random variations in the model parameters on the variation in the serum ALT level. The methodology and the results are presented in Table S2 and the accompanying text.",
