Brain/CNS metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) is rare occurring in 3% of cases, and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is extremely rare in CRC (<0.02%). Symptoms and signs of LMC are pleomorphic and may be localized to three compartments: cerebral hemispheres, cranial nerves, and spinal cords and roots. Treatment of metastatic rectal cancer has been improving over the last few years with a lot of changes toward longer survival and improvement in quality of life and to change the disease into a chronic condition. However, in our case, the overall survival from the onset of LMC was 3 weeks only. Revising the evidence in the treatment of signet ring histology of rectal cancer, there is no specific treatment recommendation that is for this histology and for such very aggressive behavior which could be considered as a separate entity to the classic adenocarcinoma histology.",

They are prognostically unfavorable independent of the stage [3] . Compared with AC, colorectal SRCC tends to occur at younger age, to affect the right side, to be poorly differentiated, to recur more, and to have poor survival [5, 6] . They express mucin-related genes (HATH1, MUC2, and SOX2) and show disruption of the E-cadherin/ beta-catenin complex, amplification of Bcl-2 [6] , low K-ras, high BRAF mutations, and high MSI [7] . Loss of protein expression of E-cadherin may contribute to the high-grade and invasive nature of colorectal SRCC [7] . In the current case, the patient was young (42 years) and had anal/rectal lesion that is locally advanced (T3) associated with distant metastases. He ran a rapid grave course. Skeletal metastases (SKM) in CRC may reach up to 24% if radiotherapy or systemic therapies are not used [8] and to 5.5-11% when these therapies are used [9] [10] [11] . Isolated SKM is rare, occurring in 1-2% of CRC [8] . It is usually associated with liver or lung metastases [8, 9] . SKM is more in younger patients, in rectum and caecum primarily, and in SRCC [8] [9] [10] . CRC SKM affects the vertebral column in 65%, hip/pelvis in 34%, long bones in 26%, and other bones in 17% [10] . SKM usually presents with bone pains or pathological fractures [12] . Time from CRC diagnosis to onset of SKM ranges from 10 to >5000 days with a median of 11 months [10] . Skeletal scintigraphy detects SKM with high sensitivity. Palin X-rays are helpful in symptomatic lesions and in assessing fracture risk or questionable scintigraphic findings. CT is helpful when other imaging techniques are unclear. Whole-body MRI and PET-CT are the most sensitive and specific methods for the detection of SKM. Hybrid techniques like SPECT-CT, PET-CT, and PET-MRI combine the strengths of their different components and avoid the weaknesses [13] . Traditional treatments for SKM include radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy [14] . Both denosumab and zoledronic acid reduce pains and skeletal morbidities in patients with SKM [12, 15] . In 5 years, 38% of patients isolated SKM are alive compared to 16% when other metastases coexist [11] . The median survival is 5-7 months [10, 16] . In the current case, SKM was the initial site of metastasis and developed 4 months following initial diagnosis. It presented with bone pains and tenderness and confirmed by bone scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. He received palliative RT, zoledronic acid, and systemic chemotherapy with mild improvement. The overall survival from the onset of SKM was 5 months.",

            "text": "Bone marrow metastasis (BMM) was noticed at necropsy in 93/1541 CRC patients (11.6%) where chemotherapy was rarely used. It is extremely rare (<1%) in the absence of liver and lung metastases and increases to 3% with both liver and lung metastases [17] . The most common metastatic site associated with BMM from solid tumors is the bone in 70% of cases followed by liver (14%), brain (10%), and lung (10%) metastases [18] . Early features of BMM include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and leukoerythroblastosis in 70% of cases. Clinically, patients present with anemia in 68%, thrombocytopenia in 58%, and neutropenia in 23%. Bicytopenia is encountered in 32% and pancytopenia in 18%. About 15% of cases had no hematological findings and were suspected based on imaging only [18, 19] . Using modern techniques, malignant cells were found in BM in 21% of patients with stages I-III at the time of curative surgery [20] . However, the clinical relevance of micrometastasis in BM is to be validated. Mostly, its value may be limited unless supported by some other clinical findings, such as a leukoerythroblastic reaction or abnormal peripheral blood counts [21] . Despite BM biopsy is the surest and fastest method of diagnosis, MRI and FDG PET or PET/CT are very sensitive in the detection of BMM [21, 22] .",

            "text": "BMM from CRC is primarily treated by chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. Agents most commonly used are fluoropyrimidines (5-FU, S1) and oxaliplatin and occasionally bevacizumab. These lead to clinical improvements in many patients [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Cytopenias secondary to BMM not only increase the risk of infection and bleeding but also hinder the delivery of effective chemotherapy [18] . BMM usually carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of 5-7 months [29] . Performance status, other metastatic sites, and platelet counts are important prognosticators. Survival of patients with thrombocytopenia is shorter than with normal platelet counts (1 month vs. 13 months) [18] . Brain/CNS metastasis from CRC is rare occurring in 3% of cases [10] . Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is extremely rare in CRC (<0.02%) [30] . It is rarely the sole site of intracranial disease [31] . Symptoms and signs of LMC are pleomorphic and may be localized to three compartments: cerebral hemispheres, cranial nerves, and spinal cords and roots. Headache, diplopia, and back/neck pain are common. CSF cytology is the gold standard in LMC diagnosis. Although CSF cytology has 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity, it has a low negative predictive value. CT scans are abnormal in 25-56% of cases with LMC. However, contrast-enhanced MRI has higher sensitivity (59%) and specificity (95%) [32] . Without treatment, the median survival of patients with LMC is 4-8 weeks. Patients usually die of progressive leptomeningeal or systemic cancer [30, 32, 33] . Bulky leptomeningeal disease, concurrent CNS disease, epidural cord compression, and poor performance status are poor prognostic factors [32] . Intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy may be used with limited efficacy [34] . In the current case, LMC was suspected clinically based on the neurological findings (diplopia and squint) and MRI. However, the concomitant mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinus raised the issue of secondary meningitis. However, the lack of response to a multitude of antimicrobials was going with LMC. The overall survival from the onset of LMC was 3 weeks.",
