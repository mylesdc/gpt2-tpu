A total of 34 sodium counter ions were added to neutralize the pseudoknot. The system was solvated in a box of TIP3P water. The water box (containing 63946 water molecules) was made sufficiently large (10 nm \u00d7 8 nm \u00d7 8 nm) to prevent the unfolded RNA encountering its periodic image. Periodic boundary conditions were used and the Particle mesh Ewald method (PME) method 15 was implemented to calculate the electrostatic interactions. The energy of van der Waals non-bonded interactions was evaluated using a 10 \u00c5 cutoff. The LINCS algorithm was applied to the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The system was subjected to energy minimization to optimize the initial geometry. The standard molecular mechanics steepest decent algorithm was used. A short 100 ps equilibration with position restraints on all atom was conducted after the energy minimization.",

[20] [21] [22] All of the simulations were carried out using the Gromacs program with the AMBER-99SB force field. 14,23 Sodium ions and chloride ions with a final concentration of 200 mM were added using the Gromacs program tool. 24 The system was solvated in a box of TIP3P water. 25 To accommodate the completely stretched pseudoknot, the water box (containing 70,800 water molecules) is asymmetric with the dimensions of 60 nm \u00d7 6 nm \u00d7 6 nm. Periodic boundary conditions were used and the PME 15 was implemented to calculate electrostatic interactions. The energy of van der Waals non-bonded interactions were evaluated using a 14 \u00c5 cutoff. The LINCS algorithm was applied to the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. 26 The starting structure for the SMD simulation was the same as in the REMD simulations. The system was equilibrated for 1 ns with only the position restraint on the O5' atom of the 5' terminal G residue at 295 K. The equilibrium and SMD simulation were all performed in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble with a fixed temperature of 295 K and a pressure of 1 atm.",

            "text": "A standard SMD protocol was used to stretch the pseudoknot, similar to the works of White et al. 28 The standard deviations are about 10% of the mean values. K (panel b) , the single distribution peak is close to the native structure with around 16 and 18 hydrogen bonds for stem 2 and stem 1, respectively. At 390 K (panel c), the major distribution peak is still around 16 and 18 H-bonds for stem 2 and stem 1, respectively. However, the minor populations of non-native structures of both stems appear at 390 K. Between 408 and 461 K (panels d-g) , the distribution at zero Hbond of stem 2 gradually becomes the major peak. At temperatures between 481 and 512 K (panels h-i), a new distribution peak with zero H-bond in stem 1 emerges and gradually becomes the major peak. Figure S3 . Free energy plots and structural snapshots obtained from the REMD simulations for SF206. The structural snapshots demonstrate that upon increasing the temperature, stem 2 melts before stem 1. The two-dimensional free energy plot is shown on the left side of each panel. The two reaction coordinates are the numbers of base-base H-bonds formed within stem 1 and stem 2, respectively. The color scheme illustrates the free energy values at 300 K obtained from Boltzmann inversion of the simulation population distributions of H-bonds. Shown on the right side of each panel is the structural snapshot from a selected region marked by a pink cycle in the corresponding free energy plot. Panel a shows the native state. The structural snapshots shown in panels b-e are the intermediate state with stem 2 completed disrupted and stem 1 intact, which becomes an energetically favourable and most populated state at 449 K (see panel e). Stem 1 starts to unfold upon further increasing temperature (panel f), and the state with both stems unfolded becomes dominant at 481 K (panel g). At 512 K, the structure is completely unfolded (panel h). Figure S4 . Representative force-ramp traces. The force (un)loading rate is at about 11 pN/s except for panels a (~ 5 pN/s) and c (~20 pN/s). The data acquisition rate is 100 Hz, except for panels i and j (1000 Hz). Typically a one-step unfolding transition is observed. A rarely observed two-step unfolding trace is shown in panel j. The vertical black arrow in panel j indicates the presence of an unfolding intermediate state. Figure S5 . Rupture force versus extension change of one-step unfolding transitions obtained from force-ramp experiment. The predicted EWLC curves are shown for the pseudoknot to single strand transition. The end-to-end distance of the pseudoknot (4 nm) is taken into consideration. The letters S, H and P represent ssRNA, hairpin and pseudoknot, respectively. At a relatively high force (18 pN), the hairpin structure has a rapid exchange with the singlestranded conformation. The pseudoknot structure is stabilized upon lowering the force to 16-17 pN, and unfolds into the dynamic ensemble of single-stranded and hairpin conformations. At a relatively low force (15 pN), the pseudoknot conformation is further stabilized, and rarely unfolds into the hairpin conformation. Consistently, in the force-ramp experiment, the two-step and one-step unfolding forces for SF217 are in the range of 15-20 pN and > 20 pN, respectively. Thus, the constant-force and force-ramp data of S217 suggest that the energy barrier of pseudoknot to hairpin transitions is higher and stiffer than that of hairpin to pseudoknot. 29 (b) Histograms of extensions in panel a. Extensions were binned to 1 nm. The histograms were fitted using Gaussian functions. Figure S7 . Representative constant-force traces observed for SF348. The 1000 Hz data (cyan) were subsampled to 20 Hz (blue). The letters S, H and P represent ssRNA, hairpin and pseudoknot, respectively. (a) Representative force-jump cycles for pseudoknot SF348 with a zoom-in view for the boxed regions shown in panels b and c. (b) A one-step unfolding transition at 25 pN. (c) As the extension change between intermediate state and pseudoknot sate is very small for SF348, we did not observe the transition directly. However, the refolding trace of SF348 shows similar folding dynamics as that of SF206 (Fig. 4d) and SF217 (Supplementary Fig.  S6 ), i.e., before the pseudoknot conformation forms stably, fast hopping between ssRNA and hairpin intermediate is observed for a few seconds as the force is dropped to 17.0 pN. Figure S8 . One-step rupture force distributions for pseudoknots from force-ramp experiment. The red lines are plotted using parameters from linear fitting in Supplementary Fig. S9 . Figure S9 . Force-dependent unfolding rates extracted from rupture force distributions obtained from force-ramp experiment using Dudko's method. 1 Errors for the unfolding rates are calculated based on Poisson noise. The Bell model was applied to extract the unfolding rates at zero force or other forces ( Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. S10 ) and unfolding transition state positions. Errors of lnk are reported as standard errors. Figure S10 . Previously measured in vitro frameshifting efficiency 28 versus unfolding rate, lnk, at varied forces obtained from force-ramp experiment. The plots for 0, 25, and 40 pN are shown in Fig. 7 . Linear fitting was applied for each plot. Error bars of frameshifting efficiency represent standard deviations. Errors of lnk are reported as standard errors.",

The two dimensional free energy plots were calculated from the Boltzmann inversion formula \u2206 using the hydrogen bond (H-bond) numbers of stem 1 and stem 2 as two reaction coordinates. Here, R is the gas constant, and T is 300 K. The density \u03c1 is the conformational distribution density for a grid defined by two H-bond numbers, and \u03c10 is the corresponding normalization term calculated from an idea gas distribution. Free energy values were computed for the grids of the two reaction coordinates, where zero H-bond number means the complete unfolding of the stem and the fully folded structure corresponds to the maximum H-bond number.",

The spring constant was 4152.5 pN/nm. The pulling speed was 1 nm/ns, which resulted in a total simulation time of 24 ns to unfold the pseudoknot. We aligned the pseudoknot to make sure that the straight line between the O3' atom of 3' terminal residue A and the O5' atom of the 5' terminal residue G is parallel to the X axis. The direction of pulling was along the X axis of the simulation box. The O5' atom of the 5' terminal residue G was fixed (by a position restraint with spring constant 1661 pN/nm in X/Y/Z directions) throughout the SMD simulations. The simulated pulling forces were calculated every 2 fs. A total of ten simulations were performed for SF206. The numbers of H-bonds were calculated every 4 ps. The corresponding curves were smoothed by computing the averages for 80 equally spaced intervals, with the bin width ~0.3 ns (or ~0.3 nm of extension) for each simulation. The means of the intervals were used to plot the simulated profiles using natural cubic splines.",
