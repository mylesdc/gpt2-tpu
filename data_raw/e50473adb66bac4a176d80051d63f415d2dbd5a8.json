            "text": "Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly infectious fatal pig disease, resulting in huge economic loss to the swine industry. Integrins are membrane-bound signal mediators, expressed on a variety of cell surfaces and are known as receptors or coreceptors for many viruses. However, the role of integrin b3 in CSFV infection is unknown. Here, through quantitive PCR, immunofluorescence (IFC) and immunocytohistochemistry (ICC), we revealed that ST (swine testicles epithelial) cells have a prominent advantage in CSFV proliferation as compared to EC (swine umbilical vein endothelial cell), IEC (swine intestinal epithelial cell) and PK (porcine kidney epithelial) cells. Meanwhile, ST cells had remarkably more integrin b3 expression as compared to EC, IEC and PK cells, which was positively correlated with CSFV infection and proliferation. Integrin b3 was upregulated post CSFV infection in all the four cell lines, while the CSFV proliferation rate was decreased in integrin b3 function-blocked cells. ShRNA1755 dramatically decreased integrin b3, with a deficiency of 96% at the mRNA level and 80% at the protein level. CSFV proliferation was dramatically reduced in integrin b3 constantly-defected cells (ICDC), with the deficiencies of 92.6%, 99% and 81.7% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post CSFV infection, respectively. These results demonstrate that integrin b3 is required in CSFV infection and proliferation, which provide a new insight into the mechanism of CSFV infection.",

CSFV leads to huge economic loss in the swine industry as CSF causes problems characterized by high fever, alternating constipation, diarrhea and high mortality [1, 2] . Transmission of this virus mainly depends on contact spread, but recent investigations indicated that infected boars could transmit CSFV in semen as well [3, 4] . This disease was first identified in USA during a continuous major nationwide epizootics, and was subsequently found in many other countries [5, 6] . The last major CSF epidemic in European Union occurred mainly in Netherlands and to a lesser extent in Germany, Italy, Belgium and Spain [7, 8] . Considering its rapid speed in spreading across national borders, and the huge socio-economic damage to the porcine industry, CSF was classified as a notifiable disease by OIE [9] .",

Glycoprotein E (gpE), presented on the flaviviral particle surface has a conservative spatial structure [11] . It is thought to interact with cell surface receptors during the early stage of virus infection. Research done by Bogachek, demonstrated that the gpE domain III from WNV interacts with integrin avb3 at an initial stage of entry into the host cells [12] .

            "text": "Integrins are heterodimeric trans-membrane adhesion molecules comprising a family of non-covalently linked 18 a and 8 b subunits [13] [14] [15] . It is also known that integrins play various roles in cell adhesion, migration, embryonic development, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, immune responses and wound healing [16, 17] . Specifically, integrin b3, which is present on a variety of cell surfaces, is one of the most important cell receptors. Integrin b3 mediates extracellular signals by recognizing and delivering different molecules into cells, resulting in changes in calcium, Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) and PI-3K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) activity [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The activation and communication between PI-3K and internal calcium are crucial for integrin outside-in signaling. More importantly, integrin b3 is known to be a receptor or co-receptor for many viruses, such as Rotavirus [27] [28] [29] [30] , Hantavirus [31] [32] [33] , and Foot-and-mouth disease virus [34, 35] . It also plays a key role in infection processes of Adenovirus [36, 37] , West Nile Virus [32] , Human immunodeficiency virus [38, 39] , Human Parecho virus [40] [41] [42] , and Herpes simplex virus type 1 [43] [44] [45] . Furthermore, previous studies from our laboratory have shown that integrin b3 is up-regulated in endothelial cells post CSFV infection (post CSFV infection = p.i.) [46] .",

Functional-blocking or shRNA-mediated depletion of integrin b3 in EC cells dramatically decreased the rate of CSFV proliferation. This study also adds another receptor-function of integrin b3 and provides the first insight of a promising active receptor for CSFV infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that targeted inhibition or depletion of integrin b3 could be a potential therapeutic treatment for CSFV infection.",

Fig. 1C shows the calculated amount of CSFV virions in cell-culture liquid from different cell lines at different time points (24 h, 48 h or 72 h) post CSFV challenge. CSFV proliferation amount in cell-culture liquid from ST cells was the highest and continually increased from 24 h to 72 h (Fig. 1C) , indicating that CSFV virions secreted from ST cells were much more than that from the other three cell lines. In addition, the amount of CSFV virions secreted to cell-culture liquid had a generally increasing trend from 24 h to 72 h in all the four cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1D , the amount of CSFV proliferated in ST cells was much more than that in the other three cell lines. Specifically, the feature of CSFV proliferation was different in different cell lines from 24 h to 72 h p.i. In ST cells, CSFV reached its peak value at 48 h p.i., while it took 72 h for the other three cell lines to reach their peak values. This result suggests that EC, IEC, PK cells have a lower ability in secreting CSFV virions to extracellular matrix than ST cells do (Fig. 1C and 1D ).",

Specifically, the result of Fig. 3C showed that ST cells and IEC cells exhibited the highest amounts of integrin b3 mRNA at 72 h p.i., while EC cells and PK cells reached peak amounts of integrin b3 mRNA at 24 h p.i.

By contrast, EC cells increased in number from 12 h to 72 h with peak amounts observed at 72 h. Interestingly, ST cells that have a predominant advantage in CSFV proliferation also had the lowest cell replication rate ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ).

(Fig. 7E) , respectively, as compared to the nc group (nc stands for the ICDC without CSFV infection). This result is consistent with the integrin b3 functional blocking assay, thereby confirming that a cellular reduction of integrin b3 amount decreases the rate of CSFV proliferation.

In this study, we document that integrin b3, a membrane-bound signal mediator, is required for CSFV infection and proliferation. CSFV proliferates very efficiently in ST cells ( Fig. 1 and 2) , which was positively correlated with the high amount of integrin b3 in these cells (Fig. 3 ). In addition, the amount of CSFV proliferation decreased in integrin b3-funtionally blocked cells (Fig. 5 ) as well as in integrin b3-deficient cells (Fig. 7) . Collectively, our results strongly imply that integrin b3 plays a critical role in CSFV infection and proliferation, presumably by modulating CSFV adherence and emergence from host cells.",

Many reports revealed that viruses from Flaviviradea family use integrin b3 as a receptor or co-receptor during the infection stage [27, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . For example, acute CSF shares a high level of similarity with Dengue virus (DV) [2, 59] that causes classical dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [53] . It has been demonstrated that integrin b3 is required for DV type2 to enter vascular endothelial cells, and that integrin b3 is up-regulated during DV infection [59, 60] . Similarly, we found that integrin b3 was up-regulated in all four swine cell lines (EC, IEC, PK and ST) during CSFV infection (Fig. 3C) , which is in line with previous research of Tang, etc. [46] . ST cells possessing high amount of integrin b3, also show high susceptibility to CSFV infection. Many other studies have also reported that integrin b3 is a receptor for foot-and-mouth disease virus [54] [55] [56] , coxackievirus A9 [51] , echovirus 9 [52] and rotavirus [27, 30, 61] . In addition, adenovirus-mediated gene delivery to intestinal epithelium relies on, or is enhanced by the presence of integrin avb3 [62, 63] .",

Y-axis denotes the normalized amount of proliferated CSFV assessed by two-step qPCR while X-axis denotes different b3 integrin b3 is important for Hantavirus infection, whereas integrin av showed less effect than integrin b3 does in vivo. Neff, etc. [65] demonstrated that the bovine integrin b3 subunit was responsible for the receptor-function of integrin in FMDV infection, while av subunit was not equally required as b3 subunit. Based on these prior reports, we focused on the role of integrin b3 in CSFV infection. Even though it is yet to be established why CSFV targets integrin b3, Bensaude, etc. have demonstrated that CSFV inhibits apoptosis of host cells, thus allowing the establishment of longterm infection and proliferation [66] . Integrin is responsible for cell adhesion, so its depletion would lead to loss of adhesion and subsequent apoptosis. The results from our study and Tang, etc. confirm that integrin b3 is up-regulated post CSFV infection. This suggests that CSFV infection results in the up-regulation of integrin so as to keep host cells in a condition that allows additional proliferation of virions.",

Erns and E2 is the glycoprotein expressed on the surface of virus envelope, inducing the immunity response of the host animal. Heparin sulfate (HS) was previously reported to be the receptor for Erns [67, 68] , but it was also demonstrated that there are other strains of CSFV not dependent on HS to infect host cells. This indicates that the receptor for E2, which has not yet been disclosed, is much more specific and important for CSFV infection. Bogachek [12] demonstrated that gpE from WNV recognizes integrin avb3 during the entry stage into the host cells.",
