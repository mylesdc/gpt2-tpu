Despite this progress, there are few mathematical models of within-host dengue dynamics, and the ones that exist focus primarily on the general role of immune cells in the clearance of infected cells, while neglecting other components of the immune response in limiting viraemia. Here, by considering a suite of mathematical within-host dengue models of increasing complexity, we aim to isolate the critical components of the innate and the adaptive immune response that suffice in the reproduction of several well-characterized features of primary and secondary dengue infections. By building up from a simple target cell limited model, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary symptomatic dengue infection, while a higher rate of viral infectivity (indicative of antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell clearance by T cells are further needed to recover the characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection. We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of these virological indicators to predict the onset of severe disease depends on the contribution of T cells in fuelling the cytokine storm.",

Experimental studies in mice have shown that the innate immune response is important for clearing a primary dengue infection, whereas the adaptive immune response contributes to the development of severe disease [3, 4] . Other studies have shown that human dengue antibodies can enhance viral growth in vitro and thereby increase the risk of developing severe disease in a secondary infection with a heterologous serotype [5, 6] . Further studies have shown that memory T-cells established during a primary infection may act to increase the risk of developing severe disease in a heterologous secondary infection through increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production [7, 8] . Complementing these experimental studies, epidemiological studies have successfully isolated host and viral risk factors associated with severe disease [9] [10] [11] [12] . Taken together, these studies have indicated that excessive activation of the immune response during a dengue infection may lead to a cascade of cytokine production, known as a cytokine storm, that results in direct damage to vascular endothelial cells and increased capillary permeability [7, 13, 14] . This cytokine storm phenomenon is not unique to dengue, having also been used to describe pathologies resulting from other viral infections including influenza, cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [13] .",

These models have in large part focused on chronic infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [15, 16] and hepatitis C virus [15, 17] . For diseases causing acute infection, influenza has been the most extensively studied pathogen to date, probably due to the availability of human and non-human animal challenge study data. These influenza models have highlighted the importance of both the innate and the adaptive immune response in regulating viral dynamics [18] [19] [20] [21] , and particularly, the role of the innate immune response in contributing to disease symptoms [20, 22] .",

Three of these models consider the dynamic interaction between free virus, uninfected target cells, infected target cells and immune cells [23] [24] [25] , differing from one another only in the functional forms used to model viral infectivity, viral clearance and immune cell dynamics. In all three of these models, the immune cells play a protective role by clearing infected cells and are therefore likely to represent T cells. None of these models considers the known effects that T cells and more generally, the adaptive immune response may have in contributing to dengue disease. Of note, one of these models [25] was statistically fit to individual-level patient data, with findings indicating that differences in viral dynamics between primary and secondary infections can be recovered by a higher viral infectivity rate during secondary infections. This result is consistent with evidence for the enhancement of viral infectivity as a result of increased levels of non-neutralizing antibodies during a secondary infection relative to a primary infection. The fourth model considers the dynamic interaction between free virus, uninfected cells, infected cells, B cells and antibodies [26] . In this model, the effect of antibodies is either protective or enhancing, depending on the antigenic similarity between the virus of the primary infection and the virus of the secondary infection. However, this model does not provide an explicit mechanism by which disease arises. Instead, it assumes that disease severity is positively correlated with the level of antibodies in a heterologous secondary infection. None of these existing dengue models consider the role that the innate immune response plays in controlling the viral infection or how infection dynamics explicitly impact disease severity.",

Our approach is thus to analyse models of increasing complexity, evaluating each model by the dynamic features it can yield. We begin with a simple target cell limited model, and in a step-wise fashion, consider the dynamical effects that the innate and the adaptive immune responses contribute to dengue infection dynamics. By first parametrizing the considered models for a primary symptomatic infection using a combination of literature estimates and clinical observations that serve as constraints on model parameters, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary infection. To arrive at a minimal model for a secondary dengue infection, we build up from the minimal primary infection model to recover the characteristic features of a secondary infection that differ from those of a primary infection. We find that higher viral infectivity rates along with infected cell clearance by T cells are necessary to reproduce these characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection, underscoring the contribution of the adaptive immune response in these infections.

Characteristic features of a primary dengue infection Viral kinetic data from dengue patients are often absent prior to fever onset (e.g. [9] [10] [11] 29] ). A comprehensive study of cytokines from human infections are similarly missing [30, 31] , or are taken at few or even only a single time point post-infection [32, 33] . Furthermore, there is considerable variation among studies in cytokine levels, potentially due to their relatively short half-lives [34] . Instead of evaluating different mathematical models directly by their fit to these incomplete (if at all available) data, we here first develop a minimal model for a primary dengue infection that is able to reproduce well-established characteristic features of the viral infection. For a primary dengue infection resulting in DF, these features are (i) target cells (monocytes [14] ) deplete to approximately 60% of their original level during dengue infection (from approx. 3.5 \u00c2 10 5 cells ml 21 to 2 \u00c2 10 5 cells ml 21 ) [12] ; (ii) peak viraemia occurs approximately 9 days post viral inoculation based on estimates of the incubation period [35] and the timing of peak viraemia after the onset of symptoms [9] ; (iii) maximum daily clearance rate is approximately 2.2 log 10 copies per millilitre per day [9] , and (iv) peak viraemia is approximately 9.7 log 10 copies per millilitre. The latter two features are measured from DENV-1 patients [9] , so may not perfectly reflect the characteristic features of dengue serotypes 2-4.",

Although the authors do not explicitly interpret their model as one that models the cellular immune response, their immune response formulation closely mirrors previous model descriptions of T cells [51] . Contrary to this assumption, an experimental study in mice has shown that T cells are not critical for clearance of dengue virus during primary infection [3] , though the relevance of mouse models in understanding human dengue infection has been questioned given the low replicative ability of dengue in mice. A study of T-cell responses in human primary dengue infections, however, appears to support the conclusions reached in the mouse study [52] : T cells are not activated in large quantities early in infection. Hence, T cells are unlikely to play a large role in clearing dengue virus in a primary infection.

This level and timing of peak viraemia is consistent with virological data from secondary DF and DHF patients [9] . This reparametrization can also be easily interpreted biologically in the context of a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which proposes that antibodies from a first infection cross-react with virus from a secondary infection, but lead to incomplete neutralization. The resulting partially neutralized immune complexes are thought to enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor bearing target cells, and, as a result of this increased viral infectivity, lead to higher viraemia [53, 54] . While an increased viral infectivity rate could reproduce shorter times to peak viraemia and higher levels of peak viraemia, this change could not reproduce a higher maximum viral clearance rate of at least 2.8 log 10 copies per millilitre per day.",

By assuming a lifespan of T cells of 10 days as in [50] and the same model parameters as for the primary infection model, with the exception of a 20% increase in b, the model retains only two free parameters: the T-cell recruitment rate q T and the rate at which T cells lyse infected cells d T . Figure 3 shows how these two parameter combinations affect the features of a secondary dengue infection. Both parameters have negligible effects on the peak viraemia value (figure 3a) and the time to peak viraemia (figure 3b), because T cells are not circulating at high levels before peak viraemia.

These data come from a clinical trial of adult dengue patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam [9] . Viraemia was measured in the blood twice a day following hospital arrival, which was within 72 h of reported symptom onset. Virus was quantified by RT-PCR. Assuming an incubation period between viral inoculation and onset of symptoms of 6 days [35] , figure 4 shows the viral load kinetics simulated using our minimal primary and secondary infection models under the parametrizations provided in table 1, along with data from both DF and DHF primary and secondary dengue infections. Though there is considerable variability in the observed data, the model simulations effectively capture their general dynamics. Furthermore, the data shown are consistent with the features described in \u00a72.1 and 2.4. The dengue viral load data contain both non-infectious and infectious viral particles [9] . However, we can consider only infectious virus in the model without impacting any of the other model variables by introducing a conversion factor that captures the ratio of all virus particles to infectious virus particles. By dividing the model parameter r by the conversion factor and multiplying the parameter b by this factor, the dynamics of the system remain unchanged, with the exception of the free virus dynamics. These dynamics are changed in that V is proportionally reduced by the magnitude of the factor at each time point, thereby modelling infectious virus particles instead of all virus particles.",

Vascular leakage, the hallmark of DHF, occurs around the time of defervescence and lasts for approximately 48 h [57] . During this period, levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 are consistently seen to be elevated in DHF patients compared to DF patients or healthy controls [57] [58] [59] [60] . TNF-a in particular has been shown to be correlated with disease severity in numerous studies [14, 31, 57, [61] [62] [63] [64] . Furthermore, human polymorphisms that predispose for high TNF-a production have been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to DHF [65] . IL-6 and IL-8 work synergistically with TNF-a to mediate activation of endothelial cells [14] .

            "text": "T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease [7, 66, 67] . Specifically, a theory known as original antigenic sin (OAS) proposes that memory T-cell populations with low avidity for the infecting virus of a heterologous secondary infection cause a strong pro-inflammatory response, as would any memory T-cell population activated by a secondary infection. Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor [7, 68] . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of dengue virus-specific T cells were of low affinity for the infecting serotype but had high affinity to one of the other three serotypes [68] . This study also showed that patients with DSS had stronger T-cell responses than individuals with less severe disease. In contrast to these pathologic effects of T cells, recent studies have suggested that T cells may instead play a protective role against severe disease [27, 28, 66] . Specifically, Weiskopf et al. showed that individuals with a strong T-cell response were associated with an HLA allele that appears to confer protection from severe disease [28] . They further showed that in transgenic mice, heterologous secondary infections responses directed to serotype-specific epitopes were impaired, but responses to conserved epitopes were not, suggesting that heterologous secondary infections are associated with a limited T-cell response [69] . Dung et al. [27] further documented a temporal mismatch between CD8 \u00fe T-cell activation and vascular leakage, suggesting that T-cell-secreted cytokines do not contribute to the development of severe disease.",

To determine whether the minimal models developed in the previous sections are able to reproduce the established relationships between these virological indicators of disease severity and the risk of developing severe disease, we used a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) approach [70, 71] . LHS is a random sampling method where uncertainty in each model parameter is considered in its contribution to a specified outcome, in our case, the risk of developing severe disease, which we take to be proportional to the peak level of endothelial activators E. We first performed LHS simulations by varying parameters of both the primary infection and the secondary infection models ( figure 5) . For a primary infection, we considered variation in the initial condition S(0), and the model parameters b, r, k, q N (q/d) and d N on the peak level of endothelial activators. For a secondary infection, we considered variation in these same parameters and initial conditions as well as in the initial condition T(0) and the T-cell parameters d T , q T and d T ( figure 5) . We used a sample size of 500 LHS simulations and sampled each parameter from a uniform distribution that extended +10% from the point estimates provided in table 1.",

In primary dengue infections, and in secondary dengue infections when disease severity is assumed to be due to only infected cell-secreted cytokines, the level of peak viraemia is almost a perfect predictor of disease severity (figure 5a). This is because increases in early acting parameters (S(0), b, r) all act to increase the number of infected cells, resulting in both higher peak viraemia and a higher maximum number of endothelial activators. Increases in late-acting parameters (k, q N (q/d), d N , T(0), d T , q T and d T ) all act to decrease the number of infected cells, resulting in both lower peak viraemia and a lower maximum number of endothelial activators.",

By contrast, Vaughn et al. [11] found that a higher viral clearance rate was associated with the development of DHF in a study of 51 individuals experiencing either a primary or a secondary infection. This latter study further showed that the viral clearance rate was significantly higher in secondary dengue infections than in primary dengue infections. Similarly, a third study of 248 individuals experiencing either a primary or a secondary infection [9] found a higher rate of viral clearance in secondary dengue infections than in primary dengue infections, along with a slightly lower rate of viral clearance in patients with DHF during the secondary infection, compared to those with DF. Figure 5c shows that our models predict a positive relationship between the rate of viral clearance (quantified as the maximal daily viral clearance rate) and the peak level of endothelial activators for both primary and secondary infections. When we assume T-cell-secreted cytokines contribute to disease severity, a given viral clearance rate results in a substantially higher peak level of endothelial activators compared to when T cells only play a protective role.",

This underscores the importance of large longitudinal cohort studies in facilitating the collection of these types of data. The Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Nicaragua [72] , for example, routinely tests children for dengue, and detects inapparent as well as symptomatic infections. This type of study should be able to obtain detailed viral measurements early in infection, specifically before viraemia peaks. Along with viral kinetic data, more detailed kinetic data of NK-and T-cell activation markers in relation to the timing of vascular leakage, the hallmark of DHF, are needed to help elucidate the extent of the protective role of NK cells and the contribution of T cells to disease severity.

Presumably, individuals are protected in a heterologous secondary infection for a period following a primary infection, because protective antibody levels remain sufficiently high to be capable of effectively neutralizing virus. In our model, this would lead to an increase in the viral clearance rate, lowering r and the within-host basic reproduction number.
