            "text": "With the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 and renewed attention on avian influenza viral pandemics, new surveillance systems are needed for the earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases. We applied a ''nextgeneration'' parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1-0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 mg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298-32,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (.90%) of reads were host genome-derived, 20-460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484-15,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78-98% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information. Although its cost and technological availability make it unlikely that this system will very soon be the diagnostic standard worldwide, this system could be useful for the earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses and bioterrorism, which are difficult to detect with conventional procedures.",

It is estimated that, on average, up to 40% of diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology [4] and that the majority (69%) of upper respiratory infections are caused by viruses, including undiscovered ones [1] .",

The most familiar formats use DNA or RNA target amplification methods, such as reverse transcription (RT) PCR, and have sensitivities that are greater than culture-or antigen-based procedures [3] . Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is more convenient and sensitive than PCR in amplifying DNA targets, and can be combined successfully with an RT step for RNA respiratory viruses. However, the wide variety of potential pathogens that elicit similar clinical symptoms and diseases makes the application of individual DNA-or RNA-based diagnostic assays both complex and expensive. Even multiplex PCRs are limited to 20-30 candidate pathogens, and may be confounded if viral evolution results in mutations at the primer binding sites [2] . DNA microarrays offer unprecedented opportunities for multiplexing; however, they are not widely implemented in clinical microbiology laboratories because of problems with sensitivity, throughput, and validation [2] . In addition, these microarrays are unavailable for unknown and/or unexpected microbes, as they require genetic information for each tested pathogen.",

Among these sequencing technologies, 454 currently offers by far the longest read length, ,250 bp on the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform [6] . Sequencing error levels are low (,1%) and arise primarily from homopolymer runs [7] , but tend to be resolved in cases where there is sufficient coverage depth to allow the assembly of overlapping reads [8] . Many studies have used 454 pyrosequencing for the analysis of PCR amplicons, bacterial artificial chromosomes, genomic, mitochondrial, plastid DNA, and expression profiling [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . 454 is also a powerful tool for pathogen discovery [15] , and was used with the GS platform to identify a new arenavirus transmitted through solid-organ transplantation [16] and a new polyomavirus in samples of Merkel cell skin carcinoma [17] . The 454 sequencing technique was also used to implicate Israeli acute paralysis virus as a significant marker for colony collapse disorder in honey bees [18] . Another group reported the whole genome analysis of Gallid herpesvirus, and showed that .99.0% coverage was obtained by assembling the raw sequence data to an overall average coverage depth of 13 [19] .",

The total number of PMMV reads outnumbered the norovirus reads in sample #N5 (Table 1 ). In addition, Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus (KGMMV) was also abundantly detected in sample #N3 (813 KGMMV-specific reads in a total 25,500 reads). KGMMV was also detected after ultracentrifugation (data not shown), suggesting that KGMMV viral particles were present in the human gut. Previously, PMMV was detected at 10 9 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter, and was detected in 12 (66.7%) of the 18 fecal samples collected from healthy humans [31] . This previous publication also showed that fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants [31] . Therefore, these plant-derived viruses may retain their infectivity in the feces and may even be present in diarrhea. Almost all of the detected viruses, except for the citrus tristeza virus, a member of the Closterovirus group, belong to the Tobamovirus group (Table 1) . It is currently unknown if there is an interaction between these plus-stranded RNA viruses and norovirus. The most abundantly detected PMMV was also found in healthy humans [31] . Although the previous paper [31] reported that there is a lack of evidence to show that active replication of PMMV occurs in human feces, further investigations regarding plant virus replication in the human gut (epithelial cells) seem necessary.",

Thus, not only respiratory specimens but also gastric and digestive specimens are important for the diagnosis of emerging infectious viruses, including those with airborne transmission. In this study, we isolated whole RNA and detected viral genes from nasal and stool samples with the 454 high-throughput sequencing system. Flu sequences were present in 20-460 of the 21,858-30,958 reads in each nasopharyngeal aspirate (Table 1) , and the cover rates ranged from 8.1-58.3% (Table 2) , which was sufficient for subtype identification in all three specimens. Furthermore, the near-complete norovirus genome sequence was obtained in two fecal specimens (#N2 and #N3), and more than 75% of the genome was covered in the other two specimens (#N4 and #N5) ( Table 3) . Recently, we subjected stool sample-extracted DNAs to 454 pyrosequencing, and found that nearly 20% of the reads had best hits that matched currently-reported bacterial DNA sequences [20] . These previous results, together with our findings here, indicate that two protocols, namely direct DNA extraction for bacteria and cell/bacterial removal by centrifugation followed by RNA/DNA extraction for virus, could be used to comprehensively identify pathogenic microbes in clinical samples.",

Indeed, the copy number of norovirus in the #N1 to #N5 samples ( Figure 1C ), as measured by semiquantitative PCR, was significantly correlated with the number of norovirus genome sequences as detected by high-throughput sequencing (Table 1 ). In the case of the nasal samples, the copy number of the influenza virus in sample #F2 was lower than those in samples #F1 and #F3, although the endpoints of the semiquantitative PCR for these samples were comparable ( Figure 1B) . This inconsistency could be due to differences in the sensitivities of Thus, quantitative analysis of host genes will be required. One potential reason for why we obtained fewer Flu-specific reads than norovirus reads in this study might have been the large number (90.0-94.6% of all reads) of host-derived sequences (Figure 2 and Table 5 ). These sequences were present because we performed direct RNA isolation from nasopharyngeal aspirates without first eliminating the cells or tissues. Most of the detected human-derived reads were non-coding regions, and fewer coding regions, including rRNA and mRNA sequences, were detected than expected (Table 5 ). These results suggest that, although contamination by human genomic DNA might be very low, an additional step for host gene removal is required. Suitable subtraction step(s) using pooled human genomic DNAs as drivers might be required to enrich in microbial genomes [15] . Alternatively, MICROBEnrich (Ambion Inc.), another method for removing contaminated human-derived RNA, could be useful to enrich microbial RNA [33] . However, the DNA virus WUV was detected from the isolated RNA, suggesting that the WUV genome and/or its transcripts present in infected cells were detected. Indeed, a novel human polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus), isolated from skin carcinoma, was detected from mRNA [17] . Taken together, these results indicate that whole RNA isolation, including host cells and tissues, followed by the suitable elimination of hostderived genes could be an effective method for identifying pathogenic viruses in clinical samples. When several pathogens are found in a single sample, a careful interpretation is necessary to decide which pathogen(s) is the real cause of a specific disease. Although, the most abundant pathogen might generally be considered to be the best candidate, cooperative interactions between multiple pathogens cannot be excluded as an important factor for pathogenesis. To address this question, suitable control samples from healthy persons and/or pair specimens, isolated after recovery, might be required.",

As shown in Figure S1 , a significant bias was found and its pattern was identical in all samples. TG (CA)-rich regions were selectively amplified with the WTA kit (Table S3) , probably due to nucleotide sequences of the quasi-random primer. Random RT-PCR amplification using the WTA kit was at least one log higher than that using the conventional random hexamer (data not shown). This suggests that further improvement is required for whole viral genome analysis, although our system is suitable for the comprehensive detection of viral genes. In addition, the TG (CA)rich bias was observed within the viral genome; therefore, it seems unlikely that the bias leads to quantitative differences of the detected sequences with respect to the original population. Almost all diagnostic NATs require viral genome information, and thus cannot be performed for novel or unexpected viral infections. In this study, we showed that a diagnostic system based on parallel high-throughput sequencing is useful for the direct detection of unknown and/or small numbers of viruses, as well as for the genetic characterization of major pathogenic viruses in clinical specimens. We plan to share this system domestically as well as with the Asian epidemic network (The Program of Founding Research Centers for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases; http:// www.crnid.riken.jp), in order to enable the earlier identification of unknown pathogens in a novel outbreak or bioterrorism.",

The samples were nasopharyngeal aspirates and stools (n = 3 and 5, respectively) isolated during 2005-2007 in Osaka, Japan. Seasonal influenza A virus (Flu) in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 3-to 7-year-old children was detected by a rapid diagnostic kit (immunochromatography) using Flu-specific antibodies. In 2006/2007, a large-scale norovirus outbreak occurred in Osaka, Japan, mainly infecting patients in nursing homes and welfare facilities (53%), hospitals (27%), kindergartens (15%), and elementary and junior high schools (5%) [26] . #N1 to #N3 samples were collected during this outbreak. #N1 sample was derived from a hospitalized patient and #N2 and #N3 samples were derived from patients in a welfare facility in 2006 (October to December). #N4 sample was a kindergarten student when an outbreak occurred at the elementary school of its elder brother and sister. In contrast to these four cases of putative human-to-human transmission, #N5 sample was oyster-associated. #N4 and #N5 samples were collected in May 2005 and January 2006, respectively. Diagnosis of norovirus infection was based on RT-PCR [26] . The collected stool was suspended with an equal amount of PBS and was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants (0.25 ml) were used for RNA isolation. This study was approved by the ethical review committees of the RIMD, Osaka University, Osaka Prefectural Institute of Public Health, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and RIKEN.",

Data analysis was performed on each read sequence by computational tools, as constructed previously [20] with some modifications. The analysis steps were: (i) remove tag sequences; (ii) execute a BLASTN search by Hi-per BLAST (Fujitsu); (iii) identify the scientific name for each read based on the NCBI taxonomy database; (iv) extract viral reads and perform mapping to reference data by SSEARCH. This analysis pipeline was constructed by utilizing BioRuby [39] , BioPerl [40] , and MySQL. After classification, particular human and bacterial reads were further analyzed as follows. Human genome mapping was performed by MEGABLAST search against the Human Genome, Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.49, using a threshold of 1E-40. Bacterial rRNA typing was performed by BLASTN search against the comprehensive rRNA database ''silva'' release 94 [41] using a threshold of 80% match per read. ",

The samples were nasopharyngeal aspirates and stools (n = 3 and 5, respectively) isolated during 2005-2007 in Osaka, Japan. Influenza A virus and norovirus were detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples, respectively, with other diagnostic methods. (A) RNA extracted from clinical specimens was reverse-transcribed and random-PCR amplified to prepare template DNA for pyrosequencing. One microgram of amplified PCR products in each sample was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. M indicates 100-bp DNA ladder (NEB). (B) Flu-specific semi-quantitative PCR was performed with 10-fold serial dilutions of the random-PCR products. (C) Norovirus (GII)-specific semi-quantitative PCR was performed with 10-fold serial dilutions of the random-PCR products. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR using a norovirus-specific primer set was also performed, and the estimated copy numbers of norovirus in samples #N1-#N5 are shown in the panel on the right. As a control, cDNA from sample #N3 without random PCR amplification was used (left panel). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004219.g001",
