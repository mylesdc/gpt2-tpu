Protocols and primers used for screening bird samples cDNA for influenza screening was synthesized using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) in a 20-\u00b5l reaction mixture following the manufacturer's protocol with 11.5-\u00b5l of RNA and a 10\u00b5M concentration of a Uni-12 specific primer (5'-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3'). A 5x RT Buffer, 0.1M dithiothreitol (DTT), 10mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (dNTP), and 200U of SuperScript II RT. Samples were tested for influenza A using a Taqman qPCR assay designed to amplify a conserved region of the matrix gene. A 25-\u00b5l reaction was used containing 2x RT Buffer (Biorad), 10\u00b5M forward and reverse primer, 20\u00b5M probe, and 4-\u00b5l of cDNA Complementary DNA was also synthesized from RNA with random hexamers using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocols. This cDNA was screened for astroviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses in an Applied Biosystems Veriti 96 well thermocycler. Astrovirus detection followed a heminested protocol where a 25-\u00b5l initial reaction was used containing 1x buffer Taq (Thermo   Scientific) . After an initial denaturation period at 94\u00b0C for 3 minutes, 30 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 30 seconds. This was followed by a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 minutes before being held at 10\u00b0C until removal from the thermocycler. The heminested step used 1-\u00b5l of the first round PCR product as template and follows the same protocol as the first PCR (2).",
