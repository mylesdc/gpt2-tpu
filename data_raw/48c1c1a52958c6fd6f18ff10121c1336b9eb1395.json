However, while much has been written regarding China-Africa aid overall, relatively little attention has been given to China's health aid. To better understand these investments, we provide an overview of the current framework and characteristics of China's health aid to Africa. China's health assistance has been perceived by some as opportunistic, largely as a demonstration of China's engagement in \"soft power\" and an attempt to enhance its access to natural resources and political favors by African countries. Others have attributed altruistic intent, aiming to support the advancement of the health of populations in the African continent with a \"no strings attached\" approach. Our overview demonstrated that despite the magnitude of China's health assistance, many questions remain regarding the scope of this aid, its effectiveness and the governance mechanisms that guide the conceptualization and implementation of such efforts. We also identified the need for a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the various elements of China's health assistance to African countries in order to gain a deeper understanding of how priorities and allocations for health aid are determined, how such aid fits within the specific African country's health strategies and to assess the effectiveness of such aid. Insights garnered through such an assessment could help determine future priorities for investment as well as inform efforts to optimize the value of China's aid for the populations of the recipient countries.",

As part of this investment, health-related aid is a key priority, with China now ranking among the top 10 bilateral global health donors to Africa [2] .

The most typical form of China's health assistance has been the dispatching of Chinese medical teams (CMT). In 2014 for example, there were 43 CMT sent to 42 African countries [3] . The CMT program operates at an estimated annual cost of 200 million to 409.6 million RMB (29.45 million to 60 million USD) [4, 5] . Apart from the CMT program, China also has assisted in the construction of health facilities, the contribution of medical equipment and drugs, and the training of African health care workers. By 2014, China had helped build 30 hospitals and 30 malaria prevention and control centers in Africa, invested 800 million RMB (123.9 million USD) in medical equipment, supplies and anti-malaria drugs, and trained over 3,000 health care workers from various African countries [3] .",

Chinese overseas health assistance has its roots in the ideological concerns during the Cold War when China dispatched its first medical team to Algeria in 1963 [6] . Since that time, China has indicated that its aid was grounded in the \"Eight Principles for Economic Aid and Technical Assistance to Other Countries\" originally articulated by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1964, which were described as anchored in \"equality, mutual benefit with no strings attached\" [1, 7] . China's current assistance and investment policies in Africa are largely guided by the 2006 document entitled, \"China's African Policy\", which indicates that China \"will continue to send medical teams and provide medicines and medical materials to African countries, and help them establish and improve medical facilities and train medical personnel.\" It also states that \"China will increase its exchanges and cooperation with African countries in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and malaria and other diseases, research and application of traditional medicine and experience concerning mechanism for public health emergencies\" [8] .",

It should be noted that China's health aid is primarily managed by the Ministry of Commerce, with the participation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the National Health and Family Planning Commission, with oversight from the State Council [10] . While the Chinese national government takes the lead to initiate and negotiate bilateral agreements with African countries, the implementation of these agreements rests with China's provincial or subnational governments. In addition, China's existing foreign aid policies are based largely on ad hoc central ministerial documents and regulations, which are not subject to approval by the legislative branch [11] . Furthermore, competition within the Chinese government ministries and at provincial levels further undermines the overall cohesion and coordination of China's aid [12] . For example, individual provincial Chinese governments are designated to provide specific African countries with medical teams, thus, this results in the allocation of different levels of resources to health projects based on provincial interest and their local capacity [13] . This has resulted in variations in the quantity and quality of the assistance provided to recipient African countries [14] .",

In the ensuing decades, China paid less attention to Africa as it sought to find its place in the international marketplace.

In addition, Thompson and Youde posited that providing healthcare resources not only helps China gain favorable trading terms and access to necessary resources, but also supports the government's attempts to portray itself as a good international citizen [31, 32] . However, despite the fact that China has become more active in global health, Huang warns that China's pursuit of health as primarily foreign policy could undermine its incentives and efficacy for greater international health engagement [6] .",

For example, China's health assistance to foreign countries may be hindered by domestic pressure to provide healthcare for its own people [11, 31] . Also, with the increasingly profit-based character of China's health system, many Chinese physicians may not be willing to serve overseas as part of medical teams, especially physicians from economically developed Chinese provinces [34, 35] .",

In recent years, a trend can be observed in which China has adjusted its health aid focus towards a more diversified approach that aims to contribute to the development of local health systems [36] . This shift may have been motivated by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002, which prompted China's recognition of the importance of public health not only as a domestic issue but also as global public good [37] . China, along with other BRIC countries, has seen strong growth in its total health expenditure while at the same time its contribution to the global health care market is believed to have surpassed those of most G7 economies [38] . The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa revealed the fragility of health systems in the affected countries and to some extent reinforced for China the need to engage in strengthening health systems. Consequently, China was one of the first countries to provide aid and medical workers to the region at the height of the Ebola crisis [39] . Similarly, China is also participating in an international task force to design the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (African CDC), with an additional 2 million USD contribution to its 2016 budget [40] . China has also affirmed its commitment to universal health coverage (UHC) and is working with African governments to build their own capacity to achieve UHC, focusing on technology transfers, pharmaceutical capacity around essential medicines and training of African health personnel [39, 41] . These new efforts suggest an encouraging new direction for China with the demonstration of a more explicit commitment to public health and sustainable development rather than its traditional focus on curative medicine and \"brick and mortar\" infrastructure.",
