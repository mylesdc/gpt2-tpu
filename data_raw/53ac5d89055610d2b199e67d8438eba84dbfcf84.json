The dynamics of the airborne propagation and the genetic diversity of S. aureus isolated in an academic dental clinic environment were investigated using isoenzyme typing. Material and Methods: The isoenzymes of 44 previously reported isolates were obtained from fresh cultures and extracted using glass beads. Nine isoenzymes were investigated using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). The genetic diversity and relationship among the strains (electrophoretic type -ET) were determined using statistics previously described by Nei 25 (1972) and the SAHN grouping method (UPGMA algorithm). Results: Clonal pattern analyses indicated a high level of genetic polymorphism occurring among the 33 ETs, which were grouped into five taxa. Each taxon presented one or more clusters that were moderately related and that contained two or more identical/highly related isolates, revealing seasonal airborne propagation in these dental clinic environments.",

Dental practitioners treat a wide range of patients. Therefore, it is likely that they will have contact with people colonized or infected with drug-resistant microorganisms 4 Phenotype-and genotype-based methods have allowed researchers to classify microbial isolates in systematic, taxonomic, evolutionary, phylogenetic, and epidemiological studies 2, 28 . MLEE has been used for several decades as a standard method in eukaryotic population genetics and systematics 26 as well as in large-scale studies to estimate the genetic diversity and structure in natural populations of a variety of bacterial 23 , fungal, and yeast 3 species. Its special advantage is that mobility variants (electromorphs or allozymes) of an enzyme can be directly equated with alleles at the corresponding structural gene loci.",

This method represents an invaluable complement to the most recent molecular typing methods, particularly for large-scale epidemiological studies 2 . In addition, MLEE possesses an excellent typeability (i.e., the percentage of distinct strains obtained), excellent reproducibility (i.e., the percentage of strains that show the same results in repeated assays), and good discriminatory power (i.e., its ability to differentiate unrelated strains) 2,3 .",

Genetic interpretation of the MLEE patterns Pattern interpretation was performed following the general rules commonly accepted in the deduction of allelic composition for haploid organisms. The bands on the gels were numbered in order of decreasing mobility, and their corresponding alleles were numbered by using the same nomenclature. A lack of demonstrable activity for an enzyme was scored as one null allele at the corresponding gene locus. Each unique combination of alleles over the 14 enzyme loci examined resulted in an electrophoretic type (ET)subtype or strain 28 . Discriminatory power The discriminatory power of the MLEE method, which is based on the numeric interpretation of electrophoretic patterns, was established using the numerical index of discrimination (D), which is according to the probability that two unrelated isolates sampled from the test population will be classified into different types (i.e., strains or ETs). This probability can be calculated using Simpson's index of diversity, developed to describe species' diversity within an ecological habitat.

A tree with twodimensional classifications (dendrogram), based on matrix d ij , was generated using the SAHN grouping method (Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchic, Nonoverlapping Clustering Methods) and UPGMA algorithm (Unweighted Pair-Group Method using an Arithmetic Average) 3 . Because MLEE provides all levels of relatedness, which must be resolved by DNA fingerprinting methods (i.e., identifying the same strain in independent isolates, identifying microevolutionary changes in a strain, identifying clusters of moderately related isolates, and identifying completely unrelated isolates), a threshold (average value:d ij ) was established in the dendrograms to identify clusters of identical isolates and highly related isolates and taxa (singular taxon, i.e., a taxonomic group of any nature or rank) (0\u00a3 d ij < d ij ) X ij stands for the character state value of character i in the operational taxonomy unit (OTU) j, X j is the mean of all state values for OTU j, and n is the number of characters sampled], was used as a measure of the agreement between the genetic distance values implied by the UPGMA dendrograms and the ones from the original genetic distance matrices (d ij ).

The high discriminatory capacity (i.e., >98% probability that two unrelated S. aureus isolates sampled from the test population will be classified as different types or strains) of MLEE, which is based on the interpretation of enzyme electrophoretic patterns, was also observed (i.e., the combination of existing alleles in 14 enzymatic loci revealed 33 ETs). MLEE has again been proven to be a powerful tool for typing S.aureus strains for epidemiological studies. The results related to the reproducibility and discriminatory power of MLEE corroborate with those previously reported by other medically relevant studies 24,28 ; however, the discriminatory power described here is higher than those reported by other groups 7,17 . Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in almost all natural populations, at all levels of genetic organization and from genotypic characteristics to phenotypic traits. The possible reasons for their existence have been the object of a long debate in population genetics and molecular evolution 10,11 . S. aureus is a heterogeneous (polymorphic) species 8 that has a clonal population structure 6 . Therefore, it is believed that S. aureus does not undergo extensive recombination, diversifies largely by nucleotide mutations, and displays a high degree of linkage disequilibrium (nonrandom associations between genetic loci). A certain structural genetic locus is defined as polymorphic when the frequency of its most common allele presents a value below 0.99 (99%). Some of the measurements used to quantify this variability in organism populations are the gene and allele frequencies, the polymorphic loci percentage, the average number of alleles per locus, the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus, and the heterozygosity 14 . In this study, quantitative and qualitative variations of the polymorphic loci (12 85.7% enzymatic loci polymorphic for two, three, four, and five alleles), the average number of alleles per locus (2.57) and the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus (2.83) were observed in S. aureus population isolated from dental clinic environments (air). These variations have been observed in several genetic diversity studies of S. aureus populations recovered from human and bovine sources 7,8,17,22 . In addition, the genetic polymorphisms found among S. aureus isolates revealed a polyclonal pattern for air dispersion over time. However, monoclonal air dispersion was also observed for some of the isolates (isolates 9 ET15 and 10 ET15 , 42 ET1 and 43 ET1 , 36 ET11 and",

            "text": "agents, S. aureus strains have the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for an average of 5 days9 . Recently, the frequency of S. aureus isolated from the noses, hands, and tongues of students and patients and from the clinical environment of a pediatric Dentistry clinic before and after dental treatment was determined24  . The highest concentration of S. aureus was found in the noses and on the tongues of children and among the dental students, and the highest level of contamination was observed on gloved hands, which was followed by the tongue and hands without gloves before clinical care. At the end of dental treatment,S. aureus colonies isolated from the gloved hands of students decreased significantly. Considering the clinical environment, S. aureus dissemination increased at the end of dental procedures, and the most contaminated areas were the auxiliary table and the storeroom, which was located at the center of the clinic. Such results can be explained by the intense circulation of people in the clinic and the use of high-speed dental handpieces. However, it is still speculated that much of the S. aureus contamination detected in the clinical environment came from other sources, such as direct contact, skin exfoliation or the improper handling of plates, and it is concluded that the dental clinic is an appropriate environment for S. aureus cross-transmission. The survival of S. aureus on white coats over a 24-h period was investigated by van der Reijdena and colleagues 30 (2009). Immediately after inoculation, only 0.16% of the cells survived. The number of viable cells decreased further to 0.046% after 1 h and to 0.014% after 24 h. To explore the capacity of bacteria to transfer from a white coat to another surface, the number of viable bacteria following a transfer to a stainless steel disc was also determined 30 . The number of recovered cells after contacting the stainless steel surface was not significantly different from the number before the contact, regardless of the dryness of the coat. Even airborne transfers of bacteria by moving contaminated pieces of white coat over agar plates in a disinfected laminar flow cabinet revealed a comparably low recovery of pathogenic bacteria after a direct recovery from the fabric 30 . The use of white coats in dental and medical clinics has been a common practice to prevent the contamination of healthcare workers by the pathogenic microorganisms found on patients or vice versa. It is well known that aerosols of 59 general dentists in Japan, concerning cross-infection control and their awareness of the possibility of microbial contamination on dental impressions and gypsum casts, were analyzed. The results demonstrated the presence of streptococci (100%), staphylococci (65.4%), Candida (46.2%), methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) (15.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.7%) on the impressions and the gypsum casts. Only 54% of the general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics, and only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of MRSA or P. aeruginosa on impressions and gypsum casts. This knowledge confirmed the need for dental clinics to use appropriate infection control procedures and to prevent the possibility of cross-contamination, which results in infections by opportunistic pathogens, among patients and dental office and laboratory personnel 5 . In a previous study, the contamination degree and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus isolated from different touchable surfaces before, during, and after clinical procedures revealed an increase in the number of microorganisms during clinical procedures 19 . In addition, that study provided evidence that clinical procedures increased the number and proportion of antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus isolates dispersed in a dental clinic environment and highlighted the need to establish strategies to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains in dental settings. In this context, infection control guidelines and published research pertinent to dental infection control principles and practices, such as the one revised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), must be applied by the dentist as a matter of routine in academic dental offices 16 . Conclusion Because molecular-based epidemiological studies are useful in identifying possible sources of the spread of microorganisms in dental hospitals and clinical settings, this study contributes to our knowledge on to identify a high degree of genetic polymorphism among S. aureus isolates, mono-and polyclonality patterns (bacterial strains dispersion in air environment of the academic dental clinic over time), taxa and clusters displaying variable frequencies of strains and possibly microevolutionary changes.",
