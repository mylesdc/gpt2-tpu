However, the effect of exacerbations in young children with CF is not fully understood. We sought to characterize the frequency and clinical impact of PEx in a pilot study of infants and pre-school aged children with CF. Methods: Thirty young children with CF [median (range) 1.5 years (0.2-4.9)] were prospectively followed for 2 years. Exacerbation frequency (hospitalizations and outpatient antibiotic use) was determined. Chest radiographs were performed at enrollment and study completion and assigned a Brasfield score. Lung function at age 7 years was assessed in a subset of children. The association between PEx frequency, chest radiograph score, and lung function was determined using Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Correlations with an absolute magnitude of 0.3 or greater were considered clinically significant. Results: Over 2 years, participants experienced a median of two PEx (range 0-13). Chest radiograph scores at enrollment and study completion were inversely associated with PEx frequency (R = \u22120.48 and R = \u22120.44, respectively). The association between frequency of PEx and lung function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 )] at age 7 years was small (R = 0.20). Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) at 7 years was associated with more frequent PEx during the study (R = 0.44). Conclusions: Children with worse chest radiograph scores had more frequent PEx over the subsequent 2 years, suggesting a group of patients at higher risk for PEx. Frequent PEx in infants and young children with CF were not associated with lower FEV 1 and FVC at 7 years, although spirometry in this age group may not be a sensitive marker of mild lung disease and disease progression.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, life-limiting disease characterized by airway inflammation, infection, progressive obstructive lung disease and lung function decline [1] . Lung involvement is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF [2] . It is known in older children and adults that pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) lead to lung function decline [3] . However, the effect of PEx on clinical outcomes in young children with CF is not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that airway inflammation [4, 5] and bronchiectasis [6] [7] [8] occur in infants and preschoolers with CF indicating that lung damage occurs early in life. Additionally, newborn screening has led to earlier diagnosis and provides an opportunity for medical interventions to slow the progression of lung disease [9, 10] . Accordingly, we sought to examine the frequency of PEx in a cohort of infants and preschool aged children with CF and the relationship of these exacerbations to clinical outcomes, including Brasfield chest x-ray (CXR) scores and lung function at 7 years. Most PEx in children are treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics [11] ; thus, we captured these events as well as hospitalizations. We employed oropharyngeal cultures, the standard of care in the United States for monitoring airway infections in non-expectorating patients, to determine airway microbiology. We hypothesized that those with more frequent PEx during the study period would have worse clinical outcomes at the conclusion of the study (CXR scores) and at school age (lung function).",

Potential subjects were approached and recruited for the study during regularly scheduled clinic visits. Subjects completed study visits at their quarterly CF clinic visits and at the time of clinician defined PEx for 2 years (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The determination of a PEx was based on two criteria: 1) diagnosis by the primary CF provider and 2) initiation of oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics for respiratory symptoms. A standardized definition of PEx was not used in order to capture all antibiotic courses that were prescribed. However, using criteria from the Inhaled Hypertonic Saline in Infants Study (ISIS), the subjects' signs and symptoms as well as reasons for treatment with antibiotics were retrospectively analyzed to determine how many of these encounters would have been classified as exacerbations based on standardized criteria [12] .",

Spirometry is a less sensitive marker of structural damage in mild disease [19] ; thus, particularly in young children, it may be that abnormalities in spirometry will only become apparent after longer follow up times. This may explain why the number of exacerbations was associated with worse chest x-ray scores but not with spirometry values. A potentially more sensitive marker of lung disease, lung clearance index (LCI) has been compared to spirometry including FEV1 in several studies. Abnormalities in LCI are detected earlier than abnormalities in FEV 1 [20] [21] [22] [23] . Worsening LCI measurements over time have been shown in young children with CF compared to healthy controls, whereas, no difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1 compared to healthy controls was found [24] .

Spirometry values (FEV 1 and FVC) were not lower in patients with more frequent exacerbations, contrary to our hypothesis, suggesting treatment with antibiotics in the setting of increased respiratory symptoms is beneficial. However, spirometry in this age range may not be the most sensitive marker for mild lung disease or disease progression. Additional studies are indicated in order to better understand the impact of pulmonary exacerbations, oral antibiotic treatment and the effect on lung function. Furthermore, our study provides data with respect to chest x-ray score, frequency of exacerbations and the relationship between exacerbations, antibiotic use and lung function that could be used in power analyses for larger studies.",

Study visits were performed at quarterly CF visits and at the time of an exacerbation over a two-year period. At each study visit, subjects underwent a history, physical, medication history and a culture obtained by oropharyngeal (OP) swab. Chest radiographs were done at study enrollment and at study completion (2 years) during periods of clinical stability and assigned a Brasfield score. (JPEG 27 kb) Additional file 2: Table S1 . Components of Chest X-ray Score for Individual Subjects: Components of the chest x-ray score at study enrollment and study completion are provided for each individual subject. (DOCX 32 kb) Additional file 3: Table S2 . Pulmonary function testing results: Absolute, z-score and percent predicted values of FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC are provided for each subject. (DOCX 14 kb) Additional file 4: Figure S2 . Relationship between lung function at 7 years and Wisconsin cough score at enrollment: A loess curve (grey line) was used to display the association and is plotted with a 95% confidence interval (shaded band). Higher FEV1 percent predicted at school age was associated with a lower Wisconsin cough score at enrollment. The corresponding linear association for the rank transformed variables is indicated by the Spearman's rank-based correlation coefficient in the upper right hand corner. (PDF 83 kb) ",
