Therefore, outbreaks of infectious diseases causing critical illness could potentially be detected in hospital settings that care for such patients, such as the ICU and emergency department, which therefore become logical targets for health system strengthening.",

Development of the materials was publicly financed, free of commercial influence and included input from a broad spectrum of experts with experience in resourcelimited settings. This intervention addressed the challenge of bringing evidence-based care to the bedside of patients by adapting materials to the needs of clinicians who may not be formally trained in critical care, emphasizing the provision of safe care and using an interactive teaching approach. The teaching materials were developed in a process of peer review, refinement and pilot testing and were designed by collaboration between critical care and instructional design experts. The participants rated the course's content, structure and teaching methods highly. International facilitators delivered the course and mentored local clinicians to conduct future trainings. We also observed that the course provided a forum for local, national, regional and global networking that was valued by many clinicians.",

We have shown the feasibility of creating and delivering an evidence-based and interactive Critical Care Training Short Course for non-specialty and specialty clinicians in resource-limited settings, using a collaborative approach between the WHO, a global network of experts in critical care and infectious disease, instructional designers, national Ministries of Health and local clinicians. Despite challenges related to sustainability and dissemination, we believe that targeted clinical short courses integrated into national capacity-strengthening initiatives will help healthcare systems to better care for critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections.

Fifth, the success of this course requires acceptance by local champions and adaptation to local settings, resource constraints, and baseline knowledge and experience of participants. Finally, it is imperative to work closely with Ministries of Health to select appropriate participants. This Critical Care Training Short Course faces multiple challenges to sustainability. The technical content must be kept up to date with evolving clinical research and guidelines. The course methodology and structure may need further revision in response to participant feedback, such as inclusion of hands-on training with mechanical ventilators. Achieving global impact will require scaling up to reach more clinicians; recruitment, coordination and retention of expert clinician facilitators; development of a train-the-trainers model to sustain instruction by local clinicians; translation of materials into local languages; and development of alternate online or smartphone dissemination methods. Our experiences in Central Asia, Indonesia and Vietnam suggest that these barriers can be overcome, as these countries are planning national course implementations (Janet Diaz, Selamet Hidayat, Vu Quoc Dat; personal communications). Finally, evaluation of the course's impact on longer-term knowledge retention, processes of care and patient-centred outcomes is necessary. The WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness programme provides an example of both the benefits 31,32 and challenges 33 of implementing teaching materials to improve clinical outcomes for seriously ill children. Following the trainings described in this manuscript (2009-2013), this course has been successfully delivered in China, Egypt, Palestine, Fiji, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Philippines, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, with over 1000 clinicians trained.Our experience suggests that 3 days is the minimum time to deliver the content and conduct case-based discussions to consolidate learning points without overwhelming participants with information. In countries where simultaneous translation is used, 3 days may not be enough.",
