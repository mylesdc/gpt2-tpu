            "text": "Background: Recent and previous studies have shown that guinea pigs can be infected with, and transmit, human influenza viruses. Therefore guinea pig may be a useful animal model for better understanding influenza infection and assessing vaccine strategies. To more fully characterize the model, antibody responses following either infection/re-infection with human influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 or immunization with its homologous recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein were studied. Results: Serological samples were collected and tested for anti-HA immunoglobulin by ELISA, antiviral antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and recognition of linear epitopes by peptide scanning (PepScan). Animals inoculated with infectious virus demonstrated pronounced viral replication and subsequent serological conversion. Animals either immunized with the homologous HA antigen or infected, showed a relatively rapid rise in antibody titers to the HA glycoprotein in ELISA assays. Antiviral antibodies, measured by HI assay, were detectable after the second inoculation. PepScan data identified both previously recognized and newly defined linear epitopes. Conclusions: Infection and/or recombinant HA immunization of guinea pigs with H3N2 Wyoming influenza virus resulted in a relatively rapid production of viral-specific antibody thus demonstrating the strong immunogenicity of the major viral structural proteins in this animal model for influenza infection. The sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model of influenza infection and immunization.",

            "text": "The most common mammalian model used for influenza virus research, the mouse, is not susceptible to infection with many unadapted human influenza A viruses of the H3N2 serotype and does not shed virus from the respiratory tract. Ferrets and macaques have increased tropisms to many primary influenza isolates but both are expensive to maintain and difficult to house. Based largely on their recapitulation of human disease signs, ferrets have also been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. However, recent reports suggest that ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses, and that serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy [1, 2] . Therefore, there is a need to develop additional permissive small animal models of influenza virus infection that exhibit virus shedding. Serial samples collected from such animal models allow the investigator to determine both the titer and duration of virus shedding from individual animals at multiple times without euthanasia. Further characterization of animal models capable of replicating and transmitting unadapted human, avian, and/or swine influenza viruses can be valuable for studying and testing new and improved vaccines, immunobiotics and anti-virals. Two promising alternative animal models, guinea pigs and cotton rats, have recently been investigated for the analysis of human influenza virus and influenza vaccine [3, 4] . These studies focus on the guinea pig as a model for influenza.",

Guinea pigs are relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain for larger studies compared to ferrets and simians. They are readily infected with primary isolates of human influenza strains, and have potential uses for virus evolutionary, prophylactic and therapeutic studies [3] . A small number of reports describing experimental infection of guinea pigs with human influenza viruses were published in the 1970 s and 80 s [5] [6] [7] [8] . More recently, we and others have advanced the guinea pig model for the study of virus infection and spread and as a vaccine-challenge model [3] . Guinea pigs can be readily infected with human influenza isolates without prior tissue culture or animal adaptation. The infection in guinea pigs appears to be centered largely in the upper naso-respiratory tract and the animals can pass the virus to others via aerosol transmission [9] . A recent study demonstrated acute viral replication and moderate virulence of the highly pathogenic 1918 pandemic and H5N1 viruses in addition to low-pathogenicity avian and human H1N1 viruses in guinea pigs [10] .",

Nasal wash samples were collected at 2, 3, 6 and 9 days post infection (dpi). The guinea pigs exhibited no outward clinical signs of infection and virus was recovered from nasal washes of each animal between 2 and 6 dpi [3] . Peak titers of progeny virus in this study occurred on day 3 and were in the range of 5 \u00d7 10 4 and 2 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/mL of nasal wash fluid (Long et al, in preparation). Serological samples were prepared over the course of the regimen for analysis of total anti-HA antibodies by HA ELISA, antiviral antibodies by HI assay, and identification of linear HA epitopes by PepScan ELISA. Equal volumes of sera from each individual were used to produce pools for each time point in each group. To assess the levels of total HA-specific antibodies, serological samples were assayed by ELISA using plates coated with commercially prepared full-length Wyoming HA glycoprotein ( Figure 1 ). Inoculation with virus and subsequent infection of these guinea pigs resulted in a rise in ELISA titer to the HA protein by the 2 nd week which continued to increase through Week 4.",

In the process of developing and testing vaccines for the stimulation of broadened immunity, it is necessary to raise sera in multiple species of animals for analysis of cross-strain antiviral responses. In addition, it would be helpful to assess protection from cross-strain challenge in multiple animal models. Because of the attractiveness of the guinea pig model for infection with influenza, we have characterized the immune responses after infection or immunization of guinea pigs. Here we present an immunological Figure 4 PepScan ELISA of serum pools from guinea pig infected with influenza virus. Serum pools (1:750) from Group 2 animals were analyzed for recognition of linear epitopes by reactivity to overlapping peptides bound to microtiter plates. Sequential bleeds were tested from the prebleed (A) and 2 (B), 5 (C), 9(D), 11 (E) and 12 (F) weeks after the initial infection. Reactivity to peptides from sera after infection was compared to the results from the pre-infected sera to identify virus-specific epitopes induced during infection.",

The data demonstrated that guinea pigs readily seroconvert in response to both intranasal inoculations of virus and immunizations with the same recombinant HA glycoprotein. A rise in binding antibodies (ELISA positive) preceded the development of antiviral antibodies as determined by hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI positive) for both infected and immunized groups of guinea pigs. The initial lag period was followed by strong correlation between the continued elevation of binding and antiviral (HI) antibodies. ELISA titers rose to approximately 1:100 titers after single inoculations with either infectious virus or purified HA antigen. Peak ELISA titers of infected animals reached 1:10,000, while those of immunized animals reached 1:100,000. However, if Groups 3 and 4 had been limited to only two doses, then titers may have more closely matched Group 2. Measurable antiviral titer required a second dose of virus or immunogen. HI titers of both infected and immunized animals reached approximately 1:1000 and decayed slightly over time. The lack of measurable antiviral immune responses observed before the second inoculation of any of the experimental groups may be due to the lower sensitivity of the HI assay, and is not necessarily an indication that the first infection or immunization did not elicit HI responses. Both ELISA and antiviral antibody titers persisted for many weeks following the final infectious innocula or boost with HA protein. Little, if any, decay of ELISA or HI titers were observed through",

However, the continued improvements in peptide synthesis suggested that the approach should be revisited and expanded to encompass the entire HA protein. Interestingly, the data from this study identified two immunodominant epitopes, represented by peptides with N-terminal amino acids 141 and 327, which are recognized by both preimmune and immune sera. While the interpretation of reactivity by pre-immune sera remains open, these results suggest that recognition of viral epitopes is present in the innate repertoire. If so, it is possible that pre-infection recognition plays a role in skewing the immune system towards a more oligoclonal rather than polyclonal response. Induction of an immune response limited to a small set of epitopes may accentuate recognition of immunodominant epitopes that are often present in regions of high genetic variability in Class II pathogens [13] . The ability to take advantage of the propensity of host immune systems to mount strain-specific immune responses largely limited to variable immunodominant epitopes may be a pathogenesis trait that influenza and other viruses have evolved so as to increase fitness on a landscape made more rugged by host immunity. Serum from the high dose immunization group (Group 4) showed increased reactivity to peptides 141 and 135 ( Figure 6 ) which both represent a highly variable and immunogenic loop of Epitope A [23] . Unexpectedly, reactivities to additional peptides (9, 327, 453, and 483) derived from regions outside of previously defined epitopes, and near the transmembrane domain, were observed after multiple immunizations and two infectious innocula. The amino acid sequences at the cores of these peptides are highly conserved among influenza A strains. The observation of linear epitopes does not preclude the reactivity of the sera to more dominant conformational epitopes that were not detected by this method. However, in a recent study of cross-reactive epitopes in avian influenza serotypes, Meuller et al. identified several linear epitopes in the HA of H4, H5, and H12 through a similar use of overlapping peptide ELISA [24] . We have aligned the sets of peptides used in both studies to determine analogous peptides so that the results can be compared more easily (data not shown). Interestingly, analogues of many of the H3N2 peptides that were recognized in the present study were also recognized by sera against the avian HA glycoproteins. Avian sera recognized analogues to peptides 141 and 327, which were recognized by preimmune Guinea pig sera. In addition, avian sera also recognized analogues to peptides 9, 453, and 483. The contribution of reactivity to these peptides towards antiviral activities will require further investigation. Future studies have been planned to characterize the PepScan reactivities of sera from humans infected or immunized with influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003.",

The infected guinea pigs mounted vigorous immune responses that had antiviral activities as measured by HI assay. Guinea pigs immunized with purified HA protein developed similar antiviral activities. Pepscan data determined that sera from na\u00efve animals recognize a linear epitope in the defined A epitope and another epitope near the fusion or HA cleavage sites. Further studies will be required to determine whether these innate reactivities are also found in sera from na\u00efve humans. If so, it will be important to assess whether these antibodies offer any protective immunity, or are dysregulatory in nature. Pepscan data also demonstrated the reactivity of sera from infected and immunized animals to linear determinants located both within and outside of previously defined major epitopes. The change in PepScan profiles over the course of the immunization and infection regimens appeared to reflect maturation of the humoral immune responses to linear epitopes. By altering the immunogenicity of the most dominant, yet variable, epitopes, it may be possible to refocus the immune response towards more highly conserved epitopes to derive a more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine [13, 14] . Subunit vaccines, along with well-defined animal models for influenza research, have the potential to more rapidly, and accurately guide the development of future vaccines for both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks.",

The virus was propagated in monolayer cultures of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC #CCL-34) using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza), supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (Lonza). For plaque assays, virus samples were serially diluted into 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and placed into 6-well plates confluent with MDCK cells. After an 1-hour (h) incubation, the innocula were replaced by a mixture of 1% molten agar in complete growth media. Upon solidification of the agar, the plates were inverted and incubated in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator. Plaques were typically visible for enumeration or isolation 3-4 days after inoculation. Prior to introduction into animals, MDCK propagated virus stocks were titered using a plaque assay and adjusted to 3 \u00d7 10 5 plaqueforming units/mL (pfu/mL) with sterile saline.",

S2 drosophila cells were co-transfected with the HA expression plasmid and pCoBLAST (Invitrogen, Inc), and stable transformants selected with blastocidin (30 micrograms/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expression of recombinant HA protein was induced for four days by the addition of 1 mM cupric sulfate to the culture media. After expression, conditioned supernatants containing the secreted HA protein were clarified at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The HA protein was purified through a multi-step process including chromatographies on copper-charged Fast Flow Sepharose (GE Bio) using elution with 50 mM imidazole, lentil lectin agarose (Vector Labs) using elution with 0.5 M alpha-methly-D-mannoside, and, finally, anion exchange in DE53 resin (Whatman) at pH 8.8 with elution in 50-100 mM NaCl. The eluted samples were concentrated and buffers exchanged after each chromatography step using filtration spin-cartridges with 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices, Millipore). Protein yield and purity were determined using the Pierce Coomassie Protein assay reagent with a bovine serum albumin standard, and Western blotting with comparison to commercially prepared standards of full-length A/Wyoming/ 03/2003 HA glycoprotein (a kind gift of Dr. Joseph A. Rininger, Protein Science Corporation). A mock preparation of the HA ectodomain protein was produced using the above expression and purification methods, and stably transformed S2 cells containing the empty pMT-BiP vector lacking the HA gene for use as a negative control in immunization experiments.",

Group 1 (n = 4, each) guinea pigs were immunized subcutaneously with the mock prepared negative control protein, and served as a negative control.

Initial experimental design also included a comparison of increasing antigen load to study how the animals responded to increasing concentrations of antigen. This was an attempt to scale the amount of recombinant HA protein to that which would be presented by natural infection. Animals in Group 3 were immunized three times with 10 micrograms each, and then given a final boost of 40 micrograms at 10 weeks post-prime. Group 4 animals were immunized three times with 30 micrograms of recombinant HA, with a final boost of 40 micrograms.

Group serum pools (1:750 dilution) were analyzed for recognition of linear epitopes by reactivity to overlapping peptides bound to microtiter plates. The black bars indicate the magnitude of the ELISA reactivity as a measure of Optical Density (O.D.) for the recognition of specific peptides. Sequential bleeds were tested from the prebleed (A) and 3 (B), 5 (C), and 12 (D) weeks after the initial immunization. Reactivity to the peptides was compared between the three groups to identify potential linear epitopes. Group 1: mock immunized negative control group (left column), Group 3: lower dose HAimmunized (center), Group 4: higher dose HA-immunized (right column).",
