Main pathological alteration was acute hepatitis with extensive bridging necrosis, reactive hepatocyte proliferation, and mild to moderate inflammatory response with monocyte/macrophage activation. Virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas. Ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro by $3 log units (IC 50 0.6-2.8 mg/ml; IC 90 1.2-4.7 mg/ml). Ribavirin [100 mg/(kg6d)] did not increase the survival rate of IFNAR 2/2 mice, but prolonged the time to death (p,0.001) and reduced the aminotransferase levels and the virus titers. Arbidol [150 mg/(kg6d)] had no efficacy in vivo. Animals treated with T-705 at 1 h [15, 30, and 300 mg/(kg6d)] or up to 2 days [300 mg/(kg6d)] post infection survived, showed no signs of disease, and had no virus in blood and organs. Co-administration of ribavirin and T-705 yielded beneficial rather than adverse effects.",

The virus is endemic in Africa, Asia, southeast Europe, and the Middle East. Hyalomma ticks transmit the virus to humans, wildlife, and livestock. Humans may also be infected by contact with infected livestock. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly in the hospital setting. In humans, the virus causes a febrile illness that may be associated with hemorrhage, liver necrosis, shock, and multiorgan failure. Further hallmarks of the disease are increased levels of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT, respectively), thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The average case fatality rate is 30-50%, but may be higher in nosocomial outbreaks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

Endothelial and liver cell damage, induction of proinflammatory cytokines, and dysregulation of the coagulation cascade are thought to play a role [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Studies on the pathophysiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been hampered by the lack of an appropriate animal model, as no mammal with fully functional immune system has been described so farexcept humans -that develops disease upon infection. The first animal model was neonatal mouse [9] . Recently, two transgenic mouse models for CCHF have been described, first, mice lacking the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1 2/2 mice) and second, mice lacking the type I (alpha/beta) interferon receptor (IFNAR 2/2 mice) [10] [11] [12] . Both knockout mice are defective in the innate immune response, die rapidly from CCHFV infection, and reproduce relevant aspects of human CCHF. Surrogate models for CCHF employ IFNAR 2/2 mice infected with Dugbe or Hazara virus [13, 14] , two CCHFV-related nairoviruses that are not known to cause disease in human. Work with these models can be carried out at biosafety level (BSL)-2, while work with infectious CCHFV requires BSL-4 facilities.",

Furthermore, we employed this model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 (favipiravir) against CCHFV in vivo. These drugs are either in clinical use or in an advanced stage of clinical testing. Ribavirin inhibits CCHFV replication in cell culture [15] and is administered to CCHF patients, though its clinical benefit is not proven and discussed controversially [16] [17] [18] [19] . It shows beneficial effects in the neonatal and STAT1 2/2 mouse models [9, 10] . Ribavirin currently is the only drug available for treatment of CCHF. Arbidol is a broadspectrum antiviral showing activity against a range of RNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, most notably influenza A virus [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In Russia and China, the drug is in clinical use primarily for prophylaxis and treatment of acute respiratory infections including influenza. Arbidol is assumed to act via hydrophobic interactions with membranes and virus proteins, thus inhibiting viral fusion and entry [25] [26] [27] . T-705 is a potent inhibitor in vitro and in animal models of influenza virus, phleboviruses, hantaviruses, arenaviruses, alphaviruses, picornaviruses, and norovirus [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Following conversion to T-705-ribofuranosyl-59-triphosphate, it presumably acts as a nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . T-705 (favipiravir) is currently in late stage clinical development for the treatment of influenza virus infection.",

Studies on pathophysiology and treatment of CCHF have been hampered by the lack of an appropriate animal model. We have employed CCHF virus-infected transgenic mice, which are defective in the innate immune response, as a disease model. These mice die from the infection and show signs of disease similar to those found in humans. First, we studied the liver pathology in the animals, as hepatic necrosis is a prominent feature of human CCHF. Secondly, we used the model to test the efficacy of antiviral drugs that are in clinical use or in an advanced stage of clinical testing. Besides ribavirin, the standard drug for treatment of CCHF, we tested arbidol, a drug in clinical use against respiratory infections, and T-705, a new drug in clinical development for the treatment of influenza virus infection. While ribavirin and arbidol showed some or no beneficial effect, respectively, T-705 was highly efficacious in the animal model. These data hold promise for clinical efficacy of T-705 in human CCHF. concentrations c = 0; IC 90 /8; IC 90 /4; IC 90 /2; IC 90 ; IC 90 N2; IC 90 N4; IC 90 N8 in all possible combinations (c x ,c y ). The IC 90 values were derived from the prior single-drug experiments. The drug combination data were analyzed using the Bliss independence drug interaction model [44] . This model is defined by the equation E xy = E x +E y 2(E x NE y ), where E xy is the additive effect of drugs x and y as predicted by their individual effects E x and E y . E x = (-V obs (0,0)2V obs (c x ,0))/V obs (0,0) and E y = (V obs (0,0)2V obs (0,c y ))/V obs (0,0), where V obs (c x ,c y ) is the observed, i.e. experimentally determined virus titer for (c x ,c y ). In analogy to the MacSynergy II program [44, 45] , which evaluates antivirus data according to the Bliss independence model, a three-dimensional approach was used to identify areas where observed effects are greater (synergy) or less (antagonism) than those predicted by E xy . To this end, the ratio between predicted virus titer V pred (c x ,c y ) = V obs (0,0)N(12E xy ) and observed virus titer V obs (c x ,c y ) was calculated for each drug combination (c x ,c y ). A ratio .1 indicates synergy (i.e. for (c x ,c y ) the virus titer predicted for additive effect is higher than the experimentally determined virus titer), a ratio ,1 indicates antagonism (i.e. for (c x ,c y ) the virus titer for predicted additive effect is lower than the experimentally determined virus titer).",

Six to twelve-week-old female animals (weight median 20 g, range 15-24 g) were used for all experiments, except of nine males that were used for determination of the lethal virus dose. A group size of 5 animals was expected to provide sufficiently accurate estimates of survival rate, viremia, and clinical chemistry parameters. It allows to detect an 80% difference in survival rate between control and treatment group with p (alpha) = 0.05 and power (1 -beta) = 0.8. Experimental groups were age-matched. Three to five animals of a group were kept together in a conventional cage without enrichments. They had ad libitum access to food and water. Infection experiments with CCHFV were performed in the animal facility of the BSL-4 laboratory with artificial light/dark cycles.",

To this end, IFNAR 2/2 mice were infected i.p. with 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 FFU. Animals died from the infection even after inoculation with 0.3 FFU (inoculum, died/ infected: 0.3 FFU, 4/5; 1 FFU, 5/5; 3 FFU, 4/5; 10 FFU, 6/8; 100 FFU 13/13; 1,000 FFU, 8/8; 10,000 FFU, 3/3). This indicates that only a few infectious virus particles of CCHFV strain Afg09-2990 are sufficient to initiate a productive infection. A lethal outcome was consistently observed with $100 FFU.

Top: Liver was collected (i) from na\u00efve animals (ii) from animals that succumbed to the infection without treatment at day 3 p.i., (iii) that succumbed to the infection at day 9 p.i. following ribavirin treatment with 100 mg/(kg6d), and (iv) that were euthanized at day 3 p.i. during T-705 treatment with 300 mg/(kg6d).

Bottom: Spleen was collected from na\u00efve animals and animals that succumbed to the infection without treatment at day 3 p.i. Sections were stained with H&E and the distribution of CCHFV in the tissue was visualized using a monoclonal antibody against CCHFV NP.

Both values were higher in the 10,000 FFU group (AST 1,600 U/l and ALT 500 U/l) (Fig. 1) . AST and ALT elevations indicated cell damage, in particular of liver cells. At day 2, virus titer in blood ranged from below detection lime in the 10 FFU group, via 3 log 10 FFU/ml in the 100 and 1,000 FFU groups, up to 5 log 10 FFU/ml in the 10,000 FFU group (Fig. 1) .

Although one animal survived after treatment, ribavirin did not significantly increase the survival rate (p = 0.4). However, the drug prolonged the time to death (median 3 vs. 6 days for placebo vs. ribavirin, p = 0.0007), reduced the levels of AST (p = 0.001) and ALT (p = 0.006) at day 2, reduced the virus titer in blood at day 2 (p = 0.0007), increased the weight at day 2 and 3 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.002, respectively), and reduced the terminal virus concentration in all organs when compared to placebo at day 3 (p,0.001 separately for each organ). Histopathological analysis of organs collected at day 3 from ribavirin-treated mice revealed only small disseminated foci of necrosis; most of the liver parenchyma resembled na\u00efve mice. Markedly reduced hepatocellular necrosis correlated with low numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes (cleaved caspase-3), T-cells (CD3), B-cells (B220), and activated monocytederived cells (iNOS). Virus antigen-positive cells (NP) were significantly reduced in liver and spleen compared to untreated or placebo-treated mice (data not shown). However, ribavirintreated mice that succumbed to infection on days 4-9 showed extensive bridging hepatocellular necrosis at the time of death (Fig. 2) . Like in untreated mice, the necrosis was accompanied by presence of numerous Iba-1-positive macrophages (Kupffer cells), showing enlarged cell bodies and focal clustering, and iNOSexpressing activated monocyte-derived cells (Fig. 3) . Both alterations are suggestive for strong monocyte/macrophage activation. However, in contrast to untreated mice, virus antigen was hardly detectable in liver tissue of the treated mice (Fig. 2) , consistent with the low virus titer in all organs (Fig. 5, bottom) . Thus, ribavirin reduces CCHFV load and delays disease progression, but it does not prevent terminal liver necrosis, monocyte/macrophage activation, and lethal outcome in the IFNAR 2/2 mouse model.",

The 868 concentration matrix was designed around the IC 90 values of both drugs as determined above. Infectious virus particles were measured 3 days p.i. by immunofocus assay and cell viability was determined by the MTT method.

            "text": "It has been shown very recently that the IFNAR 2/2 model mimics hallmarks of human CCHF disease [12] . These findings are extended here by a more detailed immunhistopathological analysis of the liver. Histopathology, virus load measurement, antigen staining in various organs, and the measurement of AST and ALT demonstrate that the liver is the major target organ of CCHFV. Although virus was found in all organs, the titer in liver is the highest and exceeds 7 log 10 FFU/g in some experiments. The higher virus titer in liver compared to other organs may explain why the IHC analysis for virus antigen revealed clearly positive cells only in the liver, while the signals in other organs were weak or absent. In exceptional cases, AST and ALT values reached 10,000 U/l and 1,000 U/l, respectively, demonstrating massive liver cell damage. However, while ALT is specific for this organ, AST is also present at high level in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells [50] . Therefore, the high AST/ALT ratio may also indicate extrahepatic cell damage. Overall, the histological and biochemical findings are compatible with the diagnosis of a fulminant liver damage. Our findings are also in agreement with the pathological observations in human CCHF; hepatocellular necrosis with hyperplastic and hypertrophic Kupffer cells and mild or absent inflammatory cell infiltrates is the prominent histopathological finding in humans [3] . Two new aspects, which may provide some clues as to the pathophysiology of CCHF, are noteworthy. First, in the necrotic lesions of the liver, both CCHFV-infected hepatocytes and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered. This may suggest that CCHFV-infected cells undergo apoptosis and necrosis. As the inflammatory response was only mild to moderate, a direct cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes may be involved in the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Importantly, this hypothesis has been raised in early IHC studies on humans with CCHF as well [3] . Secondly, activated Iba-1-positive macrophages and activated monocyte-derived cells expressing iNOS were found in the liver. These cells may play a crucial role in the strong proinflammatory immune responses following CCHFV infection, as demonstrated by significant increases of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemoattractant molecules in IFNAR 2/2 and STAT1 2/2 mice, as well as in humans [6] [7] [8] 10, 12] .",

Arbidol hydrochloride efficiently suppressed CCHFV in cell culture. However, no beneficial effects in the IFNAR 2/2 mouse model were observed. The drug was administered via the same route but at higher dose than in previous studies that showed beneficial effects against influenza A, coxsackie B, and hantaan virus in mice [20, 22] . The compound had significant toxicity at higher concentrations in cell culture. It is conceivable that its antiviral effect in vitro is at least partially attributable to general cell toxic effects that are not detected in the MTT assay used to assess cell viability. Therefore, it might be that the in vitro data overestimate the true antiviral effect of the drug against CCHFV. In addition, arbidol is extremely hydrophobic, which may reduce its oral bioavailability in mice. It might be worth testing arbidol in pharmaceutical formulations with enhanced solubility in future [51] .",

This compound has been shown to be highly active against a range of viruses in vitro and in vivo, including orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses of the genera hantavirus and phlebovirus [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, its activity against CCHFV, a bunyavirus of the genus nairovirus, is not unexpected. However, in view of the low or lacking potency of ribavirin and arbidol in vivoboth of which have almost the same IC 50 and IC 90 values than T-705 -the high in vivo potency of T-705 is surprising. The IC 50 for CCHFV is 5-30 times lower than the IC 50 values for other bunyaviruses [35] , which may indicate that this virus is particularly sensitive to T-705. Even if it was given 2 days before the expected time of death, the animals survived and hardly showed signs of disease. If given immediately post-exposure, the drug suppresses virus replication below the level required to elicit antibodies. We could reduce the dose by a factor of 20 [from 300 to 15 mg/(kg6d)] with the drug still showing post-exposure efficacy.",

In analogy to other segmented negative strand viruses, T-705ribofuranosyl-59-triphosphate may be incorporated into the nascent RNA strand and inhibit further strand extension or induce lethal mutagenesis [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . How ribavirin acts against CCHFV is still not known, although the drug is in clinical use since decades. Several mechanisms have been proposed for other viruses: it may be incorporated into the virus RNA causing lethal mutagenesis [52] , interfere with capping [53] , inhibit the viral RNA polymerase [54, 55] or inhibit the host cell enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) resulting in reduced GTP levels [56] [57] [58] . T-705-ribofuranosyl-59-monophosphate was 150 times weaker than ribavirin-59-monophosphate in its IMPDH inhibitory effect, suggesting that IMPDH is not a major target enzyme for T-705 [39, 40] . Given that the mode of action of both drugs is poorly understood, it is difficult to predict how they interact. However, as ribavirin is the standard drug for treatment of CCHF [16] [17] [18] [19] , a ribavirin/T-705 combination treatment would be an obvious option in clinical practice. Our experiments suggest that both drugs do not act in an antagonistic manner in vitro and in vivo. According to the Bliss independence model there is even evidence for synergistic interaction in vitro and the experiments in the animal model point to a beneficial rather than adverse interaction in vivo. In conclusion, our data hold promise for clinical efficacy of T-705 or ribavirin/T-705 combination treatment in human CCHF.",

Animals were inoculated i.p. with 100 FFU of CCHFV. Top: Liver was collected (i) from na\u00efve animals (ii) from animals that succumbed to the infection without treatment at day 3 p.i., (iii) that succumbed to the infection at day 9 p.i. following ribavirin treatment with 100 mg/(kg6d), and (iv) that were euthanized at day 3 p.i. during T-705 treatment with 300 mg/(kg6d). Treatment with ribavirin or T-705 was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. Bottom: Spleen was collected from na\u00efve animals and animals that succumbed to the infection without treatment at day 3 p.i. Sections were stained with H&E and the distribution of CCHFV in the tissue was visualized using a monoclonal antibody against CCHFV NP. Histopathological findings are representative for 2-3 animals that were analyzed per group. Scale bar = 50 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002804.g002",

Concentration in cell culture supernatant of infectious virus particles was measured 2-4 days p.i. by immunofocus assay. Cell growth and viability under compound treatment was determined by the MTT method. Dose-response curves were fitted to the data. The graphs show representative experiments with data points representing mean and standard deviation of $3 replicates.
