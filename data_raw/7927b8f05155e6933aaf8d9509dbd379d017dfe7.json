            "text": "Background: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis, infects swine of all ages causing vomiting and diarrhea, in newborn piglets the mortality rate is near 100%. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. Results: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.",

            "text": "Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus, can cause watery diarrhea, vomiting, and rapid dehydration. Infection with TGEV results in nearly 100% mortality in neonatal piglets [1, 2] , and is responsible for enormous economic losses in the swine industry [3] . TGEV is an enveloped virus with a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 4 structural proteins: spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein protein (N) [4, 5] . The structure of the S glycoprotein changes radically as it binds to specific epithelial cell receptors and mediates the fusion of cellular and viral membranes [5] [6] [7] [8] . Significant effort has been made to characterize the cellular receptors for TGEV infection. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), also known as CD13, has been identified as a primary cell-surface receptor for TGEV [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Our laboratory recently reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of TGEV [14] . TGEV may use a third protein (200 kDa), currently uncharacterized, for cell entry [15, 16] . Identification of this receptor would provide additional insight into TGEV-mediated disease and define a novel therapeutic target for protecting swine from TGEV infection.",

            "text": "TfR1 is a homo-dimeric type II transmembrane glycoprotein with two apparent 100 KDa subunits (total 200 KDa). TfR1 contains a large extracellular C-terminal domain (671 amino acids, includes a binding site for its ligand transferrin), a single transmembrane domain (28 amino acids), and a short intracellular N-terminal domain (61 amino acids) [17] [18] [19] . In normal intestinal epithelium, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1/CD71) is predominantly expressed in the crypt enterocytes (observed on the basolateral surface and in the cytoplasm of crypt epithelial cells) [20] [21] [22] , with little expression in the epithelial cells at the apical of the villus. In contrast, under conditions of iron-deficiency anemia and low iron stores, the iron-responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/ IRP) network prevents TfR1 mRNA degradation [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and up-regulates TfR1 substantially, resulting in expression all across the intestinal epithelium [18, 28, 29] . In addition to its functions in iron uptake and homeostatic maintenance of the intestinal epithelium [18, 20, 30] , TfR1 had also been identified as a cellular entry receptor for several viruses, including the New World arenaviruses, New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, Machupo virus (MACV) [31, 32] , mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) [33, 34] , the canine and feline parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus [35, 36] , and hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [37] . Additionally, Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) uses TfR1 as a cellular receptor for entry into susceptible cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [38] .",

To test this hypothesis, we used cultured porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), derived from the neonatal piglet mid-jejunum [39, 40] , as a model to characterize the interaction between TfR1 and TGEV in vitro. Our results indicate that TfR1 serves as a receptor for TGEV, contributes specifically to virion binding and endocytosis, and determines TGEV tropism.",

Fluorescence was significantly decreased at 1 h p.i. in blocked cells (Fig. 3a) . At 24 h p.i., western blotting showed that expression of TGEV-N protein was significantly lower in IPEC-J2 cells that had been pre-incubated with anti-TfR1 Ab (Fig. 3b and c) . In contrast, TGEV invasion was not affected by treatment with the TfR1 ligands holo-Tf or apo-Tf (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Ferristatin II, a TfR1 inhibitor that causes degradation of TfR1 (34) , was used to confirm the role of TfR1 in TGEV invasion. Preliminary experiments showed that a 50 \u03bcM dose of ferristatin II did not result in detectable cytotoxicity (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ).

TGEV-N mRNA levels were also significantly lower in TfR1 knockdown cells at 1 h p.i. (Fig. 3h) . To determine whether TfR1 knockdown affects TGEV replication in IPEC-J2 cells, we used immunofluorescence staining to detect changes in TGEV-N protein levels. TGEV-N protein was obviously reduced in cells treated with the TfR1 knockdown shRNA at 24 h p.i., relative to cells treated with the scrambled shRNA control (Fig. 3i) .

The species-specific virus tropism or host-range is usually determined by entry receptors [42] . The intestinal epithelium of neonatal piglets is particularly susceptible to TGEV [43] . Identifying the proteins that mediate the association between the host cell and the virus is therefore a crucial step for understanding virus-host interactions. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine if TfR1 can function as a receptor for TGEV invasion. The results show that TGEV induces the internalization, clustering, and down-regulation of cellular TfR1. Overexpression of TfR1 enhances TGEV invasion, and infection by TGEV can be inhibited if access to TfR1 is blocked, or if TfR1 levels are reduced. Finally, we determined that TGEV-S1 protein interacts with the Recently, Li et al. observed that the ability of TGEV to bind MDCK cells is enhanced when the cells express porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) [44] . We found that overexpression of TfR1 in the refractory Caco-2 cell line is sufficient to allow TGEV entry, synthesis of viral RNA and protein, and release of infectious TGEV. pAPN has been shown to function as a receptor for TGEV infection [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, this protein seems to be widely distributed on enterocytes and probably on other tissues, irrespective of age [15] . An entry receptor or co-receptor usually mediates virus entry, as is the case for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and poliovirus [45] [46] [47] [48] . A 200 kDa protein that is restricted to the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs has been identified as a possible additional receptor for TGEV, and may account for the age sensitivity of these animals to the virus [15] . Newborn piglets with iron-deficiency anemia usually present elevated levels of TfR1 on the entire surface of the intestinal epithelium [18, 28, 29] .

The precipitates were examined by western blotting using anti-HA antibody and anti-TfR1 antibody (a) or anti-HA antibody and anti-GFP antibody (b) to examine the interaction between HA-TGEV-S1 and TfR1, or HA-TGEV-S1 and GFP-tagged TfR1-Out, respectively. c His-tagged TfR1-Out was expressed in E.coli BL21 and purified using a Ni-NTA column. Purified products were separated using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. d Purified TfR1-Out was verified by western blotting. e and f IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV (MOI 5) were pre-incubated with TfR1-Out (200 ng/mL) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and cell lysates were harvested for western blotting. The ratio of TGEV-N to GAPDH was normalized to control conditions, and culture supernatants were collected for viral plaque assays in ST cells. Plaques developed 2 days after infection. Normal cells and cells treated with pET-32a-c(+) served as controls. Data shown are means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.

JUNV also uses TfR1 as a cellular receptor for entry into Vero cells and is rapidly internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [49] , and canine parvovirus (CPV) utilizes limited TfR1 clustering on the surface to enter host cells through the clathrin endocytic pathway [36, 50] . Studies in our laboratories have demonstrated that EGFR is another promoter for TGEV entry via the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway [14] . Upon binding to its ligand holo-Tf (iron-bound transferrin), TfR1 that is associated with clathrin-coated pits of the plasma membrane is internalized by dynamin-mediated endocytosis. The small GTPase Rab12, and its upstream activator Dennd 3, regulate membrane trafficking of TfR from recycling endosomes to lysosomes [51] . We observed that a decrease in TfR1 expression follows TGEV invasion. We hypothesize that the decrease occurs because TfR1 is degraded by lysosomes after binding to TGEV, and that TfR1 plays a critical role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of TGEV.",

Trimers of S molecules form the surface spikes on coronaviruses which mediate virus entry and is a primary determinant tissue tropism cells [7, 52] . The ectodomain of the S protein consists of an N-terminal variable domain called S1 that is responsible for receptor binding, and a C-terminal conserved domain called S2 that is responsible for fusion. [8, 44, 53] . The TGEV-S1 protein interacts with pAPN and EGFR [53, 54] . In our study, we demonstrated that TGEV interacts with endogenous TfR1 and that TGEV-S1 protein interacts with TfR1 and the extracellular region of TfR1. The extracellular region of TfR1 is located between amino acid residues 90-760. Our experiments confirmed that pre-incubating TGEV with endogenous TfR1 or soluble TfR1-Out blocked viral invasion, supporting the hypothesis that these extracellular amino acids residues are important for the recognition of TGEV S1. In addition, the anti-TfR1 antibody used in our blocking experiments recognizes amino acid residues 1-100 of TfR1. This reagent also blocks TGEV invasion, presumably by occluding the site at which TGEV binds to TfR1. In contrast, neither holo-Tf nor apo-Tf interfered with the ability of TGEV to infect IPEC-J2 cells, indicating the use of non-overlapping binding sites. Based on these results, we hypothesize that TfR1 amino acid residues 90-100 encode the binding site for S1 protein.",
