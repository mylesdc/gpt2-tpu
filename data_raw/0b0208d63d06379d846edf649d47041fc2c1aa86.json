The first epidemic occurred in the spring of 2013 in eastern China [1, 2] , while the second epidemic occurred over the winter of 2013-14 in eastern and southern China. As of 12 January 2015, there have been 490 laboratory-confirmed cases of human H7N9 infection and 188 deaths while the detection of a small number of mild cases in sentinel surveillance system implies that the true number of human infections is likely to be much greater than the reported laboratory-confirmed cases [3] . More than 80% of the confirmed H7N9 cases reported exposure to live poultry or a live poultry market (LPM) prior to symptom onset [1] . Because the H7N9 virus has low pathogenicity in poultry, unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, it is challenging to control the transmission of H7N9 from poultry to humans. LPMs were closed in the cities with H7N9 cases reported and/or environmental specimens testing positive for H7N9 during the spring 2013 and winter 2013-14 epidemics. Permanent closure of LPMs has been proposed in some of the cities affected by H7N9 [4, 5] .",

Given the geographical differences observed in laboratory-confirmed cases in the two H7N9 waves, in this study we aimed to investigate patterns and changes in live poultry exposure, risk perceptions and attitudes towards H7N9, and preventive interventions adopted by the public in rural and urban areas of Guangdong province in southern China which was heavily affected during the winter 2013-14 epidemic.",
