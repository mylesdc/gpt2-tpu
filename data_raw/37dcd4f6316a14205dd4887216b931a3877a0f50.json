The authors demonstrate that the intranasal infection of pigs results in typical clinical signs of PEDV, and provide insight on the possible role of dendritic cells in the nasal cavity to transfer virus to T lymphocytes that then possibly work as carriers to the active site of infection (intestines). The aerosol transmission of PEDV has been previously speculated as an important factor to disseminate the virus. However, although PEDV was found in aerosol particles, transmission and active replication was not demonstrated in previous studies. This manuscript provides novel evidence to the mechanism in which PEDV could reach the active site of replication if infection was not initiated by the oral route. The methodology was thorough and well performed, but clarity needs to be improved for parts of the methods and most of the results/figures. Specific comments are mentioned below.",

These results are crucial to confirm the ability of T lymphocytes to transfer PEDV to intestinal cells, as they are a host-specific cell line and provide results that can be better extrapolated to what happens in vivo than Vero cells. Also, for the NEC-DC and DC-T cell co-culture studies, were there controls to compare the direct infection of DC and T lymphocytes? Does it result in higher percentage of infected cells if they are directly infected? The authors mention that large amounts of virus were transferred from infected Vero cells to T cells. Is this a hypothesis for the higher virus titers in the supernatant of the transfer experiment at 96hrs? Please explain.",

Abbreviations are used extensively and loosely. Some were not described at all (e.g. PID, TEER in the supplementary figure only).

In additional studies, IPEC-J2 did not appear to be susceptible to PEDV, consistent with the previous reports 1 . After PEDV infection, no infectious virus particles were released in the cell culture supernatant (Fig.   R2A ), and the viral RNA and protein in IPEC-J2 cells gradually disappeared over time ( Fig. R2B and C) . We did not think that IPEC-J2 could be used as an appropriate cell model for transfer infection experiments. Therefore, these results were not included in the article. We will also delete the corresponding content in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript. Additionally, we conducted experiments to study PEDV infection in T cells. A higher percentage of PEDV + CD3 + T cells (Fig. R3B ) was detected in the direct infection group compared with that in the DC/T coculture system (Fig. 6C ). If you find it necessary, we will add this result to the manuscript; we would appreciate your suggestions. h of coculture, particularly in the contact group, and as much as 51.9% of PEDV + CD3 + T cells were detected. However, our data are insufficient to confirm the conclusion about large amounts of virus were transferred from infected Vero cells to T cells. We need apologize for our hasty conclusion. We have conducted a complementary experiment to prove that PEDV could be transferred from infected Vero cells to T cells (Fig.   R4 ). If you find it necessary, we will include the relevant information in the revised manuscript as supplementary material. We appreciate your useful suggestion. Thanks. A: I apologize for our mistake.

            "text": ": A novel pathway of virus dissemination within the host: spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa in swine. Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): The manuscript \"A novel pathway of virus dissemination within the host: spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa in swine\" describes an alternative possible pathogenesis route by which Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV) can result in active infection. The authors demonstrate that the intranasal infection of pigs results in typical clinical signs of PEDV, and provide insight on the possible role of dendritic cells in the nasal cavity to transfer virus to T lymphocytes that then possibly work as carriers to the active site of infection (intestines). The aerosol transmission of PEDV has been previously speculated as an important factor to disseminate the virus. However, although PEDV was found in aerosol particles, transmission and active replication was not demonstrated in previous studies. This manuscript provides novel evidence to the mechanism in which PEDV could reach the active site of replication if infection was not initiated by the oral route. The methodology was thorough and well performed, but clarity needs to be improved for parts of the methods and most of the results/figures. Specific comments are mentioned below. Thank you very much for your approval and opinions. These suggestions will be helpful in improving the quality of our manuscript. We will answer your specific questions individually, perform the relevant experiments and correct a series of errors in the manuscript. All the changes we made are labeled with red font in the revised manuscript. Q1. Porcine jejunum epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) is mentioned for the transfer experiment methods, but results are not shown. These results are crucial to confirm the ability of T lymphocytes to transfer PEDV to intestinal cells, as they are a host-specific cell line and provide results that can be better extrapolated to what happens in vivo than Vero cells. A: I apologize for the missing results. Actually, we used the porcine jejunum epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) for the transfer infection experiment.",

Also, for the NEC-DC and DC-T cell co-culture studies, were there controls to compare the direct infection of DC and T lymphocytes? Does it result in higher percentage of infected cells if they are directly infected? A: Thanks very much for your helpful suggestion. We have performed relevant experiments to study the direct infection of DCs. A supplementary experiment showed that compared with the NECM/DCs coculture system, PEDV direct infection resulted in a higher percentage of PEDV + DCs (Fig. R3A). This result could be due to the epithelial barrier in the NECM/DCs coculture system in which DCs used tight junction proteins to penetrate the epithelium and capture PEDV. Our results are consistent with previous report 5 .",

Q3: The authors mention that large amounts of virus were transferred from infected Vero cells to T cells. Is this a hypothesis for the higher virus titers in the supernatant of the transfer experiment at 96hrs? Please explain. A: I apologize for the confusing statement. Because the coculture system contained both T and Vero cells, high virus titers in the supernatant was not enough to conclude that PEDV could be transferred to T cells. We speculated that large amounts of virus were transferred from infected Vero cells to T cells based on the flow cytometry analysis results in Fig. 7F. In the T/Vero coculture system, 3% PEDV + CD3 + T cells were detected in both the contact and noncontact groups at the original stage. A larger number of PEDV-positive T cells appeared in both groups after 96",

(A) Schematic of the model to study transmission of PEDV from Vero cells to CD3 + T cells. 70% confluent Vero cells were inoculated with PEDV at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 37\u2103. The unattached virus were removed and fresh growth medium was added. Infected Vero cells were continued to incubate at 37\u2103 for 6 h and washed with PBS (pH7.2 at 4 \u00b0C) three times to remove unattached virus.

Q4: Overall the manuscript is well written, but I believe it would be benefited if edited for proper grammar and spelling. Some examples are listed below: L98: Replace \"are possessing\" by possess.

L146-147: were detected in the jejunum and ileum at higher levels than in other tissues. L149: nasal mucosa of piglets were isolated at different time points after intranasal infection. L158-160: in which most DCs and other lymphocytes accumulated. L189: Remove while. The word was used unnecessarily in additional sentences in the manuscript. L216: After 12h post administration of PEDV. By using the expression \"for 12h\" seems that the infection lasted 12h. A4: Thanks very much for your helpful suggestions and careful review. We have modified all the mistakes in our manuscript according to your suggestions. Moreover, a native English language editing institute has been commissioned to edit our article. The grammar, spelling, and punctuation have been verified and corrected where needed and are labeled in yellow font in the revised manuscript. The certificate of English language editing has been attached to the supplementary materials. Q5: The methodology and presentation of results are often confusing, mostly due to the excessive use of abbreviations, poorly described figures, or lack of descriptive details. The figures and results contradict the methods section at times. This could be an obstacle for reproducibility of the work. Some examples are given below: A5: Thanks for your helpful suggestion. We have carefully checked the manuscript, including the methods, figure legends and results. We have corrected the contradicting sections and added more details in the revised manuscript. Thanks! 1) L106-107: Following sacrifice for macroscopic examination at PIDs 3. Was this at 3 days post infection? If so, there was no mention that animals were euthanized at 3 days post-infection. Overall, the initial experiment for clinical signs (oral and nasal inoculation) was not well described. A: I apologize for the missing details. We have added the detailed information regarding piglet sacrifice in the \"Materials and Methods\" section. Moreover, the clinical signs of piglets after PEDV inoculation (oral and nasal) were rewritten in the revised manuscript to provide a more detailed description. 2) The methods for the co-culture of NEC and DC are not complete of how NEC were collected and the procedure for infection, most of the information is only mentioned on the figure legend but is not necessarily clear. A: Thanks for your suggestion. I apologize for the missing details concerning NECs collection and the procedure for PEDV infection. We have added specific information about these procedures in the \"Materials and Methods\" section of the revised manuscript. Q6: Abbreviations are used extensively and loosely. Some were not described at all (e.g. PID, TEER in the supplementary figure only). And even those that were mentioned previously, if not commonly known or extensively repeated in the manuscript, the meaning should be reinforced. Some are mentioned in the methods section but will need to be mentioned in the results too. Because of the way the manuscript is structured (results before the methods), I believe it would be more clear and easier to follow results if before displaying the findings, a brief explanation was given of why a particular assay was done. A6: Thanks for your helpful suggestions. We have modified all of the abbreviations used in the revised manuscript. Moreover, we have added a brief explanation about a particular assay before displaying the findings. Q7: The targets and reason of antibodies/ markers used should be mentioned when describing antibodies, assuming the reader will not be familiar with all of them. A7: Thanks for your suggestion. We have added the targets and reasons for using antibodies/ markers in the \"Materials and Methods\" section. Q8: The 1h time point shown for the PEDV infection/transmission is confusing. The methods describe co-culture for 2h. Please describe timepoints in figure legends more clearly. A8: I apologize for our carelessness. For analysis of transmission of DCassociated PEDV to T cells, PEDV transmission was quantified after coculture for 2 h. We have added the timepoint to the figure legends of Fig. 6C and corrected the time point in related figures. However, for better observation of conjugate formation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), PEDV-pulsed DC-T-cell mixtures were centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 1 min to facilitate conjugate formation and cultured for 1 h at 37\u00b0C as previously described 6 . We have also corrected the time point in the legend of Fig. 6H and the related section in the Materials and Methods. Q9: Figures: Legends are not clear, it is necessary to re-check methods and text frequently to understand figures. What is shown in the figures should be more clearly explained. In several instances, the panels are too small and difficult to visualize, most frequently for fluorescent staining. A: I apologize for the unclear figure description and presentation. We have checked all of the figure legends and corrected the unclear presentation. Furthermore, we enlarged small figures such as Fig 4. B and F, Fig. 5H, Fig. 6G, Fig. 7C and D for better visualization.
