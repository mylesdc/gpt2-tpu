As a result, \u03bd \u039b \u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u039b seg,\u03b1\u03b2 . Moreover, one can show that \u039b seg,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b4 \u03b2,seg (1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1,seg ). The term \u03bd \u0393 \u03bd\u03b1 is the probability of \u03b1 generating a \u03bd = seg by infecting a susceptible. This is just the probability of transmitting the wt, because all the other probabilities cancel out. Hence, \u03bd \u0393 \u03bd\u03b1 = \u03bb(1\u2212\u03b4 \u03b1,seg ).

The estimate of the critical surfaces requires computing the endemic states, corresponding to the different phases. To do that, we used the quasistationary state method [2, 3] . In its original formulation for an SIS model, the quasistationary state method relies on forcing the system out of the disease-free state. Every time the simulation produces a fully susceptible population, one inputs an active configuration previously visited by the system. With multipartite viruses, however, there is an additional challenge, represented by the fact that the disease-free state is not the only absorbing state. Every time the system becomes free of a specific variant (or wt) disappears from the system, it will be free of it forever. Hence, we force the system out of any state that does not contain all the v variants and the wt. The result of the simulations is shown in Fig. S.1 . ",

Hence, for instance, while compartment wt transmits the wt with probability \u03bb, 1 transmits it with probability \u03bb/2, due to the concurrent infection by a defective variant. We show that while this impacts the specific values of the critical surfaces in Eq. (2,3,4) of the main text, it does not change the quantitative behavior.",
