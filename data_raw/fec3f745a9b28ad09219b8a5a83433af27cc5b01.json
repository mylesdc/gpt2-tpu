It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The spike protein of PEDV plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells, and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the S1 subunit, which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis. In this study, we successfully constructed an immune phage display single-domain antibody library with a library size of 3.4 \u00d7 10 6 . A single-domain antibody, named S7, specific for the spike protein of PEDV was identified from the phage display single-domain antibody library. S7 could be expressed in a soluble form in E. coli, bound to the spike protein of PEDV in ELISA and stained the PEDV virus in Vero cells, but it showed no neutralization activity on PEDV. These results indicated the potent application of the S7 antibody as an imaging probe or as a candidate for the development of a diagnostic assay.",

It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The disease was first described in Europe in the early seventies, and the PEDV virus was first isolated in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978. Since the nineties, several outbreaks have been reported in Asian countries, such as South Korea, China and Japan, and they have been characterized by relatively high mortality rates ranging from 50 to 95%, causing severe damage to the swine industry (Lee 2015; Song et al. 2015b ). In the late autumn of 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea characterized by severe watery diarrhea, dehydration with high morbidity and mortality emerged in a swine farm in southern China, and it has affected an estimated millions of piglets and greatly threatened the global swine industry. The accumulated evidence suggests that the causative agent of the disease was PEDV with a possible variation (Li et al. 2012; Song et al. 2015a; Tian et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "PEDV is a member of the family Coronaviridae and has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. PEDV mainly infects piglets and can infect several cell lines in vitro, such as Vero cells. The complete genome of PEDV comprises approximately 280,000 nucleotides (nt) with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends containing untranslated regions (UTRs). The remaining genomic sequences contain seven open reading frames (ORFs) and encode four proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein Open Access *Correspondence: jinshancao@imau.edu.cn; yanandu@126.com 1 College of Veterinary Medicine, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, No. 306, Zhaowuda Road, Saihan District, Huhhot 010018, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article (N) (Rasmussen et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2014) . The spike protein of PEDV is a type one membrane glycoprotein consisting of the N terminal S1 and C terminal S2 subunits and plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells. The spike protein contains a multidomain architecture and has been reported to bind to carbohydrate (sialic acid) and aminopeptidase N molecules in porcine cells (Li et al. 2016; Meng et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2018) . The neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were identified in recent studies, and that suggested that the epitopes were mainly located in the S1 subunit (Chang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2017) . The recombinant expressed S1 protein can also induce protective immunity in piglets (Makadiya et al. 2016; Oh et al. 2014) . These factors make the spike protein of PEDV a putative candidate for developing an efficient protective vaccine.",

The VHH fragment was amplified with a nested PCR method by using the primers listed in Table 1 . In the first round of PCR, a fragment containing the leader sequence to the CH 2 region of the IgG (900 bp for VH and 600 bp for VHH) was amplified with primers P1 and P2, and the 600 bp fragment was purified by 1% agarose gel electroporation and used as the template for the second round of PCR.

Pigs of all ages and breeds are susceptible to PEDV, and infections of suckling piglets 1-5 days old were the most serious, with the highest infection rate and mortality of 100%. The main symptoms of the disease are vomiting, severe diarrhea and dehydration. The PEDV genome is a single-stranded RNA belonging to the coronavirus family. The total length of the PEDV genome is approximately 28 Kb, containing at least 7 open reading frames (Chen et al. 2019; Nefedeva et al. 2019) . The spike protein of PEDV is composed of 1383 amino acids, including signal peptide (1-18 aa), neutralization epitopes (499-638 aa, 748-755 aa, 764-771 aa and 1368-1374 aa), transmembrane region (1334-1356 aa), and a short cytoplasmic region in the middle. The spike protein plays a key regulatory role in the binding of the virus to the receptor. It is involved in the binding to cell receptors and in membrane fusion, which can indirectly Single-domain antibodies are a unique kind of antibody that naturally lacks a light chain and the CH1 region of IgG. They are found in camelids and nurse sharks, and they possess the unique properties of small molecular size (15 kDa, 1/10 of conventional antibody), low immunogenicity, strong tissue penetrating ability, high binding affinity and good stability (Arbabi-Ghahroudi 2017; Greenberg et al. 1995; Hamers-Casterman et al. 1993 ). Due to their single-domain nature and excellent properties, sdAbs have become ideal for developing sensitive diagnostic assays, immuno-imaging probes, and immunotherapeutics, especially for infectious diseases and tumors (Beghein and Gettemans 2017; Iezzi et al. 2018; Wilken and McPherson 2018) . Considering the broad application of sdAbs on the diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases, in this study we identified and characterized a sdAb specific for the spike protein of PEDV.",

The SBP-tag is a 38-amino acid peptide and can strongly bind to streptavidin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.5 nM (Keefe et al. 2001; Yang and Veraksa 2017) . The S7 antibody was expressed in a soluble form in E. coli with a high yield, and the western blot results showed that HRP-streptavidin could bind to the purified recombinant S7 antibody fused to the SBP-tag. This simplified detection strategy may favor the application of sdAbs as detection agents in immunoassays or immuno-imaging and is similar to the use of quantum dots to label sdAbs for tracer materials (Modi et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2014) .",

ELISA results demonstrated that the S7 antibody could specifically bind to the spike protein with strong binding activity, even at a 1 \u03bcg/ml (50 pmol) concentration, demonstrating that the S7 antibody could strongly bind to the spike protein, which is in accordance with published data on sdAbs. Due to their excellent properties of smaller size, permeability and stability, sdAbs have been widely used as probes for immuno-imaging and diagnostic assays. In the present study, PEDV-infected Vero cells were stained with the S7 antibody followed by FITC-streptavidin in a direct immunofluorescence assay. The Vero cells infected with PEDV were nicely stained by the S7 antibody, and the control Vero cells without PEDV infection had no signal. These results suggest the potent application of the S7 antibody as a nanoprobe for the detection of PEDV in living cells. Unfortunately, we did not find any neutralization effects of the S7 antibody on PEDV infection in the current study, which suggests that the S7 antibody is not a suitable passive immunization agent or therapeutic antibody. The results were in accordance with the recent findings that antibodies raised by the spike protein of Fig. 3 The PEDV spike protein-specific recombinant phages were identified by phage ELISA. The recombinant phages of 96 clones that were randomly picked from the third round of panning were added to microplates coated with the PEDV spike protein, and the bound phages were detected with HRP/anti-M13 monoclonal antibody. M13K07 helper phage was used as a negative control Fig. 4 Expression and purification of the S7 antibody. The gene fragment of the S7 antibody was ligated into a modified pET-25b vector and fusion expression with SBP Tag. The recombinant S7 antibody was purified with Ni-NTA agarose and verified with HRP-streptavidin in western blot analysis. Lane M, molecular weight marker.
