Using the latter function, we here show the effect of the CRISPR-mediated pinpoint activation of endogenous expression of BST-2 (also known as tetherin), a virus restriction factor with a broad antiviral spectrum. Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences targeting the BST-2 promoter were selected by promoter assays. Potential sgRNAs and dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain, along with an accessory transcriptional activator complex, were introduced into cells by lentiviral transduction. Increased expression of BST-2 mRNA in transduced cells was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Cells in which BST-2 expression was highly enhanced showed the effective inhibition of HIV-1 production and replication even in the presence of the viral antagonist Vpu against BST-2. These findings confirm that the physiological stoichiometry between host restriction factors and viral antagonists may determine the outcome of the battle with viruses.",

Since 2002, these cell-type-dependent requirements of accessory proteins have been explained by the discovery of HIV restriction factors that are present in a cell-type dependent manner. These findings have indicated that HIV replication in cells expressing specific restriction factors can be achieved only by using viral accessory proteins to counteract them and evade their inhibitory activity through a one-on-one confrontation, such as Vif versus APOBEC3 proteins 7-10 , Vpu versus BST-2/tetherin (referred to hereafter as BST-2) 11,12 , Vpx versus SAMHD1 13,14 , and Nef versus SERINC5 15,16 .",

This suggests the importance of counteracting this restriction factor for efficient viral replication. Because several in vivo studies have implied that the stoichiometric balance between restriction factors and viral antagonists might determine disease progression 32-35 , targeting BST-2 to enhance its endogenous expression may provide new therapeutic strategies.",

We selected six different sgRNA targets against the BST-2 promoter (sgBST2#1-6) (Fig. 1A) . To identify the best sgRNA target sequences in the BST-2 promoter, we cloned its promoter into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and cotransfected HeLa cells with this promoter-indicator plasmid together with plasmids expressing sgRNA appended to the phage MS2 RNA stem loop (sgRNA-MS2 loop), as well as dCas9 fused to the herpes simplex virus transcription factor VP16 minimal activation domain termed VP64 (dCas9-VP64), and the transcription factor fusion protein that is the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from the human heat-shock factor 1 fused to the phage MS2 coat protein (MS2-p65-HSF1), and then we performed luciferase assays. The BST-2 promoter was activated by the CRISPR-dCas9 system using all six sgRNA targets, among which sgBST2#1 and #2 revealed a 30 to 40-fold activation (Fig. 1B) .

We first produced lentiviruses expressing dCas9-VP64 fusion proteins in HEK293T cells, next infected BST-2-negative HOS cells with the lentiviruses, and then selected the transduced cells with blasticidin whose resistance gene was expressed using the dCas9-VP64 vector. Next, we produced another lentivirus expressing the MS2-p65-HSF1 transcription factor fusion protein, transduced the blasticidin-selected cells with the viral vector, and selected the cells using hygromycin. Lastly, we generated a lentivirus expressing sgBST2#1 and/or sgBST2#2, and transduced the dually selected HOS cells with the viral vector and selected the cells with zeocin. By performing Western analysis, we successfully confirmed the activated expression of endogenous BST-2 protein in a polyclonal population of CRISPR-transduced HOS cells, although additive effect of two sgRNAs was not observed ( Fig. 2A) . Then, we cloned the transduced cells using limiting dilution and subjected the resultant single cell clone to real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Real-time RT-PCR showed that endogenous expression of BST-2 mRNA was drastically activated in all single cell clones (Fig. 2B) . Cell-surface BST-2 expression analyzed by flow cytometry was robustly increased in the cloned cells (Fig. 2C) . Additionally, immunofluorescence revealed a high level of intracellular expression of BST-2 in the same cells (Fig. 2D) . We conclude that this CRISPR-based system effectively activates BST-2 expression.",

            "text": "In this study, we first identified the sgRNA target sequences at the promoter regions that can activate expression of BST-2, then transduced cells with lentiviruses expressing the sgRNAs plus dCas9 together with accessory transcriptional activators and induced enhanced expression of BST-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in successful inhibition of viral production and replication. In many cases, host restriction factors that are able to inhibit HIV infection are normally counteracted by HIV accessory proteins that act as viral antagonists. It has however been shown that the outcome of the battle between the host restriction factors and viral antagonists may be determined not only by their intrinsic activities but also by their stoichiometric balance, since overexpression www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of restriction factors can relieve the blockade imposed by viral antagonists 12, 15, 16, [39] [40] [41] [42] . This is also suggested by several studies showing that the levels of expression of restriction factors are linked to disease progression after viral infections [32] [33] [34] [35] . In other words, even in the presence of virus-encoded antagonists, the more host restriction factors are expressed, the higher the chances to inactivate the viruses. Although type-I IFN can upregulate hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes that include many host restriction factors, the study of SIV-infected rhesus macaques showed that treatment with IFN\u03b1 is effective in vivo only during the acute phase of infection and rather detrimental during the chronic stage due to the enhancement of systemic inflammation 43 . Even in human studies, type-I IFNs have been reported to upregulate CCR5 44 that provides target cells for HIV-1, potentially leading to loss of CD4+ T-cells [45] [46] [47] . In this sense, it is likely that pinpoint activation of restriction factors without using IFNs might be beneficial to hosts. Indeed, our present study showed that endogenous BST-2 expression enhanced by CRISPR methods led to remarkably decreased production and multiple-round replication of HIV-1 harboring the viral antagonist Vpu, although in the case of APOBEC3G gene activation, its inhibitory effect on wild-type HIV-1 infection was weak 48 . Higher expression of BST-2 has been implicated in the growth and progression of cancers due to its ability to promote cell-to cell interactions and to activate NF-kB-mediated signal transduction pathways 49 . In this case, it may be better to avoid traditional overexpression systems using exogenous transgenes that lead to uncontrollably robust expression of target proteins, while CRISPR activation results in endogenously maximized levels of expression, reflecting a more natural mechanisms of action with physiologically relevant phenotypes in vivo 50, 51 . Also, instead of the lentiviral systems that we used in this study, adeno-associated viral vectors should be applied to the future experiments to readily prepare high-titer virus stocks and to transduce primary cells. Moreover, it may be necessary to achieve specific gene delivery of CRISPR-based vectors to the infected cells. Targeting restriction factors to enhance their endogenous expression may provide a new therapeutic strategy to combat HIV infections. By using this system, we will pursue the possibility that the CRISPR-based activation of antiviral proteins, especially in the case of BST-2, could be one of the novel therapeutic strategies for inhibiting infections and preventing of transmission with HIV-1 as well as a variety of enveloped viruses.",

The luciferase-reporter promoter construct pGL4-BST2pro was created by PCR-amplifying the BST-2 promoter sequence (SwitchGear Genomics library) using DNA extracted from HOS cells and by cloning its NheI/XhoI-digested fragment into pGL4.10[luc2] (Promega). Lentiviral plasmids, lenti dCAS-VP64_Blast (expressing dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain), lenti sgRNA(MS2)_zeo backbone (expressing sgRNA linked to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein-binding stem loop), and lenti MS2-P65-HSF1_Hygro (expressing MS2 fused to the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from human heatshock factor 1 (HSF1)) 36 were obtained from F. Zhang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, through Addgene (plasmid ID 61425, 61426, and 61427, respectively). Based on an online tool CHOPCHOP ver.2 52 that can detect the number of mismatches, specific sgRNA target sequences against BST-2 promoter were selected within 200 base pairs of the transcription start site previously mapped 38,53 by avoiding potential off-target sites with up to two mismatches (note that CRISPR-mediated control of promoter activity is highly sensitive to even a single www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ mismatch, probably due to a narrow window of target sequence 54, 55 ) . Six different oligonucleotides encoding the selected sgRNAs were individually inserted into the lenti sgRNA(MS2)_zeo backbone digested with BsmBI to generate the lentiviral sgRNA expression plasmids pLV-sgR-BST2pro-Zeo. The lentiviral packaging vector psPAX2, a vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G) expression plasmid pC-VSVg, HIV-1 Rev expression plasmid pCa-Rev, HIV-1 Tat expression plasmid pLTR-Tat, the HIV-1 proviral construct pNL4-3, its envelope glycoprotein (Env)-deficient HIV-1 proviral construct pNL-E(\u2212), and Env/Vpu-deficient construct pNL-E(\u2212)U(\u2212), pCAGGS mammalian expression plasmid have previously been described elsewhere 56, 57 . The replication-competent Vpu-deficient HIV-1 construct pNL-U(\u2212) was created by introducing a HpaI site at the vpu initiation codon of pNL4-3 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).",

(B) Cell proliferation of CRISPR-transduced H9 cells (H9-sgCtrl, closed circles; H9-sgBST2, open circles). The assay was started with 20,000 cells. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Virus replication in H9-sgCtrl (closed symbols) or H9-sgBST2 (open symbols). Cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 ) were infected with 0.1 ng of p24 antigen of either wild-type (squares) or Vpu-defective (triangles) NL4-3 viruses. Supernatants were harvested at two-tothree-day intervals, and virus replication was monitored by p24 ELISA. Data shown are representative of four independent experiments.",

To measure endogenous and transduced levels of BST-2 expression, total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells, HOS (control or transduced) cells, and H9 cells (control or transduced) using a ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep system (Promega). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with Mx3000P (Stratagene) using the QuantiTect Multiplex RT-PCR (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific primers and probes used were as follows: BST-2, 5\u2032-GAG CTT GAG GGA GAG ATC ACT AC-3\u2032/5\u2032-ATT CTC ACG CTT AAG ACC TGG TT-3\u2032/HEX-5\u2032-TCT CTT CTC AGT CGC TCC ACC TCT GC-3\u2032-black-hole quencher 1 (BHQ1); ribosomal protein L27 (RPL27), 5\u2032-CAA TCA CCT AAT GCC CAC AAG-3\u2032/5\u2032-TTC TTG CCT GTC TTG TAT CTC TC-3\u2032/Cy5-5\u2032-TCA AAC TTG ACC TTG GCC TCC CG-3\u2032-BHQ2.
