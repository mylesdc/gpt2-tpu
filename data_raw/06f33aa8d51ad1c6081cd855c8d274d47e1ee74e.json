The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 59-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA -5NCR(+), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA -3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plussense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, OPEN ACCESS Cells infected with JEV at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and collected in 500 ml cell lysis buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mg/ml aprotinin and 0.5% PTB-Mediated Inhibition of JEV Replication PLOS ONE |",

The ,11-kb genome has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 3432 amino acids that is subsequently cleaved to produce three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 (REF) . The ORF is flanked by 95-and 585-nucleotides long non-coding regions (NCRs) at the 59-and 39-ends, respectively [2] . The 39 distal region of ,100 nucleotides within the 39-NCR is predicted to form a stable stem loop (SL).

Our understanding of the role of PTB in virus replication is largely based on studies with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and picornaviruses where it is involved in IRES-mediated translation initiation [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In addition, PTB was shown to bind the 39-NCR of DENV-4 genome [14] , and both 59-and 39-NCRs of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) RNA [27] , and the protein was important for efficient virus replication [13, 28] . PTB has also been shown to bind the 39-NCR of JEV antigenome [3NCR(-)] [29] although its role in virus replication was not known. In the present study we demonstrate that PTB, in addition to binding JEV 3NCR(-) RNA, also binds 59-NCR of JEV positive-strand RNA [5NCR(+)] in vitro. We also show that nuclear PTB relocalized to cytoplasm during JEV infection where it associated with viral RNA leading to inhibition of RNA transcription and virus replication. This constitutes a novel cellular mechanism employed by the host to control JEV infection.",

JEV-infected HEK cells were lysed at 24 h post-infection (pi) and PTB-bound RNA precipitated using PTB antibody. RT-PCR of the precipitated RNA is expected to yield a 397-bp product in case it contained JEV RNA. A distinct band of expected size in the RT-PCR product was seen when PTB antibody was used for immunoprecipitation ( Fig. 2) . No amplification product was seen in the control reaction where luciferase antibody was used. While this experiment shows that JEV RNA could be interacting with PTB in vivo, it does not necessarily indicate a direct binding of the two. However, in light of direct RNA-protein binding in vitro (shown above) it may be inferred that PTB protein associated with JEV RNA during the virus infection of the cell. More evidence to this effect was provided by the experiment described below. PTB relocates to cytoplasm during JEV infection and associates with JEV RNA Flavivirus replication occurs in replication complexes located on the membranous compartments of the endoplasmic-reticulum also known as vesicle packets.

Vero cells infected with JEV 43 h after transfection with pcPTB showed small but consistent reduction in JEV titers (Fig. 6b) .

We therefore analysed the effect of PTB silencing and over-expression on JEV RNA level by performing quantitative real time RT-PCR for JEV RNA in infected Vero cells. The knockdown of PTB label and its over-expression was established by Western blotting as before.

We and others have observed by EMSA that JEV NS5 binds to the 59-NCR of the JEV genome and its complementary sequence in the antigenome. Since PTB was found to strongly interact with both these NCRs in vitro, the competitive binding of PTB and NS5 to 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) was studied by UV-induced cross-linking assay followed by RNase digestion. A constant amount of NS5 protein and increasing amount of PTB was added in a binding reaction with radiolabelled 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) RNA. The UV crosslinked RNA-protein complexes were treated with RNase A and the products were electrophoresed and autoradiographed. As shown in Fig. 8 , in the absence of any RNA-binding protein the RNA got completely digested and no band of any complex was seen. In the presence of NS5, a specific RNA-protein complex could be visualized. As the concentration of PTB increased in the binding reaction, the binding of NS5 to 5NCR(+) RNA was not affected. However, binding of NS5 with 3NCR(-) RNA was inhibited with the increasing PTB concentration and it was completely inhibited in presence of high amounts of PTB in the binding reaction. No inhibition of NS5 binding to viral RNAs was observed in presence of BSA. These data indicate that PTB can competitively inhibit NS5 binding to 3NCR(-) RNA which is important for the positive-strand RNA synthesis. These data also confirmed our earlier finding that PTB had higher affinity to 3NCR(-) RNA than to 5NCR(+). This is borne out of the empirical observation that under identical conditions 10 ng PTB showed clear binding to 3NCR(-) whereas 400 ng PTB was needed to show similar binding to 5NCR(+) (Fig. 8) .",

Following treatment with 8-bromo cAMP, cells were infected with JEV and virus titers determined. The viral titers were 50% reduced at 18 h pi and this reduction was further pronounced to 80% at 24 h pi in cAMP analogue-treated cells (Fig. 9b) .

The protein contains four RNArecognition-motif type RNA binding domains. It has been reported to stabilize cellular mRNAs by binding to NCRs for insulin [50] , vascular endothelial growth factor [51] , CD154 [52] , inducible nitric oxide synthase [53] , and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 [54] . PTB has also been shown to interact with the genome of several single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. For example, PTB interacts with the 59-NCR of Polio virus genome [55] , 59-leader RNA of Mouse hepatitis virus [56] , 39-NCR of DENV-4 [14] and DENV-2 RNA [15] , 59-and 39-NCRs of CVB3 RNA [27] , and IRES of HCV RNA [57] . PTB was previously shown to bind the JEV 3NCR(-) in vitro [29] . Using EMSA and UV-cross linking, here we show that PTB also bound to 5NCR(+) of JEV genome although it had higher affinity for 3NCR(-) RNA. That PTB indeed associated with JEV RNA during viral infection of cell was established by RNA-protein colocalization in infected cells and JEV RNA pull down using PTB antibody. The preferred RNA-binding site of PTB is a U/C tract [58] [59] [60] and it was shown to interact with a poly U sequence in the 39-NCR of HCV genomic RNA [61] . A polypyrimidine tract, CUUCUU (nucleotides 20-25 of JEV genome) exists in the 59 stem of the 59-NCR which may be involved in interaction with PTB. The JEV 3NCR(-) RNA contains the sequence UCUAA that is thought to be the putative PTB binding site [14, 56, 62] .",

PTB is reported to bind HCV RNA too, although there are conflicting reports on its effects on IRESmediated translation and virus replication [23, 24, [64] [65] [66] . To examine the role of PTB in JEV replication the protein levels were down-regulated by siRNA or upregulated by plasmid-based PTB over-expression in cultured cells where JEV replication was monitored by determining the virus titres or by studying the JEV RNA and protein levels in virus-infected cells. A significant increase in JEV titer in PTB knocked-down cells and a significant suppression of virus titer in PTB overexpressing cells showed that PTB acted as a negative regulator of JEV replication. Our studies show that PTB binds the 39-end of the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA and competes efficiently with the binding of NS5 to this end of RNA. It may be noted that binding of NS5 to the 39-end of the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA is required for the synthesis of plus-sense genomic RNA. Indeed, in PTB over-expressing cells we saw significantly reduced levels of plus-sense JEV RNA. This may contribute to suppression of JEV titers in PTB over-expressing cells. Similarly, cells with knocked-down levels of PTB showed increased levels of plus-sense JEV RNA and enhanced viral titers. These results suggest that PTB suppressed JEV replication in cells by inhibiting JEV genomic RNA synthesis. These observations were similar in both Vero and HEK cells and thus negative role of PTB in JEV replication was not cell type specific.",

Our observation is strikingly different from that seen in the case of another flavivirus, DENV-2, where PTB knock-down inhibited production of infectious virus and thus PTB was necessary for efficient virus propagation [13] . Interestingly, PTB had no role in YFV replication, another flavivirus [13] . It would, thus, appear that PTB may play varied role in RNA virus replication. Specificity of PTB function may be achieved by its interaction with additional proteins of cellular and viral origin besides its interaction with different RNA elements in different viruses.",

In case of TGEV, a coronavirus with positivestrand RNA genome, PTB has been shown to colocalize with the viral RNA in the cytoplasm [68] . In case of DENV-2 infection, PTB was shown to translocate to cytoplasm in Vero cells [15] whereas no such translocation was seen in Huh 7 cells [13, 28] . This difference was postulated to be related to the intrinsic differences between the two cells types including the fact that Vero cells did not express interferon stimulated genes [15] . It is important to note, however, that PTB translocated to the cytoplasm following JEV infection of both Vero and HEK cells, and it had inhibitory role in JEV replication in both these cells.",

In our studies, as PTB translocated to the cytoplasm during JEV infection the levels of phosphorylated PTB increased significantly. In addition, enhancement of intracellular levels of cAMP resulted in significantly suppressed JEV titers in Vero cells. In PC-12 cells, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PTB is regulated by cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA) which directly phosphorylates Ser-16 of PTB [41] . These data together suggest that JEV replication may be controlled by the host cells through PTB phosphorylation which is mediated by the cAMP-PKA activation pathway.

The recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns, including double-and single-stranded RNA, by pattern recognition receptors initiates a cascade of signalling reactions. These result in the transcriptional up regulation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce an antiviral state. IL-6 and other cytokines are synthesized by cells following the JEV infection [72, 73] . Intracellular cAMP is an important second messenger in several signalling pathways, including IL-6 response [74] [75] [76] . Our data here show that increased levels of cAMP inhibited JEV replication through PTB translocation and binding to JEV RNA. These data thus present a novel innate defence mechanism by which a host cell may be able to control the virus infection. ",

These were Western-blotted for the levels of total PTB and phosphorylated-PTB (pPTB) using rabbit phospho-Ser-16 (pS16)-specific antibody (a kind gift from Dr. J. Xie). Fold increase in the levels of pPTB at 24 h were determined by comparing the levels seen at 0 h. \u00df-Actin was used as the loading control.(b) Vero cells were incubated with 100 mM 8-bromo cAMP and 16 h later infected with JEV at a moi 1. Culture supernatants were collected 18 h and 24 h pi and JEV titers determined. Mean virus titers and standard deviation from 3 experiments are shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0114931.g009",
