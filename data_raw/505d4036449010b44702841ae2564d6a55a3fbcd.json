            "text": "The pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (CoV) remains poorly understood. In the current study, two recombinant baculovirus were generated to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) isolated from bats (vAcBS) and the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively. Co-infection of insect cells with these two recombinant baculoviruses led to self-assembly of virus-like particles (BVLPs) as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS (BS) into VLPs was confirmed by western blot and immunogold labeling. Such BVLPs up-regulated the level of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Immune responses were compared in immature DCs inoculated with BVLPs or with VLPs formed by S, E and M proteins of human SARS-CoV. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of IL-6 and TNF-a. Further study indicated that IFN-c+ and IL-4+ populations in CD4+ T cells increased upon co-cultivation with DCs pre-exposed with BVLPs or SARS-CoV VLPs. The observed difference in DC-stimulating activity between BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs was very likely due to the S protein. In agreement, SL-CoV S DNA vaccine evoked a more vigorous antibody response and a stronger T cell response than SARS-CoV S DNA in mice. Our data have demonstrated for the first time that SL-CoV VLPs formed by membrane proteins of different origins, one from SL-CoV isolated from bats (BS) and the other two from human SARS-CoV (E and M), activated immature DCs and enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines. Finding in this study may provide important information for vaccine development as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-like CoV.",

Recently, two independent groups reported the identification of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) in different Chinese horseshoe bat species, providing strong evidence that bats could serve as natural reservoirs of SARS CoV [18] [19] [20] . The S coding sequence of SL-CoV isolated from bats displays low level of similarity to those isolated from human (76%) or civets (78%) [18] [19] [20] , while the E and M proteins of SL-CoV have high sequence similarity (96% to 100%) to those from human or civets [19, 20] . It is worthy to note that the nucleotide sequence identity among these coronaviruses from different sources was greatly increased when the S region was excluded [19, 20] . The host range of coronaviruses was reported to correlate with the degree of S protein variations [21] , suggesting that the variations in S protein are responsible for the interspecies transmission and the adaptation to new hosts.",

The stimulating activities of Ebola, Marburg and HIV VLPs in dendritic cells (DCs) were previous investigated [26] [27] [28] , indicating that, unlike native virus, VLPs are effective stimulators of DCs and can enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Our previous study described that VLPs formed by E, M and S proteins of SARS CoV elicited strong SARS CoV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice [29] .

The main variation between SL-CoV and SARS CoV of human or civet locates in the S protein [18] [19] [20] . To study whether BS protein can be incorporated into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of SARS-CoV, we co-infected sf21 cells with the recombinant baculoviruses vAcBS and vAcME. After 72 h of coinfection, the cells were collected and thin-sections were prepared and examined. As shown in Figure 1A , numerous viral particles, ,100 nm in diameter, were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Western blot and immunogold labeling were subsequently performed to detect the incorporation of BS in VLPs. As shown in Figure 1B , the presence of BS, M and E proteins was detected in BVLPs by using an anti-SARS CoV antibody. There were no corresponding bands in the negative control of preimmune rabit antiserum. The genomic differences between SL-CoV and SARS CoV largely locate in the S gene, particularly at the 59 end of S region (equivalent to S1 coding region). Therefore, it is not surprising that serum raised against human SARS CoV recognized bat SL-CoV S protein. The S2 coding region of S protein is highly conserved (,96%) [5, 10, 21] . Using a specific anti-BS2 (Bat S2 region 667-1242 aa) antibody ( Figure 1C ), the gold particles were detected around the BVLPs in immunogold labeling analysis, further confirming the results of western blot. In addition, the anti-BS2 antibody also recognized the human SARS CoV VLPs but not VLPs formed by E and M proteins in the absence of S protein ( Figure 1C ). Taken together, our data indicate that the BS protein of SL-CoV was successfully incorporated into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , similar to those on LPS-treated DCs, all of the four markers were up-regulated to much higher levels than those on PBS or Ac-treated DCs (Fig. 2) .

To assess the effects of BVLPs on DCs, immature DCs were treated under various conditions and supernatants were collected for cytokine (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) quantification. IL-6 and TNF-a are proinflammatory cytokines while IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. As shown in Fig. 3 , incubating DCs with BVLPs significantly enhanced the secretion levels of these three cytokines and were all similar to those in LPS-treated DCs. The boiled-BVLPs lost the ability to induce cytokine production. The secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a were 5-10 folds lower in heated BVLPs-treated DCs than those in BVLPs-treated DCs, although the secretion levels were still 5-15 folds higher than those in PBS or Ac treated groups. This enhancement is likely due to nonspecific stimulation by remaining denatured proteins in heated BVLPs. Moreover, cytokine secretion profiles were similar in DCs inoculated with BVLPs with or without polymyxin B pretreatment, excluding the possibility of LPS contamination. In contrast, LPStreated DCs significantly lost the cytokine-secretion ability with polymyxin B pretreatment. Combining the flow cytometry results in Fig. 2 , it is reasonable to draw a conclusion that the structure of BVLPs, not LPS contamination, contributed to cytokine production in BVLPs-treated DCs.",

Similar to LPS treatment, both SARS CoV VLPs and BVLPs enhanced the expression of CD40, CD86, CD80 and CD83 (Fig. 4) .

In PBS-or Ac-treated groups, the percentage between IFN-c+ and IL-4+ populations in CD4+ T cells did not have significant difference. Thus, the BVLPs or SARS CoV VLPs treated DCs could polarize Th cells toward a Th1 phenotype. The balance between Th1 and Th2 responses to an infectious agent can influence both pathogen growth and immunopathology. Th1-dominant cellular immunity may be a crucial factor for long-term protection against virus infection.",

Antibodies against SARS CoV S protein inhibit pulmonary viral replication and protect against SARS CoV challenge [34] . Variations in the S proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and host tropism of the virus [35, 36] . For instance, SL-CoVs isolated from bats display greater genetic variations than SARS CoVs from humans or civets [19] . Here, we intended to investigate whether the S protein of SL-CoV isolated from bats can incorporate into viral like particles (VLPs) formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV and whether such VLPs can activate DCs. Using baculovirus expression system, we constructed BVLPs incorporated with the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV and the S protein of SL-CoV of bats. Electron microscopy (EM) detection confirmed the formation of VLPs, which were very similar to the morphology of the native virus. Western blot indicated that BS protein was incorporated into BVLPs. Because the major difference of S proteins between SARS CoV and SL-CoV locates in the S1 region (,64%) and the S2 region is more conserved (92% to 96%) [19, 20] , successful incorporation of the SL-CoV S protein into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of SARS CoV suggests that such BVLPs likely assembled through S2 region other than S1 region. These genome-free BVLPs formed by structure proteins from different species provide us a physical means to investigate their immunogenicity in immune cells.",

Exposure of DCs to infectious SARS CoV leads to the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs, including costimulatory molecule expression, T cell-stimulation and cytokine production. [43] . In addition, UV-inactivated SARS CoV also activates immature DCs [44] . In this study, we have demonstrated that BVLPs, morphologically and antigenically similar to the native virus, exhibited stimulating ability in DCs and induced DC maturation by enhancing the expression of cell-surface costimulatory molecules including those essential for optimal activation of T cells: CD40, CD86, CD80 and CD83. Phenotypic maturation of DCs exposed to BVLPs was similar to those observed in DCs incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known stimulator of DCs maturation. In contrast, heat-denatured BVLPs lost the ability to enhance the expression of cell surface molecules and the secretion of cytokine, suggesting that the specific structure of viral proteins might significantly contribute to the immune modulating activity. Taken together, our data indicate that the baculovirus derived-BVLPs can interact with human DCs to induce DC maturation and activation.",

Here, we showed that both BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs activated DCs and induced DC maturation by enhancing the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD86 and CD80) and the maturation marker CD83. A study in SARS CoV-infected patients indicated that the Figure 6 . Evaluation of CD4 T cell types stimulated by BVLPs-exposed DCs. Immature DCs (1610 4 ) were exposed to BVLPs (10 mg/ml), Ac or PBS for 24 h and then co-cultured with CD4+T cells (1610 5 ) levels of IL-6 and TNF-a were markedly increased in the acute stage and returned to normal after given adequate immunosuppressive treatment [45] . Corticosteroid has been used for the treatment of SARS on the basis that proinflammatory cytokines is responsible for the immunopathology in the lungs [46] . Of interest, in the current study, BVLPs induced much higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-a than did SARS CoV VLPs. It seemed that BVLPs vs DCs served as a better model to simulate the acutephase response between the virus and the host. Thus, this model may be applicable in the development of vaccines and drugs against the virus. TNF-a and IL-6 are important proinflammatory cytokines mediating apoptosis, immunity, and inflammation, and may play important role in antiviral responses and inflammation [31] . A previous study by Wang et al indicated that the S protein of SARS CoV played a key role in the production of proinflammatory cytokine at a stage of virus-host cell interaction. S protein could activate NF-kB signaling pathway and thus upregulate the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a. Here we demonstrate that BVLPs are stronger immune modulators in terms of DC activation and maturation. Since the only difference between SARS CoV VLPs and BVLPs was the S protein incorporated, the enhanced immune modulating ability of BVLPs is very likely contributed by the S protein.",

To generate BS2 antiserum, the cDNA of 667-1242 aa in S2 region was cloned into pMAL-c2x expression vector (NEB). BS2 protein was purified by using Amylose Resins (NEB) and then was used to immunize rabbit.",

Thin-section samples were prepared and examined under a Hitachi-H7500 transmission electron microscope. For immunogold labeling, BVLPs were loaded onto a collodion-coated EM grid for 5 min. After removal of the excess sample solution, antibody against BS2 protein was added onto the grid and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Grids were washed three times and then incubated with 15 nm gold conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The samples were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 1 min, then drained, and examined under the EM.",
