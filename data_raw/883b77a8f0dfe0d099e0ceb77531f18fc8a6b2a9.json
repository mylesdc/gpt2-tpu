            "text": "Genetic variation at adaptive gene loci provides direct information on selective processes involving the interaction of individuals with their environment and their capacity for future adaptive changes [1, 2] . Particularly relevant are genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) which evolve under selection pressure imposed by pathogens [2, 3, 4] . MHC genes encode MHC class I (MHC I) and class II (MHC II) proteins that recognize and present pathogen-derived peptides from intracellular (e.g. viruses) and extracellular (e.g. bacteria, helminths) origins, respectively, to cytotoxic and T-helper cells, thereby triggering a cascade of immune responses in vertebrates [5] . Two main selection scenarios are currently debated to explain susceptibility or resistance to parasite infections. One scenario relies on the resistance effects of specific MHC alleles selected frequencydependent in space and time in form of negative frequency dependent selection, also known as rare-allele advantage [6, 7] or in terms of fluctuating selection [8, 9] . The other scenario is based on the assumption that two MHC molecules with different binding properties present different subsets and thus a higher variety of antigens. Heterozygous individuals (heterozygote advantage, overdominance [10] ), or individuals carrying highly dissimilar alleles (divergentallele advantage [10, 11] ) are capable of initiating an appropriate immune response against a more diverse array of pathogens than homozygous individuals or individual with more similar alleles. These non-exclusive hypotheses have been studied by testing associations of specific MHC alleles with pathogens, the proportions of genotypes within populations, patterns of population structure, and the effects of genetic distance between genotypes [2, 12] . The majority of these studies focused on MHC II genotyping and simultaneously scanned for different types of pathogens of extracellular origin in the same individuals [12, 13] . In contrast to these studies, we present a novel approach that also permits a retrospective analysis. We conducted MHC I and II analysis in a carnivore population for which serological data were available from previous studies and formulated predictions on MHC allele/haplotype frequencies, heterozygosity, and genetic distance for the two selection scenarios.",

            "text": "For this study, we focused onthere is the world's largest remaining population of free-ranging African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). This population occurs in Namibia with an estimated population size of 3,100 to 5,800 individuals [14] and is considered a key population for the long-term survival of the species [15] . Free-ranging Namibian cheetahs concentrate in central Namibia, where a large proportion of individuals inhabit unprotected areas that encompass continuous privately owned livestock or game farmland often bordering towns and cities [16] . Consequently, free-ranging cheetahs on Namibian farmland potentially come into close proximity with domestic and feral dogs and cats that are sometimes unvaccinated [17] . Feral dogs and cats can be important vectors of diseases such as canine distemper, which is known to have affected free-ranging cheetahs in the Serengeti, Tanzania [18, 19] . Serosurveys of common feline and canine viruses such as feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline parvovirus (FPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) confirmed the exposure of freeranging and captive Namibian cheetahs to these viral pathogens and a similar virus diversity across the country, but no evidence of clinical signs of infectious diseases in the examined individuals was detected [20, 21] . However, results from these studies showed substantial differences in the exposure to viral pathogens between free-ranging Namibian cheetahs from north-central [20] and eastcentral [21] regions. The proportion of cheetahs tested positive for viruses was higher in north-central than in east-central Namibia [20, 21] . In north-central Namibia 65.3%, 48.0%, 29.2%, 24.3% and 12.2% of the cheetahs were seropositive for FCV, FPV, FCoV, CDV and FHV1, respectively [20] , whereas in east-central Namibia only 4.5% (P,0.0001), 3.0% (P,0.0001), 3.0% (P,0.0001), 4.5% (P = 0.0012) and 3.0% (P = 0.059) of the cheetahs were seropositive for these viruses [21] . This result was attributed to higher human population densities in the northcentral than in the east-central region which would affect contact opportunities of cheetahs with (non-vaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs [21] .",

An essential pre-requisite for testing these predictions is the locus-specific assignment of MHC alleles in the species, which was previously conducted in Namibian cheetahs by combining information on the evolutionary affinities between the observed MHC alleles, qualitative expression analysis, and the distribution of alleles among 149 individuals [24] . A total of ten MHC I alleles and four MHC II-DRB alleles were identified in the population [24] . Here we compared patterns of MHC I and II-DRB exon 2 variation in terms of allelic diversity, heterozygosity and genetic distance among genotypes, and estimated the levels of genetic differentiation using allele and haplotype frequencies between free-ranging Namibian cheetahs from regions that differ in viral pathogen exposure. The heterozygote or divergent allele advantage hypothesis predicts a higher heterozygosity and higher genetic distance at MHC I loci in cheetahs from north-central than east-central Namibia due to an increased exposure to viruses in north-central Namibia. The higher selection pressure in this region might also lead to a higher allelic diversity.",

The substitution is outside the functionally important antigen-binding sites and does not affect the results of this study in any way. We previously determined the locus-specific assignment of MHC alleles in A. jubatus [24] . Using this information, we identified in this study seven and three genotypes for the six and four expressed alleles at the MHC I and II-DRB loci, respectively (Table 1) . Locus A at MHC I and loci A and B at MHC II were monomorphic in all individuals analyzed, and thus they are likely to represent fixed alleles in the population, whereas the loci B and D at MHC I and locus C at MHC II were polymorphic. Allele and haplotype frequencies from polymorphic class I (MHC I-B, MHC I-D) and class II (MHC II DRB-C) loci are presented in Table 2 . Mean H E was 0.3560.21 across both polymorphic MHC I loci and 0.50 for the polymorphic MHC II-DRB locus. This is lower than the mean expected heterozygosity observed at 38 microsatellite loci (mean H E = 0.64-0.71; [12] ). H-W equilibrium was met at locus C of MHC II DRB but it deviated significantly (P = 0.0004) across loci B and D of MHC I, resulting in a deficit of heterozygotes (Table 2 ). This is due to the locus B (P = 0.005) because locus D remained at H-W equilibrium (P = 0.30) (data not in Table 2 ).",

Owing to a higher selective pressure imposed by viruses in northcentral than east-central Namibia, we expected to detect a higher allelic diversity, heterozygosity and genetic distance at MHC I loci. However, cheetahs from both regions showed similar levels of genetic variation in terms of allelic diversity, heterozygosity and amino acid distance at MHC I loci.

Diverse and even pleiotropic interactions of pathogens and potential specialist and generalist MHC alleles in terms of different pathogen detection might coexist on the individual level and thus obscure the conformity on the population level. We detected, however, clear differences in the haplotype frequencies across MHC I loci, resulting in a significant differentiation between cheetahs from north-central and eastcentral regions. This implies that specific MHC I alleles/ haplotypes were selected in a frequency-dependent manner in space and time according to their functional importance by either negative frequency dependent selection, rare-allele advantage [6, 7] or fluctuating selection [8, 9] . Fluctuating selection, i.e. spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the abundance of pathogens, could well cause significant differences in allele and haplotype frequencies across populations even if the overall allelic diversity remains constant. While individuals from these regions were highly differentiated at the MHC I loci, no difference was observed at MHC II-DRB locus.",

However, it is unlikely that this affected the results in a significant way. As argued by Thalwitzer et al. [21] , the use of different protocols is only likely to lead to different results if the investigated virus is highly variable in antigenicity [29, 30] , as is likely the case with for example FCV and FCoV [31, 32] , but not if it is antigenetically conserved, as is likely with FHV, FPV and CDV [33, 34, 35] . Thalwitzer et al. [21] further argued that serum neutralisation tests are more specific and thus more conservative than immunofluorescence assay tests. This is because the former tests detect antibodies only when they bind to relatively small areas on the viral surface, whereas the latter tests detect antibodies directed to a broader array of epitopes on the viral surface [36] . Because of the antigene conservatism in some of the viruses and because the antibodies to several viruses in north-central Namibian cheetahs were tested with serum neutralisation tests [20, 21] , the difference between the higher seroprevalence in north-central and the lower seroprevalence in eastcentral Namibian cheetahs for FHV, FPV, CDV, and FCV is likely to be an underestimate and thus reflect genuine differences in seroprevalence.",

Because MHC I fights against intracellular-derived pathogens such as viruses and MHC II-DRB against extracellular-derived pathogens such as bacteria and helminths, the contrasting distribution of genetic variation between MHC I and MHC II-DRB loci suggests that intracellular-derived pathogens exert a stronger selection pressure than extracellular-derived pathogens in cheetahs across Namibian farmland. Alternatively, the lack of MHC II-DRB differentiation in Namibian cheetah may also be explained by extra-cellular pathogens exerting strong selective pressure that is spatially uniform across Namibia. In order to further understand and draw conclusions on the pathogen-mediated mechanisms that act on MHC II-DRB variation of the Namibian cheetah population, data on extracellular-derived pathogens such as their diversity, abundance and distribution is essential.",

Therefore, the effects of variation in population size and other historical processes become visible on the genetic level by comparing different types of molecular markers [4] . To control for the confounding effects of demographic processes on patterns of MHC variation in the Namibian cheetah population, we compared the extent of genetic differentiation at both MHC classes with the level estimated for neutral microsatellites by Marker et al. [22] . The latter study revealed 248 alleles in 38 microsatellite loci from 89 free-ranging Namibian cheetahs originating from the same regions as in the present study. A lack of genetic differentiation at the microsatellites (mean F ST = 0.02, P.0.05) among regions indicates that free-ranging Namibian cheetahs represent a large panmictic population [22] . Hence, the patterns of genetic differentiation at adaptive MHC I and neutral microsatellites differed markedly in the Namibian cheetah population. The high genetic differentiation observed in MHC I but not in microsatellites between Namibian cheetahs from northcentral and east-central regions is therefore a likely consequence of selection pressure driven by viral pathogens rather than demographic processes affecting gene flow. Therefore, genetic differentiation at MHC I loci of the contemporary Namibian cheetah population appears to be maintained by an ongoing selective process. It is difficult, however, to draw conclusions based solely on empirical comparisons between MHC genes and microsatellites because the mutational processes and selective regimes of these genetic markers are different [37] . Still, we showed with this study that information on seroprevalences from previous studies can be used to test predictions derived from different selection scenarios and to make conclusions on the pathogen-mediated mechanisms acting on a free-ranging population.",

Conservation plans based solely on neutral genetic variation are not guaranteed to preserve adaptive genetic variation because both sources of genetic variation are not always positively correlated. Gene flow within a population might result in low differentiation in neutral markers, but there might still be high differentiation in adaptive markers in the population [37] . The Namibian cheetah population represents a large panmictic population as revealed by neutral microsatellite markers [22] . Yet, our results show a high differentiation in adaptive MHC I loci between cheetahs from east-central and north-central regions. This finding is of great relevance for the conservation of the Namibian cheetah population. Translocation of cheetahs within Namibia is an increasingly common management tool for conservation purposes. In light of our results, such translocations should be carefully planned as a wrongly chosen origin of or destination area for translocated animals may adversely affect their ability to cope with different pathogenic selection pressures. Therefore, further research should focus on MHC composition in relation to pathogen load in cheetahs from different African populations.",

The sequences were aligned and coding regions were translated into deduced amino acid sequences using Clustal W as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [40] . The MHC-like nature of the sequences was verified through a homology analysis using blastn (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Standard diversity indices were estimated using the software Arlequin 3.1 [41] . Allele frequencies were estimated at all putative loci separately and as a whole haplotype for MHC I loci. For haplotypes, the frequencies of co-occurring alleles (which presumably constitute a haplotype on a given chromosome) were estimated as the number of individual occurrences of a certain allele divided by its total count observed in the population. Expected heterozygosity (H E ) was estimated as a general indicator of the amount of genetic variation in the population [42] . Departures from Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium were assessed by applying exact tests [43] . The genetic distance between individual alleles were calculated by the number of amino acid substitutions using the Poisson model as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [40] .",

[21] (Fig. 2) . These two regions lack physical barriers but differ substantially in viral pathogen exposure as revealed by seroprevalence studies conducted in Namibian cheetahs [20, 21] . The ratio of males and females was similar in the north-central (N males = 18, N females = 8) and the east-central region (N males = 49, N females = 13, x 2 = 0.97, df = 1, p = 0.33). The prediction of different allele and haplotype frequencies between regions was tested by using Fstatistics [44] and exact tests of sample differentiation [45] as implemented in Arlequin 3.1. Additionally, we used the chi-square (x 2 ) and Fisher's method of combined P values obtained by Fisher's exact test as implemented in CHIFISH [46] for MHC I loci. This was done because we combined information from multiple loci which may result in low statistical power and prevent detection of true genetic divergence [47] . This problem occurs particularly in small contingency tables (few populations and few alleles per locus) as observed in our data set. We also tested for differences in the allele and haplotype frequencies between male and female cheetahs to control for any effect due to the malebiased sampling. Differences in heterozygosity between northcentral and east-central Namibian cheetahs as well as between males and females were tested with chi-square test in SPSS Version 16.0.",
