The demographic characteristics of the study population have been published elsewhere (Watkins et al., in preparation). Table 1 shows the breakdown of general physician visit by READ code. Table 2 shows the percentage of patients in each risk group vaccinated by year. Elderly patients (age 65+ years) had the highest uptake rates, and uptake rates generally increased between the beginning and end of the study period in each risk group. In the high-risk group, the mean age of the vaccinated group was 65.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 16.5) compared with 48.2 years (SD 20.4) in the unvaccinated group (p<0.001). The mean number of risk conditions in the vaccinated group was 1.29 (SD 0.60), compared with 1.15 (SD 0.45) in the unvaccinated group (p<0.001). In the patients without risk conditions, vaccinated patients were also older than unvaccinated patients (mean 64.6 years [SD 17.3] compared with mean 36.6 years [SD 16.8], p = 0.003). Vaccinated patients were therefore statistically significantly different from unvaccinated patients, as they were older and had more risk conditions. This should be taken into account when considering outcomes in the different groups. Table 4 shows the number and cost of ILI-related hospital admissions, GP consultations and outpatient visits in low-risk patients by vaccination and complication status. Data on the absolute numbers of ILI-related admissions, GP consultations and outpatient visits can be found in S1 Table, and data on hospital admissions stratified by the route of admission (via accident and emergency, GP referral or other routes) can be found in S2 Table. In low-risk patients, unvaccinated patients used more GP and outpatient resources than vaccinated patients, reflecting the large number of unvaccinated low-risk cases in the database. Secondary care resource use was more evenly split, with slightly higher total resource use and cost in the group of vaccinated patients than in the group of unvaccinated patients. This is consistent with the older age of vaccinated patients compared with the unvaccinated group. Extrapolated to the UK, the cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions over the study period in lowrisk vaccinated patients was \u00a327,391,142 and \u00a3141,932,471, respectively.

In high-risk patients, the group of vaccinated patients used more resources in primary and secondary care, compared with the group of unvaccinated patients. This is consistent with the older age and higher number of risk conditions in vaccinated than unvaccinated patients. As was the case in low-risk patients, secondary care resource use was concentrated in cases of influenza with complications recorded, regardless of vaccination status.

Overall, more deaths were observed in vaccinated than unvaccinated patients. This is consistent with the systematic difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, as vaccinated individuals were older and more fragile with more risk conditions than unvaccinated individuals. However, among the group aged 65 years or more, the mortality rate among vaccinated individuals was 25% (odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.88; p<0.001) lower than in unvaccinated individuals (3.3% of the age category and 4.3% of the age category, respectively) ( Table 6) .

To our knowledge, this is the first time that linked primary care and hospital databases have been used to estimate the burden of ILI. Furthermore, this is the first study to report quantitative data for ILI burden by complication status (with complications recorded or without complications recorded), age, risk and vaccination status. Influenza vaccination uptake increased over the study period, but vaccination still failed to reach 20-25% of people aged 65 years and older. In England, the target rate for influenza vaccination in 2011-2012 was 75% in people aged 65+ years and 60% in other at-risk groups, increasing to 75% in 2013/2014 [20] . Our study indicates that the vaccination uptake rates achieved in the elderly population were close to the target range. However, vaccination uptake rates in other at-risk groups were generally exceedingly low compared with the 2013/2014 target of 75%, except in a few conditions such as diabetes and renal disease. Improving vaccination uptake rates in younger age groups with risk conditions, and further improving vaccination uptake in the elderly, may have the potential to reduce the considerable burden of ILI in the UK. Our analysis demonstrates that vaccinated high-risk individuals have better outcomes than high-risk unvaccinated individuals.",

Scaled up to the whole UK population, this would be equivalent to over \u00a3168 million for GP visits and over \u00a3112 million for hospital admissions. This raises the possibility that mass annual vaccination could potentially have medical and economic benefits, by reducing the burden of influenza cases in individuals who are not in groups currently targeted for vaccination. Universal influenza vaccination was introduced in Ontario, Canada, in 2000 and has been associated with reductions in influenza-related mortality and healthcare use, compared with targeted vaccination programmes in other provinces [21] .

            "text": "Vaccinated patients differed significantly from unvaccinated patients, being older and with more risk conditions. This pattern is well known [23] , and is to be expected from current government policy, which targets elderly and/or high-risk groups for influenza vaccination. It is consistent with the observed pattern of higher resource use in vaccinated patients in the highrisk group in the present study; since vaccinated individuals were older and had more risk conditions than unvaccinated individuals, they are likely to have more fragile health and thus to need more healthcare. As vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are significantly different, outcomes cannot be directly compared and the data should be interpreted with caution. The only population in which vaccinated and unvaccinated groups could be compared is the sub-group aged 65 years and older, as according to current policy all individuals in this age group should receive seasonal influenza vaccination. Among this group, the ILI-related mortality rate among vaccinated individuals was 25% lower than the mortality rate among unvaccinated individuals. This is consistent with a protective effect of influenza vaccination. The effect size was similar to that reported by previous studies in this population group, which have reported reductions of 33-62% in hospitalisations, 27-39% in hospitalisations for acute and chronic respiratory illness and 39-54 in all-cause mortality [24] [25] [26] . Multivariate analysis indicated that patients categorised as high-risk had a disproportionate risk of hospitalisation. However, high-risk individuals who had also been vaccinated had a lower risk of hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk alone. Similarly, patients who were high-risk had a higher probability of >1 GP visit, whereas patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a lower probability of >1 GP visit. These findings suggest that vaccination may help to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and additional GP visits in high-risk groups. This demonstrates the clear benefit of vaccination of high-risk individuals and the rationale for ensuring that coverage in this group of individuals be reinforced, as coverage in those younger than 65 years is below target. Low vaccination coverage places individuals at risk of serious complications and death because they are not being vaccinated against influenza. However, although our results show clearly that vaccinated high-risk patients in the database had lower rates of additional GP visits and hospitalisations than unvaccinated high-risk patients in the database, there may be potential for confounding by differences in health-seeking behaviour that could not be captured in the database or accounted for in the analysis. For example, surveys in adults with asthma [27] and parents of high-risk children [28] at single UK GP practices have identified lack of awareness, barriers to access and health beliefs as factors influencing influenza vaccine uptake. Such factors could have the potential to confound our results if they also affect patients' readiness to seek treatment (for example, patients who wait until severe symptoms develop before presenting for medical attention may require higher levels of intervention than patients who present early). Our analysis would not be able to identify such potential confounding factors, and this is a limitation of the study. A recent case-control study using GPRD data in people at low risk for influenza in the UK found that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of influenza (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60, 0.91) when given within 4 months before seasonal influenza outbreaks [29] . However, despite the authors' attempt to minimise confounding, they identified a residual confounding effect in that a group of people in the study with annual vaccinations in multiple years were also consistently more likely to develop influenza than those who received fewer annual vaccinations [29] . This may indicate that this group had predisposing medical conditions that made them simultaneously more likely to seek influenza vaccination and also at higher risk of influenza.",

The correlation coefficients show that for influenza B, deaths were more closely correlated with hospitalisations than hospitalisations with GP visits. For influenza A and other respiratory infections, hospitalisations were more closely correlated with GP visits than deaths with hospitalisation. The multivariate analysis also showed a statistically significant increase in the odds of hospitalisation in years with vaccine influenza B mismatch. In seasons with a mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the circulating influenza lineages, individuals may receive less clinical benefit from vaccination than anticipated, because the vaccine provides limited or no protection against the mismatched virus lineage. This suggests that improving vaccine protection against influenza B in mismatched years could be of value. Quadrivalent influenza vaccination provides protection against both influenza B lineages, which have started to co-circulate in recent years, and should therefore improve protection.",

If any patients had complications that were not recorded, they could potentially have been mis-coded as having influenza without complications. To explore this possibility we investigated the full records of the small number of patients who were admitted to hospital despite having no complications of influenza recorded in the database. This showed that although the patients had no secondary diagnosis codes (and were therefore classed as having no complications), they in fact had complications such as pneumonia or other respiratory manifestations. Coding errors such as these form a natural limitation to any retrospective database study, as even a comprehensive database cannot capture all possible information.",

The data were divided into influenza seasons running from 1 April to 31 March inclusive, e.g. 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002, etc. The study thus covered nine influenza seasons. The first season (2000-2001) ran from the study start date on 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2001. Influenza circulated from week 4 in 2001 according to surveillance data from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), so the study would have captured the majority of the influenza cases in the 2000-2001 season, although it is possible that there were some cases in the last weeks of 2000 for which data were not collected.",
