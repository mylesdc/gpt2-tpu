The pathological changes were severe, and general hyperemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis were evident in the tissues of dead swine. PCR was used to identify the pathogen and we tested for eight viruses (HEV, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PCV2, Classical swine fever virus, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, Porcine parvovirus and Pseudorabies virus) that are prevalent in Chinese pig farms. The livers, kidneys, spleens, and other organs of the necropsied swine were positive for HEV and/or PCV2. Immunohistochemical staining showed HEV-and PCV2-antigen-positive signals in the livers, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and intestine. Conclusion: HEV and PCV2 co-infection in piglets was detected in four out of seven dead pigs from two pig farms in Hebei, China, producing severe pathological changes. The natural co-infection of HEV and PCV2 in pigs in China has rarely been reported. We speculate that co-infection with PCV2 and HEV may bring some negative effect on pig production and recommend that more attention should be paid to this phenomenon.",

            "text": "The rapid development of the pig industry in China accompanies with outbreaks of epidemic diseases in recent years. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified on pig farms in many regions of the world, including China [1] [2] [3] . HEV seropositivity rates of 76.6% and 90% have been reported in pig herds of large-scale and family-scale farms in China, respectively [4] . Increasing evidence indicates that HEV can infect both humans and animal [5] . To date, most studies of HEV based on prevalence surveys, and research into HEV-associated mortality during natural infection was limited. Mao et al. reported that co-infection with HEV and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) could lead to high mortality in swine [6] , and they speculated that co-infection with HEV and other pathogens could cause serious disease. It has been demonstrated that HEV and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) could cause infectious hepatitis, but swine naturally co-infected with HEV and PCV2 in China has rarely been reported [3, 7, 8] . PCV2 infection occurs in many countries and poses a considerable threat to the swine industry [9] . Although the recently research showed that infection of PCV2 could be effectively reduced by utilizing PCV2 vaccine [10] , prevention of PCV2 in the pig production should be paid more attention. In the present study, pathogen identification and the observation of pathological changes demonstrated a natural co-infection with HEV and PCV2 in the swine on two pig farms in Hebei Province, China. This discovery may provide a new perspective for clinical research.",

The lesions observed in the lung, liver, heart, kidney, lymph node, spleen and intestinal tract tissues were similar in all the pigs necropsied. The heart lesions were characterized as viral myocarditis (Figure 2A ). The epicardium was predominantly infiltrated by lymphocytes, with a small number of neutrophils ( Figure 2B ). Granular myocardial degeneration, edema, and lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the myocardium were observed ( Figure 2C) . A hepatic examination revealed features characteristic of hepatitis in a number of liver samples, including congestion, vacuolization, and necrosis, ( Figure 2E ). Lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration, particularly in the portal area, was clearly observed ( Figure 2F ). Examination of the lungs demonstrated large areas of hyperemia, hemorrhage, and lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration, with very little normal histological structure. The bronchioles contained exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells and pink liquid exudate ( Figure 2G ,H). Enlargement of the glomerulus and focal lymphocyte infiltration were observed in the kidneys. The renal tubule epithelial cells showed granular degeneration and necrosis, and congestion and hemorrhage were present in the kidneys. The renal tubule epithelial cells shed off from the basilar membrane. The glomerulus contained albuminoid droplets of exudate ( Figure 2I ,J). The organs of immune system were severely underdeveloped, and malformed splenic white pulp was responsible for the reduced numbers of lymphocytes ( Figure 2D ). Poorly developed lymph nodes were also evident. The majority of capillaries were expanded and hyperemia was present. The lymphoid nodules were smaller than normal, resulting from fibrosis, necrosis, and lymphocyte depletion ( Figure 2K , L). Examination of the intestine revealed necrosis, and coagulation of the intestinal villi. The submucosal layer was exposed due to the loss of mucosal layer. Epithelial cell shedding and secretion from the intestinal glands into the gut cavity were increased ( Figure 2M , N). The main pathological changes observed in the various organs of the seven necropsied pigs are summarized in Table 1 . ",

Swine are considered to be a major reservoir of the HEV transmitted to humans [3, 11] . Four main genotypes have been identified in HEV. Genotypes 1 and 2 have only been found in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have been recovered from both humans and pigs [12] . Smith et al. recently proposed a taxonomic scheme, which divided the family Hepeviridae into the genera Orthohepevirus (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and Piscihepevirus (cutthroat trout virus) [13] . The livers of pigs naturally infected or intravenously inoculated with HEV display focal lymphocytic infiltration and swollen, vacuolated hepatocytes [14] . The livers of the seven pigs investigated in the present study had significant lymphocytic infiltration in the portal area, and large localized areas of fibrosis, necrosis, and vacuolization. IHC staining showed that the ORF2 protein of HEV was distributed across multiple organs, particularly in the liver and kidneys. This result was not unexpected because the liver is the target organ of HEV, and the kidney plays an integral role in maintaining extracellular fluid homeostasis. The previous study also demonstrates that HEV has been found in liver and kidney after experimental infection in domestic pigs [15] . A PCR assay specific for HEV ORF2 confirmed that the pigs were HEV positive. Isolates CHN-HB-HD-L1, CHN-HB-HD-L2, HB-L3, CHN-HB-HD-L4, and CHN-HB-HD-L5 were shown to belong to genotype 4, the most prevalent HEV genotype in China. According to Smith et al.

Hemorrhage, hyperemia, edema, necrosis, and lymphocyte infiltration were observed in all organs, most notably the lungs. Histological changes consistent with lobar pneumonia were also evident in the lungs, and normal lung histology was rarely seen. The alveolar walls were thickened, with substantial lymphocyte, erythrocyte, and exudate infiltration. Exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells and pink liquid exudate were observed within the bronchioles. PCV2 has a small, nonenveloped icosahedral virion, and a single-stranded circular DNA genome, 1,767-1,768 nt in length. The genome has two major ORFs encoded in the antisense direction [18] . Isolates HBHD-L1, HBHD-L3, HBHD-L4, HBHD-L5, HBHD-L6, and HBHD-L7 recovered in this study were closely related to the genotype PCV2d strains HNF911 (KJ680361), SD-ZB2 (KJ511876), WSEC11 (KJ680353), GXYQ12 (KJ680367), TDBS12 (KJ680354) (Figure 4) . The genotype PCV2d represented a novel genotype and a shift from PCV2a to PCV2b as the predominant genotype in China in recent years [19] . A genetic analysis, combined with the observed pathological changes, indicated that the PCV2 isolates detected in this study were probably high prevalent in China [20] . IHC staining of tissues for the ORF2 protein of PCV2 revealed that the antigen was observed in the lungs, liver, lymph node, intestine and kidneys, further evidence of PCV2 infection.",

This observation is consistent with the viral invasion pathways. The transmission of HEV occurs via the fecal-oral route, so HEV may invade the animal through the intestinal mucous layer, with infection progressing to the lamina propria. We have investigated the mucosal immunity in the intestines of rabbits [21] and gerbils (data not shown) experimentally infected with HEV, and both studies demonstrated a strong HEV ORF2 positive signals in intestinal. In the present study, naturally infected swine exhibited significant necrosis of the intestinal epithelial cells and also showed HEV ORF2 positive signals in intestine. Therefore, HEV invasion of the intestine may proceed rapidly and widely, consistent with the diffuse labeling pattern observed in the intestine in this study.",

Nevertheless, no typical microscopic lesions such as granulomatous inflammation or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in lymphoid tissue, liver, spleen, and other tissues [22] . The mortality associated with PCV2 infection is generally around 10% (range 4%-20%), but can reach 50% [23] . In our case, seven pigs were detected and the pathogens had been identified. However, the true reason for the high mortality in the whole pig farm A and B still need more exploring. The occurrence of this disease may not be only a matter of PMWS caused by PCV2 infection. The previous study showed swine HEV infection can be a significant factor to the development of hepatitis regardless of the PMWS status [8] . In addition, J. Ellis [24] claimed that the severity of hepatic lesions in PCV-2 infected pigs may be enhanced by co-infection with swine hepatitis E virus. It may indicate that the significance of HEV is hardly negligent. Further investigation about the mechanistic basis for the pathogenesis of the clinical syndrome that associated with PCV2 and HEV coinfection needs to be conducted.",

In order to reveal the mechanism for the similar pathological changes in the HEV and/or PCV2 infected pigs, further tests about HEV and PCV2 co-infection, single HEV infection and single PCV2 infection in pigs have been in the planning. We hope to reveal the mechanism of the similar pathological changes and also discover the similarity and differences between the natural cases and the experimental infected pigs. To our best knowledge, theses following reasons are speculated to explain the similar pathological changes: a) the individual differences in pigs. Different pigs may have different reaction to the attack of the viruses; b) pig No.2 may once have been infected with PCV2 and then PCV2 were neutralized by the antibody. But lesions in the tissues hadn't recovered when it died; c) HEV is RNA virus without envelope.

The sequences were analyzed with DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Corp., Quebec, Canada). Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the MEGA software (version 4.0; http://www.megasoftware.net) using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates.Immunohistochemistry was used to detect HEV and PCV2 antigens in the liver, kidney, lymph nodes, intestine and lung. The endogenous enzymatic activity in the tissues was blocked with 5% H 2 O 2 . Goat serum was used to block the Fc receptors in the tissues. The primary antibody, monoclonal mouse anti-HEV ORF2 antibody (1:300 dilution; Beijing Protein Institute, Beijing, China), was added to the sections and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. IHC staining was performed with the Histostain\u2122-Plus Kit (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The substrate 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (ZSGB-BIO) was applied for 10 min, after which Gill's hematoxylin counterstain was added. A monoclonal mouse anti-PCV2 ORF2 antibody (1:200 dilution; kindly supplied by Dr. Liu Jue, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Livestock and Poultry, Beijing, China) was used to detect PCV2. For the negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. In another negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with IgG from a normal mouse to demonstrate the specificity of the signal.HEV: Hepatitis E virus; HE: Hepatitis E; PCV2: Porcine circovirus 2; PRRSV: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; CSFV: Classical swine fever virus; PEDV: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; TGEV: Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus; PRV: Pseudorabies virus; PPV: Porcine parvovirus; PMWS: Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. your next manuscript to BioMed Central and take full advantage of: \u2022 Convenient online submission \u2022 Thorough peer review \u2022 No space constraints or color figure charges \u2022 Immediate publication on acceptance \u2022 Inclusion in PubMed, CAS, Scopus and Google Scholar \u2022 Research which is freely available for redistributionSubmit your manuscript at www.biomedcentral.com/submit",
