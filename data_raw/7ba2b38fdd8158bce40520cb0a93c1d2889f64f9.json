            "text": "Subtype specificity of influenza A virus (IAV) is determined by its two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For HA, 16 distinct subtypes (H1-H16) exist, while nine exist for NA. The epidemic strains of H1N1 IAV change frequently and cause annual seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics, such as the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic. The recent introduction of pandemic A/H1N1 IAV (H1N1pdm virus) into humans re-emphasizes the public health concern about H1N1 IAV. Several studies have identified conserved epitopes within specific HA subtypes that can be used for diagnostics. However, immune specific epitopes in H1N1 IAV have not been completely assessed. In this study, linear epitopes on the H1N1pdm viral HA protein were identified by peptide scanning using libraries of overlapping peptides against convalescent sera from H1N1pdm patients. One epitope, P5 (aa 58-72) was found to be immunodominant in patients and to evoke high titer antibodies in mice. Multiple sequence alignments and in silico coverage analysis showed that this epitope is highly conserved in influenza H1 HA [with a coverage of 91.6% (9,860/10,767)] and almost completely absent in other subtypes [with a coverage of 3.3% (792/23,895)]. This previously unidentified linear epitope is located outside the five well-recognized antigenic sites in HA. A peptide ELISA method based on this epitope was developed and showed high correlation (x 2 = 51.81, P,0.01, Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.741) with a hemagglutination inhibition test. The highly conserved H1 subtype-specific immunodominant epitope may form the basis for developing novel assays for sero-diagnosis and active surveillance against H1N1 IAVs.",

IAVs cause seasonal influenza epidemics annually and recurring pandemics with severe consequences for public health and global economy [1, 2] . At least three IAV-pandemics emerged in the last century (1918 A/H1N1, 1957 A/H2N2, and 1968 A/H3N2). The 1918 Spanish flu was the most serious influenza pandemic that killed over 50 million people worldwide [3] . The latter two pandemics, although mild compared to the 1918 incidence, resulted in significant mortality, with close to 2 million and 1 million deaths, respectively [4] . The latest pandemic influenza, and newest global health challenge, occurred in 2009 due to the emergence of an A/ H1N1 pandemic IAV (H1N1pdm virus). The H1N1pdm virus has been detected in more than 214 countries and territories and has caused 18,389 deaths as of July 30, 2010 [5] .",

HA also stimulates host protective immunities, specifically the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Several IAV subtype-specific serological tests have been developed. At present, subtyping of IAV mainly relies on a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using HA and NA subtype-specific reference sera [15] . However, there are a number of drawbacks to HI testing. This assay is 1) relatively laborious; 2) low in sensitivity; 3) requires preparation of antigen from viable viruses which are potentially hazardous and 4) contains low signal to noise ratio, e.g. the assay exhibits inter-variability and subtype cross-reactivity [16, 17] . Moreover, the HI test can be confounded by steric hindrance from NA antibodies, leading to nonspecific inhibition and misidentification [18] .",

A set of 50 peptides with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides spanning the ectodomain sequences of the HA protein of the H1N1pdm virus strain A/California/04/2009 were synthesized. The binding between these peptides and the convalescent serum samples from 11 H1N1pdm patients were examined by ELISA using these peptides as coating antigens. Five of these peptides (P3, P5, P15, P16 and P31) were found to react well with the sera tested. These peptides corresponded to the sequences of amino acid (aa) residues 38-52, 58-72, 158-172, 168-182, and 318-332 in the HA molecule, respectively ( Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). Among them, the P3 peptide reacted with 54.5% (6/11) of the sera, the P15 and P16 peptides reacted with 81.8% (9/11) of the sera, while the P5 and P31 peptides reacted with 100% (11/11) of the sera. These data indicated that these peptides may contain H1N1pdm virus B cell epitopes.",

As shown in Fig. 5 , antibody induced by the P5-KLH conjugate was inhibited by peptide N10-N14 and the parental peptide P5 to similar extents, whereas peptides N6-N9 only showed inefficient inhibition even at high molar concentrations. A similar pattern of inhibition was observed with the C-terminal conservative derivatives. Peptides C12, C13, C14, and the parent peptide P5 demonstrated comparable and efficient inhibition, whereas only slight inhibition was observed in peptides C6-C11 (Fig. 5B) . Since the amino acid sequence LRGVAPL overlapped both peptides N10 and C12 (Fig. 5) , we speculate that this sequence met the minimum requirements of binding to the anti-P5 antibody.

            "text": "IAV escapes the human immune system by continuous antigenic drifts and occasional antigenic shifts [33] . Attempts to develop universal vaccines and reliable diagnostic tools based on conserved epitopes of IAV are big challenges. Several epitopes that can elicit broad spectrum neutralizing antibodies have been identified recently. For example, Sui et al. identified a universal neutralizing epitope for group 1 HA [34] . Yoshida et al. reported a universal epitope in antigenic site B shared by H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13 subtypes [35] . All these epitopes are conformationdependent. In this study, we identified two epitopes (P5 and P31) which have not been identified previously (Fig. S1 ). The P5 (aa58-72) seems to be a dispatch that links the stem region and the globular region and is fully exposed on the surface, while P31 (aa 318-332d) is located in the middle of helix A and B on HA2. In contrast to previous studies, we found P5 to be a linear B cell epitope. Our data demonstrate that this epitope is highly conserved among H1 viruses (9860/10767, 91.6%). Because viral mutants that are resistant to conformational epitopes are more easily generated, the conserved linear epitope is more suitable for differentiating subtypes than conformational epitopes [33] . Hence, the epitope in P5 provides a new target for reliable diagnostics of H1-subtype IAVs.",

In previous studies, monoclonal antibodies from murine hybridoma cells were used to identify antigenic sites, while in this study we used a peptide scanning approach, which involves overlapping peptide library and human convalescent antisera-a strategy that is widely used for viral epitope identification [27, 42] . Given the fact that viral antigen can be recycled and presented as short peptides with different conformation during humoral immune response and these short peptides can be selected by B cell clones [43] , and that convalescent sera from patients were much more complex than monoclonal antibodies from mice and can reflect the real immune responses during viral infection [44] , our approach adds to the available techniques currently being used to identify linear epitopes in serologic tests. Because HA pseudotyped lentivirus has been widely applied in the study on neutralizing antibodies against IAVs [30] , we used this method to evaluate if the epitopes identified in this study could stimulate neutralizing antibodies. Our data showed that these epitopes could not elicit neutralizing antibodies in pseudovirion neutralizing assays due to their linear nature. Previous studies have shown that most neutralizing epitopes are conformation dependent [34, 35] .",

To map the epitope contained in P5, we performed a peptide-inhibition ELISA using a series of N-terminal and Cterminal truncated peptides. However, we found that the fulllength P5 (15 aa in length) rather than truncated peptides showed strongest binding to the corresponding antibody ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 ). As peptides N10 and C12 are the shortest truncated P5 that can bind to anti-P5 antibody and share a core sequence of LRGVAPL, we tested whether this sequence could be the epitope. However, the synthetic peptide LRGVAPL did not block P5-antibody interactions nor bind P5 antibody (Fig. 6) . Thus, we speculate that adjacent amino acids to this sequence are also involved in the binding of antibody elicited by P5-KLH conjugates. The concept of using linear epitopes in influenza virus diagnostics and control has not been extensively investigated. In a recent study, an epitope-blocking ELISA, which can universally detect antibodies to human H5N1 virus, has been developed [17] . Our results show that a peptide-ELISA based on the highly conserved H1 subtype-specific epitope can also be used for the detection of H1 antibodies, displaying good correlativity with the HI test. Our results indicate the potential of the P5 epitope in H1subtype IAV diagnosis. However, the performance of this assay needs to be further evaluated in studies with large scale samples.",

Briefly, each peptide (1 mg/well) or protein (0.1 mg/well) was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4uC overnight. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumen (BSA), the plates were incubated with indicated diluted serum samples (human or mouse) at 37uC for 2 hr, then washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Bound IgG antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 37uC for 1 hr. After four washes with PBS-T, the reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, sigma). Color development was stopped by the addition of 50 ml/well of 2 M sulphuric acid after 15 min. The optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 nm ) was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California). To evaluate the reactivity of the P5-derived short peptides with the anti-P5 antibody, peptide-inhibition ELISA assays were performed by adding dilutions of the peptides to a constant amount of the antibody elicited by the P5-KLH conjugates (1:5000 dilution). Maximum binding to antigen-coated wells was observed in the absence of a peptide inhibitor. The antibody bound was expressed as a percentage of the maximum level of binding.",

The former program was used to define the number of total sequences in HA proteins according to the Subtype parameter (H1 or H2-H16). The latter program defined the number of hits (P5 or P31) in the H1 or H2-H16 total sequences. Because there are no standards for evaluating short peptide sequence homology, we chose the fuzzy match analysis to represent the identical level of a peptide sequence to HA proteins. The analysis type was chosen as fuzzy match, which meant .50% of characters were identical to the searched aa string. For example, entering GILGFVFTL may also find AILGFVFTI but not ALIGFVFSI.",
