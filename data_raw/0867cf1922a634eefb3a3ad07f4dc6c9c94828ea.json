            "text": "Most of current strategies for antiviral therapeutics target the virus specifically and directly, but an alternative approach to drug discovery might be to enhance the immune response to a broad range of viruses. Based on clinical observation in humans and successful genetic strategies in experimental models, we reasoned that an improved interferon (IFN) signaling system might better protect against viral infection. Here we aimed to identify small molecular weight compounds that might mimic this beneficial effect and improve antiviral defense. Accordingly, we developed a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify small molecules that enhance the IFN signaling pathway components. The assay is based on a phenotypic screen for increased IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity in a fully automated and robust format (Z9.0.7). Application of this assay system to a library of 2240 compounds (including 2160 already approved or approvable drugs) led to the identification of 64 compounds with significant ISRE activity. From these, we chose the anthracycline antibiotic, idarubicin, for further validation and mechanism based on activity in the sub-mM range. We found that idarubicin action to increase ISRE activity was manifest by other members of this drug class and was independent of cytotoxic or topoisomerase inhibitory effects as well as endogenous IFN signaling or production. We also observed that this compound conferred a consequent increase in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and a significant antiviral effect using a similar dose-range in a cell-culture system inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The antiviral effect was also found at compound concentrations below the ones observed for cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results provide proof of concept for using activators of components of the IFN signaling pathway to improve IFN efficacy and antiviral immune defense as well as a validated HTS approach to identify small molecules that might achieve this therapeutic benefit.",

            "text": "There has been significant progress in the development of vaccines and therapeutics against viruses, but there are still major gaps in medical therapy for some of the most common types of viral infections. For these types of infections, vaccines can still be ineffective due to new and emergent strains and can exhibit significant off-target effects [1, 2] . Similarly, the efficacy of antiviral therapeutics can often be limited by pathogen resistance as another sign of the difficulty in keeping up with rapidly evolving viral genomes [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . An alternative to agents that specifically and directly target the virus itself is the possibility of improving natural host defense against a broad range of viruses. Although antiviral defense exhibits significant complexity and redundancy, one system that stands out as a useful target for improvement is the one based on the action of interferons (IFNs). And within this IFN system, which is similarly complex, the STAT1 transcription factor is remarkable as a central component that is critical for the functional activity of each type of IFN ( Figure 1 ). Consequently, genetic loss of STAT1 function causes a marked susceptibility to viral infection in mice and humans [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, modification of STAT1 to a form) that improves the efficiency of IFN signal transduction can result in improved control of viral infection [13] . These observations indicate that the IFN-signaling pathway is subject to a so-called ''rheo-STAT'' adjustment wherein downregulation causes increased susceptibility to viral infection whereas up-regulation might lead to increased efficiencies for IFNstimulated gene (ISG) expression and control of infection [14] .",

            "text": "In the present study, we aimed to mimic the beneficial actions of STAT1 modification with a small molecule that also enhances the activity of the IFN signaling pathway. We describe here the development of a high-throughput screening (HTS) system for novel small molecular weight compounds (so-called ''small molecules'') that might increase ISG expression and antiviral activity. To develop this screening system, we generated cell lines that stably express the human interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) driving a luciferase reporter gene. The ISRE gene promoter element is responsible for type I IFN signaling that mediates host defense against a wide range of viruses [15, 16] . After establishing that the ISRE-reporter cell line responded linearly to IFN-b concentration and treatment time, we converted the assay to an automated format for a screen against already approved or approvable drugs. We also screened a library of phosphatase inhibitors that might mediate increased STAT1 phosphorylationactivation. Our analysis identified a series of diverse compounds capable of significantly increasing ISRE activity. One compound in particular, the anthracycline antibiotic idarubicin hydrochloride, was used to explore mechanism of action and to validate the proposal that small molecules can enhance ISRE activity to drive higher levels of ISG expression and improved control of viral level. The findings provide for the concept that current antiviral therapeutics act directly and specifically on viral proteins whereas next-generation antivirals might act to enhance host immunity against a broad range of viruses. Either alone or together, these approaches might better address the current need for more effective treatment against common as well as new and emergent viral infections.",

We used 2fTGH cells (the parental line for STAT1-deficient U3A cells) as well as HEK293T cells that both express endogenous STAT1. Clonal lines showing IFN-b-inducible ISRE-promoter driven luciferase activity were designated 2fTGH-or HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells. For initial assay development, we used the 2fTGH-and HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells to establish an optimal luciferase light reaction time for both cell-lines. Based on luminescence signal stability over the time course of the reaction, an optimal readout window of 40-70 min after the start of the reaction was chosen for subsequent experiments ( Figure 2B ). After optimization of cell growth time, response to various IFN-b treatment times and concentrations were tested in 2fTGH and HEK293T cell lines. Each cell line exhibited a distinct IFN-b treatment time for maximal signal: 7-12 h for 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells and 14-24 h for HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells. Although a lower signal magnitude was obtained with 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells compared to HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells, the 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells show more specificity for IFN-b (compared to IFN-c) treatment at all IFN-b treatment time periods tested ( Figure 2E ) and over a range of IFN-b (and IFN-c) concentrations ( Figure 2F , G).

            "text": "The structure for idarubicin shows characteristic features of an anthracycline antibiotic unrelated to any other antiviral compound in clinical use. To further validate the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity, we tested three other anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin) with very similar chemical structures to idarubicin. Each of these compounds also showed a capacity to significantly increase ISRE activity ( Figure 5B ). In addition, we found that the immune activators DMXAA (Vadimezan) and Imiquimod did not cause any increase in ISRE activity in the same concentration range ( Figure 5C ). These compounds appear to directly activate immune cells (including increased IFN production) [21, 22] . However, for the present work, we specifically studied non-hematopoietic cells since that population appears critical for STAT1-mediated defense against at least some types of viruses [11] . We also found a cytotoxic effect of idarubicin that is consistent with previous observations [23, 24] . Under the present conditions, the major effect of idarubicin on cell viability was detected at drug concentrations .3 mM, so that the ISRE-activating effect of idarubicin occurred at concentrations below those that cause a major effect on cell viability ( Figure 5D ). Nonetheless, idarubicin is best known as an anti-neoplastic agent that acts via DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition [25] . To determine whether the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity is related to topoisomerase II inhibition, we tested three other potent topoisomerase inhibitors Etoposide, Hu-0331, and ICRF-193 up to concentrations known to cause topoisomerase II inhibition [26] [27] [28] . In contrast to idarubicin, these other compounds caused no significant increase in ISRE activity ( Figure 5E ). In fact, two of the topoisomerase inhibitors (Etoposide and Hu-0331) caused a decrease in ISRE activity in concert with cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations. These findings indicate that the capacity of idarubicin to activate the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway occurs independently of topoisomerase inhibition. Together, the findings provide evidence of idarubicin capacity to increase ISRE activity independent of the anti-neoplastic properties of the drug. We also observed that the effect of idarubin and the other anthracyclines on ISRE activity occurred at a lower concentration of drug when IFN-b was co-administered, particularly at the highest concentration of IFN-b (15 U/ml) ( Figure 5A ). For example, the EC 50 for idarubicin decreased as the concentration of IFN-b increased ( Table 2 ). These findings suggested that idarubicin might somehow interact with the IFN signaling pathway. In that regard, we also found that the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity was observed under baseline conditions when there was no detectable production of endogenous IFN-b and no administration of exogenous IFN-b (data not shown and Figure 5A ). These results suggested that the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity is independent of IFN production or action. Indeed, we also found that the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity persisted without change during effective IFN-a/b receptor 2 (IFNAR2) blockade ( Figure 6 ). Together, the findings indicate that idarubicin causes an increase in ISRE activity independent of IFN production or IFN-IFN-receptor interaction and instead acts downstream of ligandreceptor binding in the IFN signaling pathway.",

We selected EMCV since it was previously found to be sensitive to STAT1-CC-dependent improvement in IFN signaling [13] . In the present experiments, we found that idarubicin treatment (at a relatively low concentration of 25 nM) caused a significant decrease in EMCV titer at baseline and with IFN-b treatment (at a relatively low concentration of 5 U/ml) ( Figure 8A ). In addition, we observed that idarubicin-dependent improvement in viral control translates into a significant decrease in viral cytopathic effect under those same treatment conditions ( Figure 8B ). Higher concentrations of idarubicin in combination with IFN-b treatment caused a significant cytotoxic effect (data not shown), consistent with the antineoplastic properties of the drug. Nonetheless, the results with a relatively low concentration of idarubicin provide proof-of-concept that a small molecule activator of the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway will allow for increased ISG expression and improved control of viral level.",

We focused on the IFN system that is central to the antiviral response, although we recognized that other labs have pursued this target with limited success in the past. Some of these previous investigators have used administration of IFN itself to increase the antiviral response, but for this therapeutic goal and others, the side effects of IFN administration have proven to be rate-limiting [29] . Similarly, other investigators have attempted to boost IFN production, e.g., through administration Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists CpG or Imiquimod, but these agents have also caused similar side effects [30] [31] [32] [33] . The small molecule DMXAA activates multiple immune pathways (NF-kB, TBK1/IRF3, NOD, and MAP kinase) but was ineffective as an antiviral unless it was administered before infection [34] [35] [36] [37] . To circumvent at least some of these issues with IFN production, toxicity, and specificity, we therefore pursued the goal of antiviral drug discovery with a novel screening approach for identifying small molecule enhancers that might selectively boost the activity or efficiency of the IFN signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Our specific approach was based on previous success with the use of a modified STAT1 signaling pathway. In this work, we demonstrated that a designer form of STAT1 (designated STAT1-CC based on double-cysteine substitutions) was able to enhance IFN signaling and better control viral replication [13] . Although STAT1-CC gene expression would be challenging to translate to practical application, the mechanism of action served as a guide to design a screening strategy to identify small molecules that could mimic the antiviral benefit. In that regard, we also recognized that phenotypic screening approaches have proven to be more effective than target-based approaches for the discovery of first-in-class small molecule drugs [38] . Thus, target-based approaches (defined as direct drug action on a particular target) allow for analysis and refinement of structure and function but can also waste resources when the molecular hypotheses used to design screening assays may not be relevant to the disease. Meanwhile, phenotypic screening can take longer in terms of hit-to-lead development but provide more proteins in the pathway to be targeted and do not require prior knowledge of molecular mechanisms of action. Most importantly, the activity found in phenotypic-based approaches is often more effectively translated into therapeutic impact in disease models. For the present work, we take advantage of both of these strategies to some extent and devise a screen that incorporates molecular mechanism (i.e., enhancing a specific type of IFN signaling pathway) and the need to achieve phenotype (i.e., identifying any compound that could increase this type of signaling pathway regardless of specific mechanism).",

This assay proved to yield excellent signal-to-background and Z factors, specificity for IFN-b treatment over IFN-c treatment, and suitability for automation and screening. Furthermore, because the construct design uses the Click Beetle Green luciferase, the assay can be paired with other luciferase reporter genes to develop dual color assays to report activity of other signaling pathways, including the type II IFN-c activated sequence (GAS) promoter activity that mediates defense against intracellular bacteria. A related approach was used to screen for small molecules that increase GAS activity for anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells [39] . Others screened for compounds that inhibit Type I IFN production and signaling [40] . An ISRE-RFP reporter system has also been used to screen for assessing the effects of immunostimulatory RNA [41] . Others have used a less directed approach to screen for compounds that might use any mechanism to decrease viral levels [40, [42] [43] [44] [45] .

Subsequent validation assays demonstrated that idarubicin facilitates STAT1-dependent ISG expression and STAT1-directed control of viral replication and cytopathic effect. While others previously reported the antiviral properties of anthracyclines some time ago, no mechanism of their antiviral action was elucidated [46] [47] [48] . In the present study, we observed drug-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-range similar to those reported previously [23, 24] , however, we establish that the effect of idarubicin on the antiviral IFN pathway is independent of cytotoxicity and topoisomerase inhibition. Because idarubicin enhances the IFN signaling pathway output, we questioned whether the drug might also cause IFN-driven cell death. However, we found no increase in cytotoxicity in cells treated with idarubicin and IFN together compared to cells treated with idarubicin alone. We also found that the idarubicin concentrations for activating the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway were significantly less than those required for major cytotoxicity. Thus, we conclude that idarubicin effect on IFN signaling is distinct from the effect on DNA-based cytotoxicity. The dose dependency of these effects underlines the need to conduct screening at multiple concentrations of test compounds, particularly lower concentrations that prevent false negative hits due to cytotoxic effects.",

Our data further show that the enhancing effect of idarubicin is based on ISRE activation and ISG expression independent of IFN production or IFN-IFN-receptor interaction, since the effect of idarubicin is unchanged by IFNreceptor blockade. These findings suggest that idarubicin activation of the ISRE is due to an action in the IFN signaling pathway distal to ligand-receptor binding, e.g., at the level of receptorassociated JAK kinases or further downstream at the formation, transport, binding, and/or assembly of the ISRE transcriptional complex. In that regard, anthracyclines are known to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand to prevent replication, but whether this mechanism can affect ISRE or other gene promoter elements still needs to be defined. The present screening approach overcomes the uncertainty in molecular mechanism by using a phenotypic (rather than a target-based) screening approach and thereby captures compounds that increase the activity of the IFN signaling pathway by either established or undefined mechanisms.",

This approach is designed to lead to discovery of drugs with activity against a broad range of viruses for clinical application as well as experimental tool compounds to further understand IFN-dependent immune mechanisms. Current approaches to defining the basis for IFN signal transduction, particularly in vivo, often rely on complex transgenic and gene targeting approaches. Thus, the use of small molecule enhancers (SMEs) of the IFN signaling pathway may provide much greater flexibility and ease of application to achieve transient adjustment of IFN-related actions and consequent scientific and clinical benefit. Our approach should thereby prove useful to discover drugs with activity against a broad range of viruses as well as effectiveness in other conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis and melanoma) where the efficacy of IFN treatment might benefit from enhancing the IFN signaling pathway.",

Specifically, we used self-organizing maps analysis to cluster hit compounds by shape of the dose-response curve. The significance of change from dose to dose (0.24 to 1.2, 1.2 to 6, and 6 to 30) was also analyzed using linear models and moderated F-statistics as implemented in the limma package [57] in Bioconductor [55] . The concentration-response curves for each compound were then visually inspected, using scatter plots generated in TIBCO Spotfire DecisionSite (TIBCO, Palo Alto, CA), with respect to the shape of the curve and reproducibility between replicates. Compounds showing an erratic concentrationresponse (e.g. increase, then decrease, and increase again in ISRE activity with increasing concentration) were rejected. Compounds with a consistent increase or decrease in response with increasing drug concentration or good efficacy at any concentration were included for further validation. This approach led to selection of 64 compounds for further validation, including compounds with the 20 highest z-scores.",

For these experiments, U3A and U3A-STAT1 cells were first treated with the programmed combination of compound and IFN-b for 12 h and then were washed twice with cold Dulbecco's PBS followed by lysis with Cells-to-cDNA II lysis buffer (Life Technologies) and treatment with DNase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The U3A cells were obtained from G. Stark (Cleveland Clinic) and complemented with STAT1 to generate U3A-STAT1 cells as described previously [13] . A 25-ml aliquot of the cell lysate was used to generate cDNA using the High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). The resulting cDNA was quantified using the Quant-iT OliGreen ssDNA kit (Life Technologies). Average cDNA concentration was 71625 ng/ml. Subsequent PCR assays were performed in adherence with MIQE guidelines [60, 61] , including the design of assays for ISGs (OAS1 and GBP1) and normalizer gene ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ1). The normalizer gene OAZ1 was selected and validated for cell samples treated with and without IFN-b. In brief, candidate normalizer genes were selected from a combination of invariant genes selected from previous microarray data [11, 62, 63] and prior large-scale analyses of publicly available microarray data [64, 65] . These candidates were then tested using real-time quantitative PCR assays. Comparison of candidate normalizer gene expression between various IFN treatment and infection conditions using multiple software packages [66 68] led to the selection of the OAZ1 as the normalizer gene. Primers and probes for real-time quantitative PCR assays were designed using the ProbeFinder design algorithm (Roche Applied Science). For OAS1, 59ggtggagttcgatgtgctg-39 and 59-aggtttatagccgccagtca-39 were used as forward and reverse primers, along with UPL probe #37 (Roche Applied Science). A plasmid containing OAS1 transcript variant 2 cDNA (Ref ID NM_002534, Origene, Rockville, MD) was used as a standard for absolute quantitation of OAS1 copy number. For GBP1, 59-ttccaaaactaaaactctttcagga-39 and 59tgctgatggcattgacgtag-39 were used as forward and reverse primers, along with UPL probe #85. A plasmid containing the GBP1 cDNA (Clone ID: 3606865, Thermo Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was used as a standard. The IDT PrimeTime pre-designed assay Hs.PT.42.328511.g (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) was used for OAZ1. A cDNA vector was used for OAZ1 as well (Clone ID: LIFESEQ913650, Thermo Open Biosystems). Data were collected on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). Quantification cycle values were calculated using a second derivative maxima algorithm as implemented in the Lightcycler 480 software.",

Cells were then washed twice and cultured in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 28 h.

In addition, cell viability was determined using the Cellomics Arrayscan VTi high content imager (Thermo Scientific). For this assay, 15 images per well were obtained with a 10x objective. After background subtraction, cells were identified by nuclei stained by cell permeable dye Hoechst 33342. Propidium iodide fluorescence was quantified by defining a boundary of 2 pixels around the nuclei and then gating on a cell population that showed higher staining. For each sample replicate, cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of cells that showed increased propidium iodide staining based on samples of at least 5000 cells per well. ",
