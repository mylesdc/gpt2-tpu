Uncertainty still exists, partly because of the limited number of cases analysed. In this study, a full autopsy including 5 organ systems was conducted on a confirmed H5N1 human fatal case (male, 42 years old) within 18 hours of death. In addition to the respiratory system (lungs, bronchus and trachea), virus was isolated from cerebral cortex, cerebral medullary substance, cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus ileum, colon, rectum, ureter, aortopulmonary vessel and lymph-node. Real time RT-PCR evidence showed that matrix and hemagglutinin genes were positive in liver and spleen in addition to positive tissues with virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization stains showed accordant evidence of viral infection with real time RT-PCR except bronchus. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that a high viral load was associated with increased host responses, though the viral load was significantly different in various organs. Cells of the immunologic system could also be a target for virus infection. Overall, the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus was associated both with virus replication and with immunopathologic lesions. In addition, immune cells cannot be excluded from playing a role in dissemination of the virus in vivo.",

            "text": "Influenza pandemic are characterized by the worldwide spread of novel influenza strains for which most of the population lacks substantial immunity [1, 2] . Pandemic viruses typically cause heightened morbidity and mortality [1] . The continued circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses H5N1 has resulted in occasional coincident infections among humans. Since late 2003, when widespread H5N1 virus poultry outbreaks were reported in multiple countries in Asia, there have been 467 laboratory confirmed human cases in ten countries reported to the World Health Organization as of December 2009 with a mortality rate of about 60% [3, 4] . Global public health concerns surrounding H5N1 viruses include not only individual transmission events between infected poultry and individual humans, but also their pandemic potential, should these viruses acquire genetic changes that result in sustained human-to-human transmission. To date, several case clusters of H5N1 infections have been reported [5] and limited epidemiologic information has suggested person-to-person transmission of H5N1 in a few instances, usually involving family members. Of additional concern to both human and animal health, is the extensive geographic spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses in recent years and their isolation from multiple species of wild birds and mammals [6] [7] [8] [9] . Despite the recent emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10] , the pandemic threat from HPAI H5N1 viruses has not diminished [11] .",

The elevation of plasma cytokine levels was positively correlated with pharyngeal viral load [23] and may simply reflect more extensive viral replication, and consequently, direct viral pathology rather than being causative of the pathology observed in H5N1-infected patients.

Although H5N1 virus infection of humans is primarily one of the lower respiratory tract, more recent reports suggested that influenza A H5N1 may in rare, severe cases, disseminate beyond the lungs and infect brain [26, 27] , intestines [20, 27] and lymphoid tissues [27] , and result in extra-pulmonary clinical manifestations including encephalopathy or encephalitis [15, 28] . This extrapulmonary dissemination of HPAI H5N1 virus contrasts with seasonal influenza virus infection of humans which, even in fatal cases, is restricted to the respiratory tract. However, there have been relatively few reports describing histopathology and virus distribution in H5N1 cases [5, 16, 21, 24, 26, 27] . To better understand the pathogenesis of human H5N1 virus infection, and investigate the route of virus dissemination in vivo, we report on the use of different techniques to detect virus distribution and infection of 5 organ systems in a laboratory confirmed fatal human H5N1 virus infection, and analyze the relationship between viral load in tissues and host response. Our results suggested that the virus can infect multi-organs besides pulmonary. High viral load is associated with increased host response though the viral load is significantly difference in various organs.

As shown in Table 1 , live virus was recovered from respiratory tissues including lung, trachea, bronchus and aortopulmonary vessel. In the digestive system, virus was isolated from tissues collected from the ileum, colon and rectum, but not the stomach, duodenum or liver. Of note, virus culture was also positive on tissues collected from brains, ureter and axillary lymph-node. Sequencing results showed that the sequences of isolates are identical. Real time RT-PCR results were consistent with the detection of virus by culture, except for the liver and spleen tissues which were positive by real time RT-PCR but negative for virus isolation. The tissue distribution of viral RNA or antigen detected by ISH and IHC stains respectively, was also generally consistent with virus isolation by culture or real time RT-PCR result. However, several exceptions were noted. There was a lack of detectable staining by either method in bronchus tissue, despite virus detection. On the other hand, both staining methods detected viral product in the kidney, although virus isolation and real time PCR were both negative.",

The relative H5N1 viral load in different tissues by determining the ratio of viral HA copy number relative to the copy number of the beta actin gene for a given tissue sample. Tissues of the respiratory system yielded higher copy number ratios than tissues from all to other organ systems with the lower left lung lobe yielding the highest viral load, overall. Interestingly, ureter tissue had the highest viral load of non respiratory system tissues. All other tissues had lower viral loads that were not. Among the digestive system tissues, the viral load in the liver was the highest (See Fig. S1 ). Additionally, we detected mRNA copies of macrophage attractant chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 3b (MIP-3b), RANTES, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNFa in tissues of brain, respiratory organ, spleen and lymph-node. RANTES and TRAIL can be detected in all selected tissues. MIP-3b is positive in selected tissues except right upper lobe lung with positive b-actin. IP-10 can be determined copies in cerebral context, left upper lobe lung, left lower lobe lung, right middle lobe lung, right lower lobe lung, and aortopulmonary vessel. TNF-a can be showed copies in left upper lobe lung, left lower lobe lung, right middle lobe lung, right lower lobe lung, aortopulmonary vessel and spleen. The correlation among levels of viral load and were showed by Fig. 1 . The Pearson's cross correlation analysis (See Table S1 ) showed that high viral load is associated with high host response figured out by proinflammatory factors (p,0.05) except TNF-a (P.0.05), and the correlation is significant between proinflammatory factors except between TRAIL and TNF-a (p.0.05), and between TRAIL and IP-10(p.0.05) as well.",

Lung showed diffused alveolar damages including intraalveolar edema, focal intra-alveolar hemorrhage, necrosis of alveolar line cells, focal desquamation of pneumocytes in alveolar spaces, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates, and extensive hyaline membranes. Trachea showed focal denudation of the epithelium with edema, and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates. Spleen showed depletion of lymphocytes with congestion and organized infarcts. Axillary lymph-node was congested with depletion of lymphocytes. The central nervous system showed extensive edema with focal neuronal necrosis in hippocampus. Diastem between Purkinje cells layer and particle cells layer showed focal augmentation in cerebellum. Liver was congested with edema and focal fatty degeneration. Kidney was congested with edema. Other selected tissues showed no significant histological changes. (Fig. 3I ). As influenza virus is a negative-strand RNA virus, ISH stain with sense and antisense probes detected both virus RNA (with sense probe), mRNA and cRNA(with anti-sense probe). ISH stain showed that the two sets of probes (for hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) generated similar staining results. In the selected 24 autopsy tissue from 5 organ systems, positive staining of ISH was detected in all samples except Bronchus, stomach and duodenum. In the lung tissue samples, sense probes extensively hybridized in the nuclei of pneumocytes (Fig. 4A) , whereas antisense probes hybridized in both the cytoplasm and nuclei. In all other organs with positive staining, both sense and antisense were present mainly in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In respiratory system, the positive staining was found in epithelial cell of lung ( ",

Our results presented that the viral antigens or viral RNA can be found in trachea, lung, brain, intestines, liver, spleen, lymph-node and kidney which were reported as same before [20, 26, 27, 30] , as well as in aortopulmonary vessel and ureter which were not reported before. Notably, the virus can be found in tissues of lower gastrointestinal tract including small intestine and large intestine but in stomach and duodenum. The origin of infection in the extrapulmonary organs could be blood-borne, which is supported by previous studies showing live H5N1 virus can be isolated from the serum [20] and plasma [31] . Unfortunately, we haven't obtained blood samples to [25, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] and T lymphocytes [37] . The viral load shows various levels in different organs although the virus can be found in multiple organs. Quantitative detection of viral gene showed that viral load is the highest in tissues of respiratory system, especially, in left lower lobe of lung. The liver had the highest viral load in tissues of digestive system. Interestingly, renal duct showed a high viral load although PCR detection of kidney was negative. And viral load was high in spleen and lymphonode. Despite of the viral cells tropism, possible reasons of different viral load could include activation of low PH [38] , viral receptor distribution [39] , cell N-linked glycoprotein distribution [40] or other unknown mechanisms. On other hand, non-permissive or abortive infection is extra possible in some of the tissues where the virus cannot replicate effectively. Additionally, it should be possible that phagocytosis of viral antigen from pathologically significant lytic/replicative infection caused positively viral detection in these tissues.",

            "text": "High viral load is associated with increased host responses. To be different with seasonal influenza virus, the H5N1 virus caused intense transcription induction and secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, as documented in human cases [15, 22] , and increased induction of cytokines and chemokines has been demonstrated in H5N1-infected mice [41] . Moreover, High virulence of H5N1 virus is associated with increase with increased host responses [42] . However, the relationship between viral load and host immuno-response has never been reported. Our study suggested that the high viral load is correlated with proinflamatory factors including IP-10, RANTES, MIP-3b and TRAIL. This finding is particularly relevant to the mechanism of H5N1 pathogenesis which is associated not only with the virus but also with the host responses. Inflammatory protein can be produced by almost any infected cells and by immune cells, including alveolar macrophages [43] . However, type II pneumocytes have a marked ability to secrete large amounts of cytokines, such as TNF-a, GM-CSF, MCP, and IL-8, in response to various insults [44, 45] and can be induced to secrete IL-1a, IL-6, RANTES, and MCP-1, in response to TNF-a [45, 46] , the last being produced by alveolar macrophages during H5N1 infection. Therefore, it is possible that the much greater cytokine induction by the H5N1 virus was as much a consequence of the response of individual, infected cells as it was a consequence of the numbers of infected cells.",

Previous findings showed that viral sequences and antigens have been detected in lymphocytes in lymph node tissue, as well as in Hofbauer cells (macrophages of the placenta), Kupffer cells (macrophages of the liver), and mononuclear cells in the intestinal mucosa [27] . This is consistent with our find. Our presented evidence shows that virus can be detected in macrophage. Moreover, our finding showed that viral RNA can be detected in CD3+ T lymphocytes, progenitor cells and follicular dendritic cells of spleen. The spleen is a complex organ with several functions, including the removal of senescent or aberrant red blood cells from circulation, as well as the removal of circulating pathogenic organisms [47] . So circulationg immune cell with H5N1 virus could play a role in dissemination of virus when those cells with virus can not remove the virus in cells completely. We unprecedentedly investigated 24 autopsy tissues of 5 organ systems from a dead patient of H5N1 infection. Our study results indicate that the H5N1 virus could be found in multiple organs. Viral load in infected tissues is correlated with host response. And circulating immune cell can not be excluded to play a role in dissemination of virus in vivo.",
