            "text": "It was found that high-affinity anti-DNA antibodies were one of the major components of the intrathecal IgG response in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients [Williamson et al., PNAS, 2001]. Recently we have shown that IgGs from the sera of MS patients are active in the hydrolysis of DNA. Here we have shown, for the first time, that average concentration of total proteins (132-fold), total IgGs (194-fold) and anti-DNA antibodies (200-fold) in the sera is significantly higher than that in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of fifteen MS patients. The relative activities of total protein from sera and CSFs varied remarkably from patient to patient. It was surprising that the specific DNase activity of the total protein of CSF reparations were 198fold higher than the serum ones. Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the CSF proteins on protein G-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration. We present first evidence showing that IgGs from CSF not only bind but efficiently hydrolyze DNA and that average specific DNase activity of homogeneous antibodies from CSF is unpredictably ,49-fold higher than that from the sera of the same MS patients. Some possible reasons of these findings are discussed. We suggest that DNase IgGs of CSF may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and MS pathogenesis development.

Its etiology remains unclear, and the most valid theory of its pathogenesis assigns the main role in the destruction of myelinproteolipid shell of axons to inflammation related with autoimmune reactions ( [1] and refs therein). Although the T-cell immune system plays a leading role in MS pathogenesis, normal functioning of the B-cell system is also important for the disease development. An enhanced synthesis of immunoglobulins (usually IgGs), their free light chains, and of polyspecific DNA binding antibodies (Abs) interacting with phospholipids are observed in MS patients [1] .",

It was found that high affinity anti-DNA Abs were a major component of the intrathecal IgG response in MS patients. Furthermore, DNA-specific monoclonal Abs derived from two MS individuals as well as a DNA-specific Ab derived from a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient bound efficiently to the surface of neuronal cells and oligodendrocytes. For these Abs, cell-surface recognition was DNA-dependent. The findings indicate that anti-DNA Abs may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in chronic inflammatory disorders, such as MS and SLE [2] .",

Artificial abzymes are abzymes against analogs of transition states of catalytic reactions [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] or antiidiotypic Abs induced by a primary antigen, which may show some of its features including the catalytic activity (for review also see [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ). During past two decades it has become clear that auto-antibodies (auto-Abs) from the sera of patients with different autoimmune diseases can possess enzymatic activities and that their occurrence is a distinctive feature of autoimmune diseases (reviewed in [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] ). It is thought that abzymes may play a significant role in forming specific pathogenic patterns and clinical settings in different autoimmune conditions through their broadened auto-Ab properties [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Patients with autoimmune diseases produce Abs to nucleoprotein complexes, to DNA and to enzymes that participate in nucleic acid metabolism [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In autoimmune diseases, there can be a spontaneous induction of anti-idiotypic antibodies, which are Abs elicited by a primary antigen, including some with catalytic activity, or transition from polyreactive catalytic activity to autoantigen-directed activity. Natural abzymes hydrolyzing DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, oligopeptides, and proteins are present in the serum of patients with several autoimmune and viral diseases (reviewed in [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] ). Healthy humans do not develop abzymes with detectable DNase and RNase activities, their levels being usually on the borderline of sensitivity of the detection methods [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Then, it was shown that IgGs and IgMs from the sera of MS patients effectively hydrolyzed DNA, RNA, and oligosaccharides [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Whereas only 18 and 53% of MS patients contained increased concentrations of Abs to native and denatured DNA, respectively, as compared with healthy donors, DNase abzymes were found in ,80-90% of MS patients [17, 24, 25] . Since DNase abzymes of MS patients [14] similarly to SLE patients [28] are cytotoxic, cause nuclear DNA fragmentation and induce cell death by apoptosis, they can play an important role in SLE and MS pathogenesis. Taking these observations into account, analysis of relative concentrations of proteins, canonical enzymes and DNase abzymes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients is of special interest.",

Preparations of total protein were capable to hydrolyze supercoiled plasmid DNA (scDNA), forming single breaks in one strand of supercoiled DNA (relaxed DNA) and then multiple breaks yielding linear DNA. Finally, they hydrolyzed DNA into short and medium-length oligonucleotides. However, after such a deep hydrolysis of DNA, it was very difficult to estimate the relative activity of these preparations. The RAs of total protein from sera and CSF varied remarkably from patient to patient. Fig. 1 illustrates typical examples of cleavage of scDNA by total protein from several MS patients after 2 h of incubation. Therefore, in order to estimate the DNase activity quantitatively, we found the concentration for each preparation and the time of incubation sufficient to convert scDNA into the relaxed form (10-40%; for example, lanes 2, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Fig. 1C ) without further noticeable fragmentation after 1-2 h of incubation. Since all measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses and protein concentration, the measured RAs were normalized to standard conditions (pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h; standard units (SU)) ( Table 3 ). The relative specific DNase activity of total protein of the serum preparations was varied in the range 0.26-0.88 pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h (average value 0.5160.16 SU). It was surprising that the specific activity of the total protein of CSF reparations were 198-fold higher (range 25-263 SU, average value 101650 SU) than the serum ones (Table 3) . At the same time, concentration of total protein in the case of CSF was 130-fold lower than that of sera (Table 2) . Therefore, in calculation on 1 ml of liquid the average RA of total protein corresponding to the sera was only 1.5-fold lower than that for CSFs.",

The relative amount of CSF preparations from only thirteen MS patients was enough for the purification of IgG preparations. To analyze the ''average'' situation for MS IgGs, we prepared a mixture of equal amounts of IgGs from sera of thirteen patients (IgG mix ). The homogeneity of the 150 kDa IgG mix was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band before, and two bands corresponding to the H and L chains after Ab reduction with DTT (silver staining) ( Fig. 2A) . To prove that DNase activity of CSF IgG mix is its intrinsic property and is not due to copurifying enzymes, we applied some of well known rigid criteria [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 33] ; a) electrophoretic homogeneity of IgG mix ( Fig. 2A) ; b) gel-filtration of IgG mix in conditions of ''acidic shock'' (pH 2.6) did not lead to the disappearance of Ab activity and the peak of activity tracked exactly with 150 kDa Abs (Fig. 2C) ; c) complete adsorption of the activity by Sepharose bearing monoclonal mouse Abs against human IgG light chains and its elution from the adsorbent with buffer of low pH (Fig. 2D ).",

Since all measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses and Ab concentration curves, the measured RAs for individual IgGs were normalized to standard conditions similarly to those for the preparation of total protein (Table 3) .",

Data reported in this paper provide strong evidence that DNase activity is an intrinsic property of IgGs present in CSF of MS patients: it is not due to copurifying enzymes. The presence of anti-DNA Abs and DNase IgGs in CSF of MS patients is in agreement with the detection of B-cells producing anti-DNA Abs directly in active plaques and periplaque regions in MS brain and cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with MS [2] . Since sera of MS patients contain greater number of different proteins than CSFs (Fig. 1A ) and the average concentration of total protein in the sera is ,130-fold higher than in CSFs, it is not surprising that average specific RA of CSF total protein is 198-fold higher than that of the serum one. The question is why specific RAs of CSF total IgGs are significantly (48.5-fold) more active than those from sera. In addition, relative concentration of Abs (of a total pool) interacting with DNA in sera is ,1986-fold higher than in CSF, while a difference in the concentration of total IgGs is only 198-fold, a difference of 10.3-fold (Table 2) . Thus, a small specific fraction of anti-DNA Abs from the CSF may be 10-fold more active (totally ,485-fold) than a similar small fraction of Abs interacting with DNA from the sera. In this context, some data from literature should be mentioned.",

Since the specific activity was calculated using the total concentration of IgGs, the specific DNase activities of the individual monoclonal subfractions in a polyclonal IgG pool may be significantly higher than those of the nonfractionated IgGs. In addition, the repertoire of polyclonal Abs against different antigens in the case of sera from MS patients may be significantly wider than that of CSFs.

It was recently shown that the specific reorganization of immune system during the spontaneous development of a profound SLE-like pathology in MRL-lpr/lpr mice is associated with changes in the differentiation profile and the level of proliferation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and with the production of DNase, ATPase, and amylase abzymes [35, 36] . Immunization of healthy mice with DNA also leads to a production of Abs with DNase activity; however, it is only associated with increased lymphocyte proliferation and suppression of apoptosis of lymphocytes in different organs (especially spleen), but not with a change in the differentiation of bone marrow cells [35, 36] . Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that B-cells of CSF of MS patients can produce not only Abs interacting with DNA [2] , but also specific anti-DNA abzymes with higher DNase activity. Abzymes produced by lymphocytes against DNA in different organs of MS patients (and circulating in the blood system) may have a lower DNase activity in comparison with anti-DNA Abs of CSF or may be different ratio of abzymes and anti-DNA Abs without catalytic activity in the CSFs and sera of MS patients.",

It was shown that there was no good correlation between several identical indexes characterizing CSFs and sera of MS patients, CCs varying in the range of 20.12 to +0.57 (Tables 2  and 3 ). The correlation between the total protein concentration and: a) total concentration of IgGs in CSF (CC = +0.17; columns 1 and 3) and sera (CC = +0.47; columns 2 and 4); b) relative concentration of anti-DNA Abs in CSF (CC = +0.11; columns 1 and 5) or sera (CC = 20.04; columns 2 and 6) was low ( Table 2) . At the same time, low but still the best positive correlation was observed between the total protein concentration and relative DNase activity of total CSF protein (CC = +0.61; columns 1 and 7), whereas in the sera these values showed negative correlation (CC = 20.49; columns 2 and 8) (Tables 2 and 3) . Similar low CCs were observed for other estimated parameters. CC between the relative concentrations of IgGs and anti-DNA Abs was relatively low in CSF (CC = +0.4; columns 3 and 5), and negative in the sera (CC = 20.32; columns 4 and 6) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, CC between the concentration of IgGs and the relative specific DNase activity of CSF Abs (CC = +0.16; columns 3 and 11) was lower than that of the sera (CC = 20.58; columns 4 and 12) (Tables 1  and 2 ). Finally, the relative concentration of total anti-DNA Abs correlated with the relative specific IgG DNase activity better in the sera (CC = +0.51; columns 6 and 12) than in CSF (CC = + 0.11; columns 5 and 11) (Tables 2 and 3 ). An additional question is why there is no good correlation between various indexes, characterizing different MS patients. An analysis of correlation between titers of Abs to DNA as well as to MBP and 13 different standard clinical parameters including Poser criteria (indexes for evaluation of damage to functional systems: pyramidal functions; cerebellar functions; functions of brain stem; sensitive functions; functions of intestines and urinary bladder; visual functions; cerebral (psychical) functions and sum of these characteristics) in the case of 49 patients with MS was carried out [17] . For the whole group of MS patients, the absolute values of positive CCs between titers of anti-DNA or anti-MBP Abs and clinical Poser indexes were very low (between 0.01 and 0.19), absent (,0), or even negative (20.02 to 20.07) and statistically non-significant. Several CCs became higher and reached values up to 0.1 to 0.55 and 20.04 to 20.47 after the division of cohort into subgroups of patients with primary progressing, secondary progressing and remitting course of the disease [17] .",

            "text": "The absence of a definite dependence between titers of anti-DNA and anti-MBP Abs and these parameters with standard clinical indices may be due to several reasons. MS is an extremely multifactorial disease, in which similar pathomorphological and clinical indices manifested as MS may result from very different underlying processes and conditions [37, 38] . For example, in each MS patient, the ''relative stability'' of different organs and their functions to the destructive effect of transient immune system errors can be significantly different depending on the genetic background and environmental stress factors, including geographic ones [37] [38] [39] . Some proteins of influenza, herpes, polyoma, Epstein-Barr and other viruses and of some bacteria have been reported to mimic human myelin proteins, and these infections can therefore lead to immunization with their proteins and stimulate the subsequent formation of Abs to myelin and finally to the development of autoimmune reactions [38, [40] [41] [42] [43] . In individual MS patients, the development of autoimmune reactions can be stimulated by different viral or bacterial infections as well as various toxic chemicals. Furthermore, it should also be taken into account that MS is pathology of at least two-phases [44] . The cascade of reactions corresponding to the first inflammatory phase is very complicated and involves many proteins, enzymes, cytokines, and chemokines inducing macrophages and other cells producing NO N radicals and osteopathin [38, 44] . The complex and coordinated action of T-and B-cells, complement system, inflammation mediators, and auto-Abs result in the formation of demyelinization nodi and interruption of axon conductivity. The neurodegenerative phase of MS that ensues later is directly connected with the neural tissue destruction in these patients [38, 44] . Therefore, any analysis of biochemical, immunological and clinical indices must take into account of the current stage of the disease. Obviously, quite different characteristics of pathologic processes can be obtained in individual patients as the disease progresses against the background of the continually changing immunoregulation, including exhaustion of different compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and systemic metabolic changes. This makes the clinical course of MS hardly predictable in individual patients [38, 44] . Therefore, it is not surprising that we could not find a high statistically significant correlation of titers of Abs to DNA and RAs of abzymes with all parameters measured, since each patient can be characterized by an individual combination of genetic, environmental, chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating, neurodegenerative and other factors.",

The images of ethidium bromidestained gels were captured on a Sony DSC-F717 camera and a relative amount of DNA in different bands was analyzed using ImageQuant v5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). The activities of IgG preparations were determined as a decrease in the percentage of DNA converted from the initial supercoiled form to the relaxed form, corrected for the distribution of DNA between these bands in the control (incubation of pBluescript in the absence of Abs). All measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses (15-40% of DNA hydrolysis) and then recalculated to the standard conditions (see Tables) .",
