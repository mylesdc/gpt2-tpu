No direct evidence indicates that these new viruses arose as a result of recombination between genotype C and D or a result of convergence. In this study, we search for evidence of intra-individual recombination in the family cluster cases with co-circulation of genotype C, D and C/ D recombinants. We studied 68 individuals from 15 families with HBV infections in 2006, identified individuals with mixed HBV genotype co-infections by restriction fragment length polymorphism and proceeded with cloning and DNA sequencing. Recombination signals were detected by RDP3 software and confirmed by split phylogenetic trees. Families with mixed HBV genotype co-infections were resampled in 2007. Three of 15 families had individuals with different HBV genotype co-infections in 2006. One individual (Y2) had a triple infection of HBV genotype C, D and C/D recombinant in 2006, but only genotype D in 2007. Further clonal analysis of this patient indicated that the C/D recombinant was not identical to previously isolated CD1 or CD2, but many novel recombinants with C2, D1 and CD1 were simultaneously found. All parental strains could recombine with each other to form new recombinant in this patient. This indicates that the detectable mixed infection and recombination have a limited time window. Also, as the recombinant nature of HBV precludes the possibility of a simple phylogenetic taxonomy, a new standard may be required for classifying HBV sequences.",

For samples needing further recombination analysis, PCR was performed using the primers and thermocycling conditions described by G\u00fcnther to obtain full-length HBV genome [11] . Alternatively, a nested PCR was used to produce two overlapping fragments in subjects with low HBV DNA levels as described by Sugauchi et al [12] . The spanning of fragment A cover nucleotides 2813 to 1824, and fragment B included nucleotides 1821 to 237. LA-Taq (TAKARA, Japan) and high-fidelity polymerase COD-FX (TOYOBO, Japan) were used to produce amplimers for cloning and direct sequencing respectively. Finally, Fragment C (HBV nt56-nt1824) was obtained from a PCR amplification of Y2 HBV-DNA to which an aliquot of genotype B HBV-DNA had been added. The purpose of this experiment with in-tube control of genotype B was to determine if the recombinant clones were being generated during the PCR amplification. PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the PMD19-T vector (TAKARA, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and used to transform JM109 competent cells (TAKARA, Japan). A minimum of 15 clones were sequenced from subjects with a mixed-strain infection and three clones were sequenced from family members with a single-strain infection. All sequencing of clones and PCR products was performed by Invitrogen Ltd. (Shanghai, China).",

Some studies show that hotspots of recombination most on the boundary of ORFs [12, 20] . Our results showed that two or more strains of HBV can recombine with each other at any region along the genome. Crossover regions can be hundreds or just several base pairs, The length of crossover region is depends on the location of it on HBV genome. If it is located in a conserved HBV region, for another word, where many different genotypes share the same sequence, the length of crossover region may be long. If it is located in a non-conserved region, it may be very short. At the same time, we found that the crossover region distributed totally at random on HBV genome. Consistent with our results, in vitro evidence showed the initial recombination events in a laboratory system of MHV were almost entirely randomly distributed along the sequence [21] . It was only after passage through cell culture, with the opportunity for selection to remove less fit variants, that crossover sites became ''localized'' to just a small area of the region examined. Crucially, they also suggested initial products of recombination may go undetected because of the action of strong purifying selection which will remove new, deleterious combinations of mutations. The conclusion is therefore an interpretation for the genotype change of Y2. The Y2 presented multiple strain infections of C2/D1/CD1 and many new recombinants with no obvious dominant genotype strain in 2006. After 18 months, however, all the type C2 and CD recombinant strains disappeared while the D strain became dominant. A similar case of mixed HBV genotype infection in which one genotype was lost and another prevailed was previously described in patients with HBeAg seroconversion [4, 22] .",

Precise mapping of recombination suggests C2 and D1 are parental sequences of CD1 and CD2 recombinants. Virological differences among HBV genotypes were demonstrated in vitroand in CHiM mice, with genotype C having a higher replication capacity than D [23] . Why does the replication-deficient genotype D virus predominate over replication-competent genotype C? As mixed HBV infections together with recombination are rare, we have little knowledge about i this situation. On the one hand, we know little about host impact on different genotypes and recombinants. On the other hand, we know little about interference and competition in the quasispecies of mixed infection. In vitro results showed the replication capacity of individual clone, exclude the influence of host and other strains of quasi-species. An example from a ChiM mice study showed that monoinfection of HBV/G in ChiM mice display a very slow replication while coinfection with HBV/A remarkably enhanced the replication of HBV/G. The replication of HBV/G is heavily dependent on coinfection with other genotypes. When HBV/G superinfected on other genotypes, a rapidly takes over of HBV/G from original genotype were observed, though they are indispensable [24] . This study confirms that in a mixed infection system of different genotypes, the replication capacity of a genotype may be different from that of monoinfection. At the same time, replication capacity is not the only factor to influence which strain will become dominant. Variable recombinants found in our study may be mechanistically capable of genetic exchange, but strong selection guaranteed the elimination of hybrid genomes. The mechanism of selection in mixed infection also needs more investigation.",

Even so, evolutionarily visible and invisible recombination of HBV could occur and play an important role by generating genetic variation or reducing mutational load.

Some of these recombinants are unique to individual subjects, but some undergo expansion in specific populations and become recognized as new genotypes or subgenotypes [12, 28, 29, 30] . Four stages in the process of generating popular HBV recombinant genomes should be recognized. The first stage is the co-circulation of different HBV strains or genotypes in the same geographic area. The second is the existence of individuals who have been infected with more than one strain of HBV. The third is the generation of a novel recombinant strain(s) within an individual. The fourth is the selection of a recombined strain with the ability to replicate and be transmitted.

There are some characteristic length differences between the genotypes that facilitates their detection and discrimination. However, as shown in Figure 2 , existence of a recombinant makes the topology of the phylogenetic tree totally different from one with no recombinant. Recombinant strains obscured the definition of genotypes. Based on the algorithm creating a phylogenetic tree, sequences with high homologues cluster together. With the same logic, recombinants always clustered with the backbone parental sequence, in other words, with which they have high similarity with the larger proportion of the recombination region. Therefore, recombinants always seem to be a subgenotype of their backbone parental sequence. Similar to Y2-8 clone in Figure 2C , for recombinants with similar proportion of both parental genotypes, the sequence shows a divergent trend different from both parental genotypes.",

Furthermore, Subgenotype Ba possesses the recombination with genotype C at 1740 to 2485 [31, 32, 33] .
