However, the primary drawback of this approach is poor cell and in vivo oligonucleotide uptake efficacy. Biological activities can be significantly enhanced through the use of synthetically conjugated cationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). Studies to date have focused on the delivery of a single SSO conjugated to a CPP, but here we describe the conjugation of two phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) SSOs to a single CPP for simultaneous delivery and pre-mRNA targeting of two separate genes, exon 23 of the Dmd gene and exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene, in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conjugations of PMOs to a single CPP were carried out through an amide bond in one case and through a triazole linkage ('click chemistry') in the other. The most active bi-specific CPP-PMOs demonstrated comparable exon skipping levels for both pre-mRNA targets when compared to individual CPP-PMO conjugates both in cell culture and in vivo in the mdx mouse model. Thus, two SSOs with different target sequences conjugated to a single CPP are biologically effective and potentially suitable for future therapeutic exploitation.",

Such SSOs are designed to sterically block splice sites or specific binding motifs for splicing machinery in order to promote exon inclusion or exclusion. For DMD, targeting of the dystrophin pre-mRNA with a SSO is used to 'skip' an exon that contains a nonsense coding mutation, or to remove an exon neighbouring an out-of-frame genomic deletion, so as to restore the mRNA reading frame. This allows synthesis of an internally deleted dystrophin protein that retains the elements crucial for function (1) (2) (3) .",

Various SSO chemistries have been developed for exon skipping including phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), locked nucleic acid (LNA), 2 -O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (2 -MOE/PS), 2 -Omethyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (2 -OMe/PS) and tricyclo oligonucleotides (see (2) for a recent review). The two major SSO chemistries that have been used more extensively and which are in current clinical trials in DMD patients are 2 -OMe/PS (9, 11) and PMO (8, 10, 12) . In these trials, production of dystrophin protein has been demonstrated, albeit at low levels, and rather disappointingly a recent phase III trial with 2 -OMe-PS SSO was not able to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in the 6 min walk test (13) . Nevertheless, preliminary results with PMO chemistry are promising and further studies are planned to target additional exons (8, 9) . To date, clinical trials have focused on targeted removal of exon 51, since this would benefit the largest patient pool, but SSOs are also being developed to target other exons between 45 and 55.",

            "text": "The most significant barrier to success for spliceswitching therapies has been effective delivery. In the case of PMO, and indeed other chemistries, the level of exon skipping, and hence the amount of functional dystrophin restored in muscle, is poor unless high doses are used. This is thought to be due mostly to their rapid clearance from the body following systemic administration, as well as their poor ability to penetrate cellular barriers and reach their nuclear target site. One approach to address this has been to attach cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that can effectively carry charge neutral PMO cargos across cell membranes to their pre-mRNA target site in the nucleus. In particular, PMOs conjugated to arginine-rich CPPs (known as P-PMOs) have been shown to enhance dystrophin production in muscle following systemic administration in the mdx mouse model of DMD (14) (15) (16) . We have previously developed a series of novel arginine-rich CPPs known as PNA/PMO internalization peptides (Pips), comprised of two arginine-rich sequences separated by a central short hydrophobic core sequence. These Pip peptides were designed to improve serum stability whilst maintaining a high level of exon skipping, initially by attachment to a PNA cargo (17) . Further derivations of these peptides were designed as conjugates of PMOs, which were shown to lead to high body-wide skeletal muscle dystrophin production, and importantly also including the heart, following systemic administration (5) . A later version (Pip6a-PMO) proved to be an even more efficient conjugate in mediating dystrophin production in the mdx mouse (18) .",

Myostatin is involved in control of myogenesis through binding to activin type IIB receptor (AcvRIIb) (20, 21) which recruits and activates activin type I receptor (ALK4 or ALK5) (22) . Activin receptor activation results in phosphorylation of intracellular signalling mediators Smad2 and Smad3 that translocate to the nucleus to affect gene transcription. There is evidence that inhibition of the myostatin pathway has the potential for clinical benefit in DMD. Transgenic knockout models for both myostatin and dystrophin demonstrate increased musculature due to fibre hypertrophy as well as reduced fibrosis and fat deposition, compared to mdx mice alone (23) . Similarly, when mdx mice were treated with anti-myostatin antibodies this resulted in enlarged muscles concurrent with improved muscle function and strong reduction in diaphragm fibrosis (24) . Based on these improved muscle features, the concept of myostatin down-regulation concurrent with dystrophin restoration has been investigated. Dumonceaux et al. reported the use of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) constructs to combine RNAi-mediated down-regulation of AcvRIIB with a U7-based small RNA exon skipping technique to restore dystrophin (25) . Whilst concurrent treatment did not improve muscle mass, absolute and specific forces were much greater compared to either individual strategy. A subsequent study by Hoogaars et al., utilized soluble AcvRIIB decoy receptors in combination with AAV-U7 mediated dystrophin restoration to treat mdx mice (26) . Treatment with decoy AcvRIIB increased body weight, with morphometric measurements of muscle fibres suggesting that muscle growth was due to hypertrophy (20, 21, 27) . Based on the potential success of this approach, we sought to simultaneously target both the dystrophin and the myostatin pathway as a molecular model to evaluate the efficacy of using bi-specific PMO compounds.",

Whilst the principle of multiple-exon targeting for both dystrophin restoration and myostatin depletion has been demonstrated before using a cocktail of individual SSOs (30) (31) (32) , there are advantages in development of a bi-specific compound to target two pre-mRNAs. First, the outcome of use of a bi-specific SSO is that both SSOs must enter the same cell, whereas for a cocktail of SSOs there will likely be a mixed population of cells where either none, one or both genes are targeted. More importantly, since cell and in vivo toxicity of P-PMOs is thought to be predominantly due to that of the peptide, the use of a single peptide to deliver both PMOs halves the total peptide requirement compared to use of a cocktail of two separate P-PMOs, and this may help to reduce the potential for peptide-mediated toxicity. Note also that two 2 -OMe/PS SSOs that target both dystrophin and myostatin have been joined together recently to make a bi-specific construct, but without any attached delivery peptide, but in this case activity in mdx mice was not seen for the dystrophin SSO (33) .",

Three different conjugation chemistries including amide, disulfide and triazole bonds were utilized to allow orthogonal conjugation. The first PMO targets exon 23 of the dystrophin gene to correct the mdx genotype and the second to target removal of exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene so as to produce an internally deleted protein that lacks the crucial trans-membrane domains. Several different bi-specific conjugate designs were investigated whereby two PMOs were joined either at one end of the Pip6a peptide or with one PMO at either N-or C-termini. The activities of these conjugate constructs were assessed in mouse mdx cells and the most active bi-specific conjugates (D2 and D3), which had both PMOs attached at the C-terminus of the CPP, were shown to have closely comparable Dmd exon skipping activity to the single Pip6a-PMO targeting Dmd. D2 and D3 conjugates were also assessed in the same cells for targeting of Acvr2b and both conjugates demonstrated only very slightly reduced exon skipping activity compared to Pip6a-PMO targeting Acvr2b. Importantly, the cell viability using a bi-specific compound was significantly better than for a mixture of the two individual Pip6a-PMOs. We furthermore assessed the potential of this approach in an in vivo environment through intramuscular administration and demon-Nucleic Acids Research, 2015, Vol. 43, No. 1 31 strated that there were no significant differences in exon skipping activities for both Dmd and Acvr2b targets between bi-specific conjugates (D2 and D3) and a cocktail of the individual P-PMO equivalents.",

In the case of click chemistry conjugation to PMO, Pip6a was synthesized with an alkyne group either at its N-terminus for D1, or at its C-terminus for D2 and D3 (Figure 2A ). In D1, PMO (Dmd) was conjugated to the C-terminus through an amide bond and the 3 -azido-PMO (Acvr2b) was conjugated at the N-terminus through a triazole bond. For bi-specific conjugate D2, the Acvr2b PMO was click conjugated, whereas in conjugate D3 the Dmd targeting PMO was click conjugated. For click conjugations at the C-terminus of Pip6a, one \u2424-alanine (B) and one aminohexanoic acid (X) spacer residue were incorporated on ei-ther side of the Bpg alkyne derivative, whereas no spacer was used for N-terminal click conjugations (Figure 2A ). Bispecific conjugate D4 was prepared with a similar spacing to D3, but where a disulfide bond replaced the triazole bond through synthesis of Pip6a having a C-terminal X-Cys-B extension ( Figure 2B ). The assembly of these bi-specific conjugates required synthesis of three different derivatives of Pip6a, which were synthesized on solid phase using Fmoc peptide chemistry and purified by RP-HPLC to >95% purity in yields of 50-60%.",

The bi-specific conjugates D2 and D3, where both PMOs are conjugated to the C-terminus of Pip6a, exhibited better exon-skipping activity than for D1 and D4.

We chose for these initial studies simultaneous targeting of exon 23 of the Dmd gene and exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene, using a single CPP as PMO delivery agent and to observe whether exon skipping could be maintained for both targets. Dumonceaux et al. showed that a combination of restoration of dystrophin and simultaneously inhibition of the myostatinsignalling pathway results in a significant improvement in muscle growth and force in dystrophic mdx mice (25) . In a similar study, myostatin knockdown in conjunction with dystrophin restoration using an exon-skipping approach using a cocktail of two separate Pip6a-PMOs resulted in significantly increased mouse muscle mass (32) . Thus targeting two genes in this way might be expected to have clinical relevance.",

The first conjugation of PMO to Pip6a was carried out in all cases through formation of a stable amide bond between the 3 -secondary amine of the PMO to the C-terminal carboxyl group of a synthetic Pip6a derivative. The second PMO conjugation was then effected either using an alkyne group on the Pip6a to an azide-functionalized PMO to give a stable triazole linkage or with a Cys residue on the Pip6a to an activated thiol group on the PMO to form a reversible disulfide linkage (Figures 1 and 2) . Bi-specific conjugate D1 has one PMO at each Pip6a terminus whilst D2 and D3 have both PMOs at the C-terminus of Pip6a. The more sluggish click conjugation of the second PMO to the C-terminus of Pip6a in D2 and D3 at room temperature was presumably due to poorer accessibility than in the case of D1, but heating to 40 \u2022 C readily facilitated triazole bond formation (Figure 3) . Conjugation of the second PMO using a disulfide bond (D4) did not require heating.",

By contrast, when both PMOs were placed at the C-terminus of the Pip6a (D2 and D3), the Dmd skipping activity was restored to close to the level observed with Pip6a-PMO (Dmd) ( Figure 4A ), which confirms that CPP delivery is optimal when the CPP N-terminus is not blocked by a bulky substituent. Both conjugates D2 and D3 also demonstrated high levels of Acvr2b exon skipping in cells and close to that of the single Pip6a-PMO (Acvr2b) ( Figure 4B ). Further, both D2 and D3 conjugates showed exon skipping of both the Dmd and Acvr2b targets by intramuscular delivery ( Figure 5 ) at levels unaltered from that of individual Pip6a-PMOs. These results show conclusively that there is no sequestration of one PMO at its own target that prevents the action of the other PMO at its own target. Thus, there must be a sufficient on-off equilibrium established for each target release and for target accessibility. This is an important finding that validates the use of bi-specific P-PMO.",

One explanation for this could be due to partial reduction of the disulfide bond upon cell entry and liberation of free Dmd PMO from the bi-specific conjugate before the Pip6a can deliver it into the cell nucleus. However, note that no difference was found in splicing redirection in a HeLa705 cell model using either disulfide-linked or stably linked R 6 -Penetratin PNA (46) . By contrast in a recent study, bi-specific 2 -O-methyl phosphorothioate SSOs targeting both the Mstn and Dmd genes and delivered using a cationic transfection reagent were more effective when linked through a cleavable disulfide linker than through a non-cleavable hydrocarbon linker (33) . The differential effect of use of a cleavable disulfide linkage probably reflects a different cell and nuclear uptake mechanism for SSOs delivered by a transfection agent compared to covalent CPP delivery of uncharged PMO or PNA. Detailed mechanistic studies would be needed to confirm this, but it should be noted that uptake of Pip6a-PMO (Dmd) into mdx skeletal muscle cells has been shown recently to be predominantly caveolae-mediated, whereas in cardiomyocytes uptake was mostly clathrin-mediated (47) , suggesting that uptake routes are also cell dependent in addition to being dependent on oligonucleotide type and delivery method.",

PMO (Acvr2b) will therefore need further optimization to improve efficiency on this target. Alternatively, one might prefer to use a combination of PMO (Dmd) and a PMO that targets myostatin directly (32) to make a bi-specific PMO rather than targeting its receptor, and thus this second PMO needs to be optimized before embarking on lengthy intravenous delivery studies in mdx mice where larger scale synthesis would be needed. Clearly such studies need to investigate physiology benefits in addition to exon skipping (32) . However, the increase in cell viability in human hepatocyte cultures for bi-specific conjugate D2 compared to the same PMO concentration for a mixture of two Pip6a-PMOs ( Figure 6 ) is encouraging and if this lower toxicity is maintained in systemic delivery, the clinical importance could be significant when considering multiple targeting (whether targeting different exons in the same gene or in two different genes).",
