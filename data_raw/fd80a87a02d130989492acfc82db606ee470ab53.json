It has been reported that sfRNA results from stalling of host 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 at the highly structured RNA of the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Although XRN1 digestion of a 3'-terminal 800-nt RNA could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA in vitro, we found that knocking out XRN1 had no effect on the accumulation of sfRNA in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the stemloop II (SLII) at the 3' UTR is required for the accumulation of sfRNA. According to the results of an in vitro RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay, the (-)10431-10566 RNA fragment, containing the putative promoter on the antigenome for the sfRNA transcription, binds to RdRp protein and exhibits a strong promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the JEV sfRNA could be transcribed initially and then be trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases.",

            "text": "During virus infection, all arthropod-flaviviruses generate abundant amounts of a noncoding subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) representing the 3'-terminal highly conserved region of the 3' UTR [6] [7] [8] [9] . The sfRNA engages in multiple functions in order to control viral replication and antagonize host antiviral responses [4, 10, 11] . These functions include (i) the involvement of cytopathicity and pathogenicity in mammals [8] ; (ii) the down-regulation of PLOS antigenome synthesis and translation [12] ; (iii) the dysregulation of host mRNA stability [13, 14] ; (iv) the antagonizing of host innate immune response [15] [16] [17] ; (v) the suppression of RNA silencing [18, 19] ; (vi) the induction of apoptosis through the Bcl-2-mediated PI3k/Akt signaling pathway [20] ; and (vii) the determination of infection and transmission rates of West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV) in mosquitoes [21, 22] . How the sfRNA is made in the infected cells is intriguing. Several studies have shown that the sfRNA is a product of the incomplete degradation of the viral genome by cellular 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease XRN1; a pseudoknot or a three-helix junction structure in the 3' UTR is responsible for stalling XRN1 degradation [8, [23] [24] [25] [26] . This cleavage happened within a few minutes when carried out in vitro, and there were no intermediate byproducts during the exoribonuclease degradation process of the viral genome to the sfRNA in the virus-infected cells, which indicated that the degradation process is extremely efficient or that another biogenesis mechanism might be involved. The reason for these findings is not clear because degradation from the full-length genome seems uneconomic for viruses from an evolutionary point of view. Furthermore, being infected with RNA viruses induces double membrane vesicles to form replication/transcription complexes that are protease-and nuclease-resistant [27] [28] [29] .",

Knocking-down (KD) the XRN1 expression by up to 95% in HEK293T cells continued to increase the abundance of sfRNA throughout the 48-h infection period. More sfRNA (121%) was observed in XRN1 knocked-down cells than in the wild-type (WT) cells ( Fig 1A) . It should be noted that there were no decay intermediates between viral genome and the sfRNA even in the XRN1-deficient cells. Similar results were also observed in A549 cells infected with JEV (Fig 1B) , whereas DENV infection caused a slight reduction of sfRNA accumulation in the XRN1-KD cells (Fig 1C) . Statistical analysis of JEV sfRNA accumulation in XRN1-KD cells among three independent experiments showed about 112.5% \u00b1 8.5% at 48 h post infection. No statistically significant differences in the amount of the sfRNA were detected in the infected cells at any time in relation to the depletion of XRN1. These results indicated that either the exoribonuclease XRN1 in JEV-infected cells could be extremely active, such that the residual XRN1 (4-5%) might be sufficient to digest the JEV genome or that another nuclease or mechanism might be involved in the formation of sfRNA. To rule out the possibility that the residual XRN1 may contribute to the formation of sfRNA, we performed the experiments using XRN1 knock-out (KO) cells. As shown in Fig 1D, sfRNA accumulated abundantly in XRN1-KO cells infected with either JEV or DENV indicating that XRN1 does not play a direct role for the formation of sfRNA in vivo.",

To investigate the structure requirements for the production of JEV sfRNA in vivo, we performed mutagenesis studies in the context of a JEV infectious clone (in the S1 Text and S1 Table) . The structure of the JEV 3' UTR is diagramed in Fig 2A. Although equal amounts of cDNA (250 ng) for all mutants were transfected into BHK-21 cells, according to immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Northern hybridization results at 5 days post-transfection (dpt), the replication efficiency of the cDNA from different mutants varied (data not shown). These results suggest that the mutations made in these regions delayed the completion of the viral life cycle. We therefore collected the supernatant and measured the virus titers at the time when the cells showed strong CPE that varied from 4 to 11 dpt for different mutants (Table 1) . We then used equal amounts of MOI at 0.1 for each recombinant virus to infect BHK-21 cells and analyzed the RNA synthesis at 48 h post-infection (hpi). A deletion that spanned nt 10423-10729 (\u0394307) abolished the viral replication (Fig 2C, lane 3) , while the deletion of the AU-rich region (\u0394AU-rich) or the 5'-stemloop (\u03945'-SL) slightly delayed viral replication but had no lasting effect on the viral replication overall or on the sfRNA accumulation (Fig 2C, lanes 4-5 and Table 1 ).",

Beside the canonical 3'-cyclization (3'CYC) motif (CAGCAUAUUGA) at 10863-10873 that is complementary to 5'CS (UCAAUAUGCUG) at nt 136-146, we found another motif located at the initiation site of JEV sfRNA that is very similar to the 3'CYC motif (named CYC-like motif), the sequence of which is CAUGCAUAUGGA, where the mismatches with the 3'CYC motif are underlined). However, deletion of the CYC-like motif had no effect on the synthesis of the sfRNA and the genome (Fig 2C, lane 6) , whereas deletion of the entire SLII abolished the production of sfRNA (Fig 2C, lane 7) . Meanwhile, deletion of the lower left stemloop of the SLII (\u0394SLII.1), the upper stemloop (\u0394SLII.2) or the lower left stem (\u0394SLII.3) all impaired sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lanes 8-10) , indicating that the SLII structure is essential for sfRNA accumulation. Three point mutations disrupted base pairing of the first pseudoknot at the 3' UTR (PK1' or PK1\") prevented sfRNA formation (Fig 2C, lanes 11-12) , while compensatory changes restoring the PK pairing (PK1'1\") recovered the sfRNA synthesis ( Fig 2C, lane 13) suggesting that pseudoknot structure is also required for the sfRNA formation. To further demonstrate that the production of sfRNA requires the PK structure but does not rely on the activity of exoribonuclease XRN1, PK1'1\" and PK1\" mutants were used to infect WT or XRN1-KD HEK293T cells, and then the resulting effects were compared. Disruption of the PK structure (PK1\") abolished the sfRNA production in WT as well as in XRN1-KD cells, while compensatory changes that maintained the PK structure (PK1'1\") made no difference in the production of sfRNA in XRN1-KD cells or in WT cells (Fig 2D) , indicating that the requirement of the PK structure for the production of sfRNA does not rely on the activity of exoribonuclease XRN1.",

To test whether viral RdRp binds to the putative promoter and initiates sfRNA synthesis, we cloned the cDNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide at position 10431-10566 of the genome, and performed EMSA experiments using the minus-strand RNA as the riboprobe. Purified RdRp protein (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 \u03bcM) retarded the migration of the (-)10431-10566 RNA in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no band shift was observed with non-specific RNA or BSA control (Fig 4A) . It should be noted that the additional band above the RNA/protein complex (RPC) (Fig 4A, lanes 1-3) is inversely correlated to the occurring of RPC suggesting that the highly ordered RNA secondary structure may have intermolecular interactions when separated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This band is an indirect evidence of RdRp binding at this region. The intermolecular interactions were disrupted with increasing amounts of RdRp (Fig 4A, left panel) . In contrast, the band remained the same when incubated with increasing amounts of BSA control (Fig 4A, right panel) . Competition assays were performed to test the specificity of the interaction between the RdRp and the (-) 10431-10566 RNA. Increasing amounts of unlabeled RNA out competed the RPC (Fig 4B,  lanes 3-5) . In contrast, neither tRNA (lanes 6-8) nor nonspecific RNA (lanes 9-11) competed away the RPC.

The result showed that the (+)1-160 RNA is a functional template for RNA synthesis whereas the 5' 226-nt RNA from bovine coronavirus (as a nonspecific template control) could not direct RNA synthesis, nor the reaction without adding the RdRp (Fig 4C) , indicating that the purified recombinant JEV RdRp has specific enzymatic activity.

Two major synthetic products were detected, the larger band with 136 nt in length same as the size marker driven by T7 RNA polymerase, and the smaller band with 113 nts in length presumably a transcription product initiated from the putative promoter (Fig 4D, lane 7) . We then constructed various templates for in vitro RdRp assays (Fig 4E and 4F and S1 Table) .

The crystal structure of the xrRNAs in the 3' UTR that resist the degradation process has been determined [7, 23] , and the function of the stalling has been studied in several flaviviruses [26, [36] [37] [38] . Although stalling of XRN1 by the JEV sfRNA has been reported previously [14] , detailed mechanism of the sfRNA formation has not yet been elucidated. The results of this study showed that either knocking down or knocking out of XRN1 gave rise to more sfRNA accumulation in virusinfected cells (Fig 1A, 1B and 1D ). It has also been reported that XRN1 could be redundant with other exonucleases in producing Zika virus sfRNAs [7] . These controversial results may be explained by several reasons including (i) exonucleases other than XRN1 can contribute to sfRNA formation, (ii) depletion of XRN1 causes changes in total cellular RNA level that may include products of endonucleolytic cleavage, and (iii) reduction in XRN1 may contribute to differences in susceptibility to viral infection [7] . Although we cannot vehemently rule out these possibilities, theoretically, exoribonuclease XRN1 depletion should reduce the production of the sfRNA, resulting in a reduction of the molar ratio of the sfRNA to the genome, yet an increase rather than a decrease in molar ratio was observed. Furthermore, no intermediate degradation byproducts from viral genome to the sfRNA were detected during infection even in the XRN1-deficient cells (Fig 1A-1D) . Morevoer, several unsolved mysteries including the unreasonably high rate of nonsense-mediated decay to generate the sfRNA, the question of how the viral genome within the membrane-protected complex is subjected to RNA degradation, and the lack of economy in degradation from the full-length genome from an evolutionary point of view, led us to reconsider other possible mechanisms of the JEV sfRNA formation.",

By transfecting replicon constructs containing various deletions Pijlman et al. demonstrated that sfRNA does not require viral RNA replication, viral proteins, or 5' UTR since all deletion mutants showed similar levels of sfRNA accumulation [8] . The sfRNA was also detected in BHK-21 cells electroporated with nonreplicating replicon DENV-2 containing the catalytic GDD motif of the NS5 replaced with AAA [20] . The initial RNA transcripts either from replicon or infectious clone are all driven by CMV promoter. If formation of the JEV sfRNA were not required for RNA replication, the accumulation of sfRNA could be detected in the GDD-mutant infected cells. Although efficient RNA replication is required for the detection of any flaviviral RNAs no matter the sfRNA is made either by degradation or by transcription, our results are clearly different from those of previous studies of the WNV and DENV. Although the WNV and JEV belong to the same serotype, different viruses may have evolved to have different strategies for survival in infected cells.",

We attempted to clarify the initiation site of the RdRp products by applying 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) assays but failed to observe any specific sequences due to low amount of the radiolabeled products. Efforts had also been made to demonstrate that the putative promoter is functional in infected cells by transfecting RNA construct containing unrelated sequences under the control of the promoter. Unfortunately, our numerous attempts to make such a construct failed probably because the transfected molecule may not be accessible as a template to the viral RdRp at the right place and right time. It has been shown that the recombinant JEV NS5 exhibited a weak terminal transferase activity only when substrate ribonucleotides were limited [39] . Sufficient amounts of ribonucleotides were supplied in the in vitro RdRp assay (Fig 4C and 4D) , thus the products are least likely resulting from the terminal transferase activity. Furthermore, in vitro digestion of the 3' UTR containing fragment (a 800-nt RNA) by XRN1 revealed that XRN1 could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA (Fig 1E) . These results let us to propose the model that the JEV sfRNA is likely made by transcription initially and then could be further trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases (Fig 5) .",

It has been shown in previous studies with WNV that the deletion of the 5' half of the 3' UTR does not affect the genome replication but does halt the sfRNA formation [8] . However, a similar deletion at the 3' UTR of JEV (\u0394307) totally killed virus replication ( Fig  2C, lane 3) . Whether a partial deletion of the dumbbell structure resulted in the lethal phenotype remains to be determined. It has been suggested that the subgenomic RNA promoter sequences often form a stem-loop structure, which is proposed to facilitate the interaction with the transcriptase as well as other host factors [40] . We found that deletion of the entire or any part of the SLII all impaired sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lanes 7-10) , indicating that the SLII structure is essential for sfRNA accumulation and could be a potential promoter for the sfRNA synthesis. Furthermore, pseudoknot structure on SLII is required for the formation of sfRNA in WNV, yellow fever virus (YFV), and ZIKV [7, 24, 25] . Our result also showed that pseudoknot structure is essential for the formation of sfRNA in JEV (Fig 2C, lanes 11-13) . Interestingly, mutations made at the SLII region showed relatively smaller plaques and delayed viral maturation or release (Fig 2E and 2F ). This observation may correlate with the report that sfRNA-deficient WNV displays significantly decreased infection and transmission rates in mosquitoes [21] .",

In this study, we identified the SLII that showed promoter activity as good as the SLA promoter (Figs 2 and 4) . We also found that the initiation site of JEV sfRNA located at a 3'-cyclization-like motif. This CYC-like motif complementary to the 5' cyclization sequences may be involved in genome cyclization during antigenome synthesis and may cause template switching to occur, as reported by Maeda et al. [45] . However, deletion of the CYC-like motif had no effect on sfRNA accumulation in vivo (Fig 2C, lane 6) . A potential role of this CYC-like motif remains to be studied.",

The Rel. % value represents the percentage of XRN1 expression in cells transfected with shXRN1 compared to wild-type cells (WT)(100%) as shown at the top (A-C). The XRN1-KD HEK293T (A) or A549 (B) cells were infected with JEV.

(C) XRN1-KD HEK293T cells were infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 5 as a control. Total RNAs were extracted at 72 h postinfection and Northern blots were analyzed using a DIG-labeled riboprobe detecting nt 10270 to nt 10723 in the 3'UTR.

RNA isolated from these cells at 48 h post-infection was subjected to Northern blot analysis. (E) RNA degradation analysis of non-replicative 800-nt 3'-terminal monophosphate transcripts derived from genome of JEV or DENV as indicated was measured in vitro by incubating with the indicated amounts of XRN1. Total RNAs extracted from JEV or DENV-2 infected cells (1 \u03bcg) were used as the sfRNA size marker (lanes 5 and 10).

(A) EMSA showing the interaction between the (-)10431-10566 RNA with the purified recombinant RdRp protein. Uniformly DIG-labeled (-)10431-10566 RNA (0.25 pmol) or nonspecific RNA (nsRNA) from 5' 152-nt of bovine coronavirus genome were titrated with increasing concentrations of RdRp (or BSA) from 0.25, 0.5, 1 to 2.5 \u03bcM. The complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. Position of the free probe and RNA-protein complexes (RPC) are indicated. (B) Specific interaction of RdRp with the (-)10431-10566 RNA. All reactions contained the same amount of DIG-labeled (-)10431-10566 RNA (0.25 pmol). (Lane 1) free probe; (lanes 2-11) 2.5 \u03bcM of RdRp were used; (lane 2) no competitor; (lanes 3-11) unlabeled RNA competitors, representing either (-)10431-10566, tRNA, or nsRNA (10-, 50-, 100-fold molar excess) as indicated, were added to the gel-shift assay to compete against complex formation. The complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. (C) Template specificity of the purified RdRp. Templates tested were nsRNA and (+)1-160 RNA (the SLA-containing promoter element) as indicated on the top. (D) Transcripts driven by T7 RNA polymerase used as size markers (lanes 1-5) or RNA templates used for in vitro RdRp assays (lanes 6-10) are shown on the top. The products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 6M urea. (E) Schematic diagram of the minus RNA fragments used as templates for the in vitro RdRp assays. The numbers correspond to the nucleotide positions in the JEV genome. The products are depicted as de novo synthesis or transcription products with size (nts) indicated.
