In 2012, the medical humanitarian organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) decided to adopt a data sharing policy for routinely collected clinical and research data (http://www. msf.org.uk/msf-data-sharing). Here we describe the policy's principles, practicalities, and development process. We hope this paper will encourage and help other humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations to share their data with public health researchers for the benefit of the populations with which they work.",

Sensitive data are defined as any subset of information that can be misused against the interests of the individuals whose data are included in the dataset or against MSF, or that put either individuals or MSF at risk for political, financial, or other reasons (Box 3).
