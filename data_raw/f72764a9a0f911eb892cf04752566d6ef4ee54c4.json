            "text": "The envelope of HSV-1 contains a number of glycoproteins, four of which are essential for virus entry. Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-kB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-kB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-kB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.",

One such viral strategy involves hijacking signalling pathways that ultimately control host gene transcription. Interactions between intracellular viral proteins and cellular kinases responsible for signal transduction are a means by which to achieve this. However, there is growing evidence to support the premise that glycoproteins on the surface of virus particles may trigger intracellular signalling pathways by interacting with their cognate receptors on the host cell membrane [1] .",

The initial phase is transient, lasting only two hours, and occurred shortly after viral adsorption by both wild-type and UV-inactivated virus particles. This correlates with evidence showing that supernatant taken from gD-expressing cells may also cause an increase in NF-KB binding activity in monocytoid cells by 30 minutes post-treatment [6] . A second phase relied on de novo viral protein synthesis as it was stimulated only by replication-competent HSV-1 and not by UV-inactivated virions [8] .

Suppression of NF-kB activity is via negative feedback up-regulation of the inhibitor IkBa (nfkbia), which was also stimulated by the binding of entry-defective HSV-1 virions. The triggering of early NF-kB transcriptional activity was most likely through the coupling of gD on entry-defective virions to the TNF superfamily receptor HvEM [1] . In doing so, not only does the initial activation of this pathway allow for the subsequent sequestration of the NF-kB p65 subunit to the ICP0 promoter, but is crucial for immediate-early gene transcription and subsequent HSV-1 replication [8] . Intracellular signalling induced by soluble gD can protect against Fas-mediated apoptosis with inhibition of NF-kB signalling leading to a loss of this protection [6] . Infection with UV-inactivated virions also led to an increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein c-IAP2 (birc3), which we have demonstrated to be up-regulated after inoculation with entry-defective virions containing gD. Additional studies have supported the anti-apoptotic role for NF-kB during HSV-1 infection yet there are conflicting data that demonstrate possible pro-apoptotic activity [34] [35] . This inconsistency may be due to differing cell types used in those studies. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts have been shown to be resistant to apoptosis after infection with recombinant HSV-1 that is unable to express ICP4 or ICP27 whereas infection with either virus has been shown to cause apoptosis in transformed cell lines [36] .",

Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl are found in the outer mitochondrial membrane and are thought to suppress apoptosis by blocking mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilisation through the sequestration of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members [38] . Given the up-regulation of four anti-apoptotic genes, birc2, birc3, bcl2 and bcl2l1, through the activation of multiple signalling pathways by entry-defective HSV-1, this establishes a role for gD binding in shifting the intracellular environment towards a more anti-apoptotic stance. .

Glycoprotein D acts as the main signalling molecule on the surface of the HSV-1 envelope. gH interacts with a v b 3 integrins to potentially trigger the production of IFN-b, which is known to involve IRF-3 and 7 [48] . Binding by gD to HvEM may lead to the activation of TRAF molecules, which in turn stimulate the NF-kB signaling cascade. This pathway up-regulates a number of cellular genes in addition to augmenting early viral gene expression. NF-kBresponsive genes, birc2 and birc3, have an anti-apoptotic role, but paradoxically, inflammatory mediators such as ccl2 are also up-regulated. gDinduced signalling of the Jak/Stat and Jak/Src pathways also results in the differential expression of genes associated with anti-apoptosis and inflammation. The up-regulation of c-Myc could lead to a corresponding increase in cdk2, which has a role in promoting DNA replication and gene transcription during infection. It should be noted that most signalling cascades have been elucidated in non-fibroblast cells lines, so the role of specific kinases may vary in HFFs. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009560.g003",

Nevertheless, productive infection with HSV-1 can down-regulate the triggered ISG response, allowing viral replication to continue unhindered [40] . Despite our evidence that gD binding by entry-defective virions can induce IFN-a mRNA expression, independent of gD glycosylation status, these data also fit with published observations that binding by HSV-1 is insufficient to cause the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes [30] . The up-regulation of IFN-b, albeit it through a different mechanism, is suggestive of a previously unidentified role for gH in eliciting a change in host gene expression. An entry-defective HSV-1 mutant lacking gB that also contains an RGE rather than the integrin binding RGD motif of gH has been constructed and future studies may further elicit the role of gH in interferon stimulation.",

Its up-regulation is rapidly induced after mitogenic stimulation or the introduction of serum and increased expression of c-Myc is consistent with the advancement of cellular proliferation [41] . Control of myc transcription can be influenced by a number of pathways, including PI3K/Akt signalling, which was shown here to occur as a result of binding by gD. A central role for c-Myc in promoting cell-cycle progression is evident from the genes that it can up-regulate such as eIF2 [42] . Progression of the cell cycle depends on the additional activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. By interacting with the promoters for genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, c-Myc can influence the advancement on the cell cycle into the G1/S phase [43] .",

Cells were then mock-infected or inoculated with 1000 particles/cell of entry-defective DgH HSV-1 then lysed at the indicated times and assayed for luciferase activity. Error bars are the +/2 standard error across triplicate luciferase assays for each biological duplicate. (B) NF-kB, JAK/STAT, JAK/Src and PI3K/Akt-responsive genes that were previously shown to be differentially expressed at 6 hours post-inoculation with DgB and DgH virions were examined for changes in expression at two-and-a-half hours after inoculation with 1000 particles/cell of DgH virions. The induction of JAK/STAT and PI3K/ Akt targets is not significantly up-regulated above the two-fold threshold by two-and-a-half hours post-inoculation. A number of NF-kB-associated transcripts are significantly up-regulated, with ccl2 showing a far greater induction at two-and-a-half hours than six hours. Both JAK/Src targets, bcl2 and bcl2l1 are induced to similar levels found at six hours post-inoculation.

Glycoprotein D acts as the main signalling molecule on the surface of the HSV-1 envelope. gH interacts with a v b 3 integrins to potentially trigger the production of IFN-b, which is known to involve IRF-3 and 7 [48]. Binding by gD to HvEM may lead to the activation of TRAF molecules, which in turn stimulate the NF-kB signaling cascade. This pathway up-regulates a number of cellular genes in addition to augmenting early viral gene expression. NF-kBresponsive genes, birc2 and birc3, have an anti-apoptotic role, but paradoxically, inflammatory mediators such as ccl2 are also up-regulated. gDinduced signalling of the Jak/Stat and Jak/Src pathways also results in the differential expression of genes associated with anti-apoptosis and inflammation. The up-regulation of c-Myc could lead to a corresponding increase in cdk2, which has a role in promoting DNA replication and gene transcription during infection. It should be noted that most signalling cascades have been elucidated in non-fibroblast cells lines, so the role of specific kinases may vary in HFFs. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009560.g003",

HFFs were stimulated with 1000 particles/cell of entry-defective HSV-1 and changes in cellular gene expression were detected by real-time PCR at 6 hours postinoculation. NF-kB responsive genes appear to be up-regulated by binding of either DgB or DgH virions to the cell. The increase in NF-kB-associated transcripts appears specific as not all targets were differentially regulated. A similar pattern of gene expression is seen for Jak/Stat pathway targets in that DgD virions appear to be unable to stimulate signalling whereas DgB and DgH binding can. MMP7 is only associated with the PI3 Kinase/Akt pathway and coupled with the up-regulation of BCL2, CCND1 and MYC, it would appear that binding may be sufficient to also stimulate this pathway, although not by virions lacking in gD. The Jak/Src pathway only contains two targets on the signalling specific microarray, one of which, BCL2, was associated with other pathways. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009560.t002",
