On the other hand, large insertions or deletions have been found in the part of viral genome that encodes the SARS-CoV accessory proteins which have no viral homologues. The ORF 8a/8b region appears to be particularly prone to mutations as deletions of up to 415 bp have been observed in some isolates [2] . Although these mutations do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that these mutations may have effects on viral pathogenesis in vivo, as have been observed for other coronaviruses [5] .",

According to several analyses of about 100 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV isolates (in total) obtained from human and animal populations and that have been deposited with Genbank, there has been no report of mutations in this region [1] [2] [3] [4] ]. It is possible that direct sequencing results do not show this mutation if it is present in only a minority population. There was a previous report on a frameshift mutation in the 3a gene but the identity of this isolate was not mentioned [7] . The 3a gene from culture-derived SARS-CoV isolates contained heterogeneous extensions at this internal oligo(T) tract. The nature of this extension was such that up to three additional T's were added to the 6T's tract. Any change in the number of T's in this oligo(T) tract, other than in multiples of three, would result in a frameshift mutation and premature translation termination of 3a.",

As our polymerase fidelity controls have confirmed that it is highly unlikely that sequencing and PCR errors are the source of these nucleotide aberrations (data not shown), and these results showed that different variants of the 3a gene exist in the viruses that were replicating in these patients. The percentage of the different mutant transcripts varied considerably from patient to patient. However, in 6 out of the 8 patients, more than 50 % of the sgRNA3 transcripts contains either 6T's or 9T's, which means that the full-length 3a (or with 1 additional amino acid) will be expressed. In patient D, less than 10 % of the transcripts are in-frame, while in patient E, none of the transcripts is in-frame, indicating that the full-length 3a protein will be expressed at a low level (Pat D) or not expressed at all (Pat E). In comparison, about 27 % of the transcripts from a culturederived virus are in-frame [6] . Overall, these results showed that the frameshift mutations of the 3a gene are not specific to culture-derived SARS-CoV and that they point towards the existence of quasispecies within a given population of SARS-CoVs. As deduced from their study of sequence variation of the spike gene from viral isolates, another group has also suggested that SARS-CoV quasispecies exists in vivo [8] .",

We have shown that at least one of these truncated forms of 3a, named as 3amut1, can be detected in the lysate of infected cells [6] . It has been shown that the 3a is localized to the cell surface of SARS-CoV infected cells [6, 9] . FACS analysis showed that while the myc-3a protein (full-length 3a with a c-myc epitope at the N-terminus) was transported to the cell surface in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells, the myc-3amut1 (truncated 3a with the same c-myc epitope) could not be detected on cell surface (Figure 2A ). Western blot analysis was also performed to ensure that the expressions of the full-length and truncated 3a proteins in the transfected cells were comparable ( Figure 2B ). As 3amut1 corresponds to 101 to 274 amino acids of 3a and lacks the first two transmembrane domains [6] , our results showed that these two transmembrane domains are essential for the expression of 3a on the cell surface.",

The insertion of a single adenylate nucleotide into this region of 3b resulted in a C-terminally truncated gene product. The corresponding mutant 3b was also localized differently within the cell. In view of the fact that 3a has also been shown to interact with the spike protein [6, 7] and that both proteins have a tendency to co-mutate [7] , it would be interesting to know whether these serial frameshift mutations can also be correlated with a recognizable mutation pattern of the spike gene.",

FMDV populations with longer poly(A) extensions seem to have a lower fitness value as compared to those Distribution of 3a sequence variants within a population of SARS-CoV obtained from clinical and culture-derived samples with shorter extensions [11] . This is despite the fact that both the wild-type and mutant forms of the affected FMDV protein, the L protease, have equal functionality [13] .

Our results showed that the viruses in some of the patients appear to encode only for the truncated form(s) of 3a and not the full-length 3a protein ( Figure 1 ) and indicated that the functionality of full-length 3a is not essential for virus replication. However, it is also conceivable that the different variants of 3a have different stabilities and/or functions, and hence would contribute differently to viral pathogenesis in vivo. In addition, it was recently reported that 3a is a structural protein and at least 2 truncated forms of 3a were dominantly present in the virion [9] . Further studies will reveal if the truncated forms of 3a, which results from frameshift mutations in the viral genome, can be incorporated in the virion and if there are phenotypic effects of a truncated 3a during the infection cycle. With respect to viral viability in the natural host, does full-length 3a confer a fitness gain over truncated 3a? If so, the possibility remains that under selective pressure, the distribution of viral genotypes could tip in favor to those which carry the wild-type 3a gene. A similar genotypic reversion event has been documented for FMDV [11] . Further studies on a larger cohort of patients will be necessary to establish if there is a relationship between the mutations observed in the 3a transcripts and the severity of the clinical symptoms in individual patients.",
