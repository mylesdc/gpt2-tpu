We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication. Here we have investigated the effect of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on the formation of arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our approach involved ectopic expression of arterivirus nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp3, which induce DMV formation in the absence of other viral triggers of the interferon response, such as replicating viral RNA. Thus, this setup can be used to identify immune effectors that specifically target the (formation of) virus-induced membrane structures. Using large-scale electron microscopy mosaic maps, we found that IFN-\u2424 treatment significantly reduced the formation of the membrane structures. Strikingly, we also observed abundant stretches of double-membrane sheets (a proposed intermediate of DMV formation) in IFN-\u2424-treated samples, suggesting the disruption of DMV biogenesis. Three interferon-stimulated gene products, two of which have been reported to target the hepatitis C virus replication structures, were tested for their possible involvement, but none of them affected membrane structure formation. Our study reveals the existence of a previously unknown innate immune mechanism that antagonizes the viral hijacking of host membranes.",

It is unknown whether the cellular innate immune system can detect and/or inhibit the formation of these membrane structures, which could be an effective mechanism to delay viral RNA replication. In this study, using an expression system that closely mimics the formation of arterivirus replication structures, we show for the first time that IFN-\u2424 treatment clearly reduces the amount of induced membrane structures. Moreover, drastic morphological changes were observed among the remaining structures, suggesting that their biogenesis was impaired. Follow-up experiments suggested that host cells contain a hitherto unknown innate antiviral mechanism, which targets this common feature of positive-strand RNA virus replication. Our study provides a strong basis for further research into the interaction of the innate immune system with membranous viral replication organelles.",

For some of these doublemembrane vesicle (DMV)-forming viruses, connections between the DMV interior and the cytosol have been observed (14) (15) (16) . However, this was not the case for arteri-and coronaviruses, raising the question of whether their RNA synthesis takes place inside these vesicles, by analogy with the replication spherules described above. In that scenario, it would be unclear how newly synthesized RNA molecules are exported to the cytosol for translation and packaging (13, 17) .",

            "text": "Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the prototype of the arterivirus family and induces the formation of an extensive reticulovesicular network (RVN) of DMVs, which is thought to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (13) . Furthermore, EAV infection results in the formation of proteinaceous tubules containing the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which were found in close proximity to the DMVs and were suggested to be involved in nucleocapsid assembly (13, 19) . The EAV replicase gene encodes two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the second being a C-terminallyextended version of the first produced by ribosomal frameshifting. These precursors are cleaved by internal proteases to yield at least 13 mature viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) (reviewed in reference 20) . Previous studies from our laboratory provided the first detailed description of arterivirus-induced remodeling of host membranes and established that expression of the nsp2 to -7 part of the EAV replicase polyproteins suffices to induce the formation of DMVs strikingly similar to those formed in infected cells (21) . Subsequent studies demonstrated that the same result can be achieved by expressing a polyprotein fragment encompassing nsp2 and nsp3, including the papain-like protease in nsp2 (PLP2) that cleaves the nsp2-nsp3 junction (22, 23) . As for other positivestrand RNA viruses, the viral nonstructural proteins directly involved in RNA synthesis, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as well as the (presumed) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates of viral RNA replication, colocalize with the membrane structures induced during EAV infection (1, 13, 21) . When analyzed in more detail, however, the dsRNA was mainly located in the core of the DMVs, whereas the nonstructural proteins were located mainly on the membranes of the vesicles as well as on surrounding membranes (13, 21) , as was also observed for coronaviruses (17, 24) .",

One proposed mechanism for DMV biogenesis, termed \"double budding,\" includes the acquisition of the double membrane by the sequential budding of vesicles into and out of the ER lumen. Alternatively, ER membranes may pair to form double-membrane sheets, which would then bend and undergo fission to produce closed vesicles, a process termed \"enwrapping\" (1, 21, 23) . In a recent study, we detected intermediate structures compatible with both models. Putative intermediates consisting of double-membrane sheets that fitted different stages of enwrapping were, however, particularly prominent, suggesting that enwrapping could be a key biogenesis pathway for EAV-induced structures (23) . In the present study, we will refer to any combination of EAV nsp-induced membrane structures, including these intermediates, as \"double-membrane structures\" (DMS), irre-spective of whether they are formed in the context of viral infection or upon expression of viral proteins.",

            "text": "The exact benefits of positive-strand RNA viral replication organelle formation remain unclear, although several advantages have been proposed (1-3, 23, 25) . First, the replication organelles could constitute a suitable microenvironment for viral RNA synthesis by concentrating the necessary viral and host proteins. Second, they could play an important role in the spatiotemporal coordination of the different steps of the viral replication cycle, such as genome translation, replicase polyprotein processing, RNA synthesis, and virion assembly. The third proposed role is hiding viral RNA species from detection by innate immune sensors. These sensors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as virus-derived nucleic acids, leading to the induction of inflammatory responses and the production of type I interferons such as beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) (26) (27) (28) . These interferons then signal in autocrine and paracrine fashion to upregulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) inducing a so-called \"antiviral state\" that strongly restricts further spread of the infection (26) (27) (28) . The antiviral activities of several of the hundreds of ISGs induced upon type I interferon signaling have been characterized to a certain extent, and these impact diverse aspects of viral infection such as entry, genome replication, particle formation, or budding (29) . Even though virus-induced replication organelles are a prominent feature of positive-strand RNA viruses, there is very limited evidence for a direct targeting of these replication organelles by the innate immune system. To our knowledge, in fact only two reports have described such effects-in both cases on the membranous web formed during HCV replication (30, 31) ; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully characterized, and data for any other positive-strand RNA virus are lacking.",

Our goal was to analyze whether the innate immune system responds to the formation of positive-strand RNA virus-induced replication organelles, and we hypothesized that such a response could be linked to the type I IFN signaling pathway, which has an important role in counteracting virus infections from their earliest stage onwards. Human liver carcinoma cells (HuH-7), which are susceptible to EAV infection (Fig. 1A) (23) and produce high titers of infectious virus, were used based on their responsiveness to Oudshoorn et al. (Fig. 1B) (32) . When EAV-infected HuH-7 cells were fixed by high-pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution (HPF-FS) and subsequently analyzed by EM, DMSs similar to those previously described upon EAV infection in other cell types were readily observed ( Fig. 1C) (13, 23) . DMVs with characteristic double membranes and cores were abundantly present (Fig. 1C , red arrows) as well as the N protein-containing tubules described previously (13) (Fig. 1C , black arrows). In order to establish whether EAV replication is sensitive to IFN-\u2424 treatment in HuH-7 cells, cells were infected with a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing reporter virus (EAV-GFP [33] ; multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) and treated with IFN-\u2424 from 1 h postinfection (p.i.) onward. A clear dose-dependent reduction of the GFP signal was observed during a single cycle of infection (Fig. 1D) .",

Thus, to investigate innate immune responses specifically targeting DMS formation, the latter process needed to be mimicked in a system that does not depend on EAV replication. Previously, the coexpression of EAV nsp2 and nsp3 (as a self-cleaving nsp2-3 polyprotein fragment) has been shown to be both required and sufficient to induce DMV formation in transfected cells, and such a system can thus be used as a \"surrogate\" to mimic the formation of DMSs outside the context of infection (22) .",

Induction of nsp2-3 expression in this cell line resulted in the formation of uniform DMVs (Fig. 2B) , which appeared similar to those observed in HuH-7-infected cells, whereas such structures were not observed in noninduced cells. Although these DMVs were slightly larger than those found during EAV infection and (as expected) lacked the RNA-containing electron-dense core (compare Fig 1C and 2B) , electron tomography showed that their double-membrane architecture was identical ( Fig. 2B ). At 24 h post-tetracycline induction, many DMVs were found (Fig. 2B ). The presence of the C-terminal GFP tag on nsp3 did not influence the morphology of DMVs, as they were indistinguishable from those induced by expression of HA-nsp2-3 lacking the GFP tag (23) . The nsp2-3 expressed in HuH-7/tetR/ HA-nsp2-3GFP cells localized to the perinuclear region ( Fig. 2C) , which is very similar to their localization in EAV-infected cells (Fig. 1A) . While the expression levels of nsp2 were somewhat lower in the tetracycline-induced HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells compared to that in EAV-infected cells, the nsp2-3 polyprotein was correctly and efficiently cleaved by PLP2, as no precursor protein could be observed (Fig. 2D ). In conclusion, this cell line could be used to reproducibly and quantitatively examine the specific interactions of arterivirus-induced membrane structures with the cell's innate immune responses.",

We first checked whether the expression of nsp2-3GFP in HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells and the resulting DMV formation by itself induced an innate immune response, which would imply that the structures can be sensed by the innate immune system. In our setup, this was not the case since no IFN-\u2424 or IFIT2 mRNA could be detected after induction of nsp2-3GFP expression in HuH7 or mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (data not shown). We argued that in EAV-infected cells type I IFN induction might be triggered by other viral PAMPs (e.g., viral FIG 1 EAV infection in HuH-7 cells is productive and sensitive to IFN-\u2424 treatment. (A) HuH-7 cells infected with EAV were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for nsp2 (red) and nucleocapsid protein (N; green) at 12 hpi. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue). (B) Protein levels in HuH-7 cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting after 12 h of stimulation with 500 U/ml IFN-\u2424 or were analyzed in untreated control cells. (C) EAV-infected HuH-7 cells were high-pressure frozen at 12 hpi. Samples were freeze substituted and analyzed by electron tomography as previously described (23) . A virtual slice (2 nm thick) of a reconstructed tomogram is shown. The red arrows point at some of the multiple DMVs present in the field of view. The boxed DMV is enlarged in the inset to make the two tightly apposed DMV membranes more apparent. Black arrows indicate some of the N-containing tubules. The scale bar represents 200 nm. (D) HuH-7 cells were infected with EAV-GFP in 96-well black plates for 1 h, and after removal of the inoculum, they were treated with the indicated dose of IFN-\u2424. Cells were fixed at 16 hpi, and GFP fluorescence was measured and normalized to a control infection.

RNA), which could affect the formation or function of the replication organelles by inducing the expression of particular ISGs and thus augmenting the general antiviral effect of the innate immune response. In order to address this possibility, we initially asked the question of whether IFN-\u2424 treatment affects the number of EAV nsp2-3-induced DMS formed per cell. For this timeconsuming quantitative analysis, we decided to use chemically fixed samples, which simplified the workflow while providing sufficient preservation to clearly assess the general morphology of the DMSs induced upon nsp2-3 expression (see below). The HuH-7/ tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells were chemically fixed, scraped from the dish, pelleted, and embedded in an epoxy resin, after which thin sections suitable for transmission EM imaging were cut. By using cell pellets rather than monolayers, these sections represented random planes through the cells. We argued that if there would be a difference in the extent of DMS formation, this would be reflected in the number of cell profiles that contain DMSs, as the fraction of random sections containing structures would decrease. Importantly, we first checked the effect of IFN-\u2424 treatment on nsp2-3 expression levels and polyprotein cleavage in HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells, since altered expression of nsp2-3 would likely affect DMS formation and possibly mask specific effects of the IFN-\u2424 treatment. Cells were treated with tetracycline and/or IFN-\u2424 (Fig. 3A) , and nsp3GFP expression was measured by flow cytometry. GFP signal increased after tetracycline induction, as expected, but was not affected by IFN-\u2424 treatment at the concentration used in our experiments (Fig. 3B) . Likewise, polyprotein cleavage was not majorly affected since no HA-nsp2-3GFP precursor could be observed after IFN-\u2424 treatment, similar to the situation without IFN-\u2424 treatment (Fig. 3C) .",

Using large mosaic maps of EM micrographs (35), we quantified the number of cell profiles positive for DMSs as well as the total number of cell profiles showing a nucleus, which was used as a reference for normalizing the total number of cells analyzed (Fig. 3D) . In four independent experiments, sections containing 300 to 500 cell profiles with a nucleus were analyzed for each condition. This revealed a consistent decrease (27% \u03ee 7%) in the number of cell profiles positive for nsp2-3-induced DMSs after treatment with IFN-\u2424 (Fig. 3E ).

As mentioned previously, tetracycline-induced HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells mainly developed the DMV type of DMS (Fig. 4A ). In 1% of the DMS-containing cell profiles, we also observed some double-membrane sheets, a presumed precursor of DMVs during their biogenesis (Fig. 4A , bottom panel, red arrow) (21, 23) . These sheets were mostly found in the vicinity of DMVs and resembled the two tightly apposed membranes of the DMVs themselves, but they varied in shape, depending in part on the sectioning plane for EM. When the tetracycline-induced HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells were also treated with IFN-\u2424, double-membrane sheets were found in much larger fraction of the DMS-containing cell profiles (36% \u03ee 3%) ( Fig. 4B and C) . With a few exceptions, the doublemembrane sheets were found in cell profiles that also contained DMVs ( Fig. 4B and C) . They were often juxtaposed to intact DMVs and were usually strikingly more extensive than the double-membrane sheets observed without IFN-\u2424 treatment (compare Fig. 4A [bottom panel, red arrow] and B). This strong increase in double-membrane sheet formation suggested a major effect in DMS biogenesis after IFN-\u2424 treatment.",

The mRNAs of both viperin and PLSCR1 were strongly upregulated, whereas CH25H mRNA could not be detected, either with or without IFN-\u2424 treatment (Fig. 5A) .

We treated HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells with 10 M 25HC, a concentration that partially inhibited EAV replication in parental HuH-7 cells (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).

Our hypothesis was that-given their abundance in the cytosol of the infected cell-these structures are a likely target of the innate immune system. Disrupting the formation and/or function of virusinduced replication organelles would hamper viral replication and could therefore constitute an effective antiviral strategy for the cell. Our findings show that treatment of cells with IFN-\u2424 (mimicking the triggering of innate immunity after recognition of PAMPs such as viral nucleic acids) inhibits the formation of arterivirus-induced DMVs. We not only observed a decrease in the fraction of cells positive for EAV nsp2-3-induced DMS, but we also noticed the extensive accumulation of double-membrane sheets, which could be intermediates of DMV morphogenesis that become much more prevalent upon IFN-\u2424 treatment. This suggests that the membrane-curving and/or fission events that could lead to DMV formation after initial membrane pairing (23) were inhibited by IFN-\u2424 treatment (Fig. 6 ). This conclusion is further supported by a preliminary experiment (data not shown) in which expression of nsp2-3GFP was first induced for 24 h, to allow DMS formation, after which IFN-\u2424 treatment was performed for another 24 h. In the latter experiment, the effect of IFN-\u2424 treatment on double-membrane sheet formation was markedly decreased: only 19.9% of the DMS-containing cell profiles contained sheets instead of 34.4% in cells treated with IFN-\u2424 from the moment of induction of nsp2-3GFP expression. This renders the alternative scenario-IFN-\u2424 treatment disrupting existing DMVs and converting them into double-membrane sheets-less likely and strongly suggests that IFN-\u2424 treatment indeed influences DMV biogenesis, although we cannot exclude some effects on existing structures. Our data may also shed more light on DMV morphogenesis, since they reinforce the notion that the enwrapping model is a prominent pathway for DMV formation (21, 23) . The fact that DMVs were still present after IFN-\u2424 treatment suggests that either the enwrapping pathway was only partially blocked or that the remaining DMVs were formed via an alternative mechanism-for example, double budding (23) .",

This indicated that although those ISGs were abundantly expressed after IFN-\u2424 treatment, neither of them had any impact on DMS formation in our study. CH25H turned out not to be expressed after IFN-\u2424 signaling in HuH-7 cells, and treatment of cells with 25HC, the antiviral metabolite synthesized by CH25H, did not visibly affect the EAV nsp2-3-induced DMS.

Because of the time-consuming type of EM analysis required to identify DMS, high-throughput EM analysis of all ISGs is not feasible, and screening would have to rely on other materials and methods, such as pull-down assays or colocalization studies that could reveal promising candidates, which could then be analyzed by EM. A previous high-throughput ISG screen, in which the effect of individual ISGs on virus infection was evaluated using fluorescent reporter viruses, included EAV-GFP (39) . Most hits in that screen were well-characterized ISGs, such as the OAS proteins, which are known to affect other stages of the viral replication cycle or components in the innate immune signaling cascade, such as IRF1, which lead to the expression of a variety of ISGs. This study did not yield obvious candidates that could be responsible for the observed effects on EAV-induced membrane structures, although some of these could be tested to confirm this. Other possible candidates that we have not explored yet are transmembrane ISGs, such as members of the membraneanchored IFITM protein family. Because their main mode of action seems to be the blocking of virus entry from endosomes (40), we do not consider these likely responsible for the effects on replication organelles at present.",

LC3 was shown to label the vacuolar membrane of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii (41) and also the replication organelles induced by murine norovirus, another positivestrand RNA virus. This serves to recruit immunity-related GTPases induced by IFN-\u2425 signaling to disrupt these membranes and control T. gondii and norovirus infections (41, 42) . These pathogen-restricting effects did not depend on the degradative functions of autophagy: rather LC3 seems to function as a \"flag\" that labels foreign membrane structures. Whether similar mechanisms are also in play upon IFN-\u2424 treatment has not been investigated, but is an interesting possibility. Since LC3 (although in some cases also in its nonlipidated form) has been found to colocalize with nidovirus replication organelles (43, 44) , it would be interesting to investigate whether this could be related to antiviral IFN-\u2424 or IFN-\u2425 effects.",

If the reduction in DMS prevalence that was observed after IFN-\u2424 treatment is representative for what happens during an infection, this could directly reduce overall replication efficiency. It should be noted though, that in the case of coronaviruses, the size and number of DMVs observed during infection was reported not to correlate with viral fitness in cell culture (45, 46) . However, impairment of DMV biogenesis could also indirectly affect viral replication, based on their proposed role in the shielding viral PAMPs from cytosolic innate immune sensors. Even though the precise location of arterivirus RNA synthesis remains unclear, the interior of DMVs in EAV-infected cells labels strongly for dsRNA and is enriched for phosphorus, suggesting the abundant presence of viral RNA (13) . The decrease of the number of closed DMVs, as observed after IFN-\u2424 treatment, could render this material accessible to cytosolic innate immune sensors and promote their recognition as a PAMP (47) . Similarly, the exposure of viral RNA to the antiviral action of ISGs could be enhanced: for example, to the ISGs that target viral RNA directly, such as the OAS proteins that indeed very effectively restrict EAV replication if overexpressed (39) .",

This implies that the innate immune system possesses multiple ways to counteract the formation of replication organelles, thus augmenting the importance of these virus-induced double-membrane structures as a target of the antiviral IFN-\u2424 response. HCV and EAV both belong to the DMV-forming class of viruses (4) , and it would be very interesting if membrane structures formed by spherule-forming viruses are also targeted by the innate immune system. If so, the next question would be whether the same or different ISGs are involved. Given the rather large body of literature describing the ultrastructure of viral replication organelles, surprisingly little is known about their actual function during virus replication and the reasons why these replication organelles are such a conserved and prominent feature of positive-strand RNA virus replication. Further investigation of the interactions between antiviral innate immunity and replication organelles will likely provide clues on this matter.",

Seventy-two hours after transfection, the supernatant was harvested, spun down for 10 min at 2,000 rpm, filtered through a 0.45-m-pore filter, and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C until use. Subconfluent HuH-7 cells were transduced with pLenti3.3/TR lentiviral particles in the presence of 8 g/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich), and after 48 h, cells were passaged, and transduced cells were selected with 100 g/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After several passages, the resulting cell line, named HuH-7/tetR, was transduced again with pLenti6.3 constructs containing the nsp2-3GFP (pLenti6.3/HA-nsp2-3GFP) coding sequence, and cells were selected with 12.5 g/ml blasticidin S (PAA Laboratories). Expression of transgenes was induced by the addition of 1 g/ml tetracycline (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the culture media for 24 h. The resulting cell line, HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP, was transduced with lentivirus particles made with the pLentiCrisprv2 vector with guide RNAs targeting viperin or PLSCR1. All lentivirus-transduced cells were maintained as polyclonal cell pools to avoid clonal differences between control cell lines and knockouts after serial transductions and selections, which could potentially delude the results. Cells were passaged at least 10 times before use in experiments to avoid lingering innate immune responses due to lentiviral transduction.",

Data from 3 to 4 meshes were combined and compared to those from parallel control samples. Data sets from individual experiments (e.g., control and IFN-\u2424 treated) were randomized prior to manual annotation to avoid detection bias. Statistical analysis of individual experiments was performed either using a chisquare test (1 degree of freedom) comparing the ratios in different conditions of cell profiles positive for DMS (DMS \u03e9 ) over the total number of cell profiles containing a nucleus or the fraction of cell profiles containing double-membrane sheets out of all DMS \u03e9 cell profiles.
