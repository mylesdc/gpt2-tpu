            "text": "Many positive-strand RNA viruses encode genes that can function in trans, whereas other genes are required in cis for genome replication. The mechanisms underlying trans-and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis-and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3-5B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3-5A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis-and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.",

            "text": "PLOS Pathogens | RNA viruses encode one or more proteins that form an RNA replicase, which serves to propagate the viral RNA genome. Some replication genes can function in trans, meaning that proteins expressed by one viral genome can complement and assist in the replication of a defective mutant virus within the same cell. Other viral genes work in cis, meaning that they are unable to complement defective mutants; these cis-acting genes therefore link the replication of a viral RNA genome to its translation. Because genetic complementation reflects the formation of molecular interactions that were previously absent or nonfunctional, understanding the cis-and trans-activities of viral replication proteins can provide insights into the structure and function of viral replicases. Here we develop a novel methodology to study interactions between components of the viral replicase to define essential cis-and trans-activities for all five hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication gene products. Our studies show that representative defects in each HCV replication protein can be complemented in trans. However, specific features of NS3 and NS5B were required in cis, indicating that these proteins specifically function to replicate the genome that encodes them. These data define important activities of the HCV replication proteins and provide new insight into how these proteins function together as an enzyme complex.",

Mutant viruses may complement or inhibit one another in trans, with important consequences on virus evolution, pathogenesis, and the emergence of drug-resistance [2] [3] [4] [5] . For instance, subgenomic (i.e. less than genome length) defective-interfering (DI) viruses are dependent on, and compete with, helper viruses with intact genomes [6] . Because of this competition, many positive-strand RNA viruses have evolved genome quality control mechanisms that require specific viral genes in cis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In some cases, essential cis-acting RNA sequences or secondary structures are embedded within the viral coding region [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In other cases, RNA replication requires ribosomal translation through a specific gene region, although the gene product is not necessarily required in cis [7, 11, 20] . Finally, some cis-acting viral proteins recruit the RNA from which they were translated into RNA replication complexes [9] [10] [11] 21] .",

Members of this family are genetically diverse but share similarities in genome organization, mechanisms of gene expression, and replication strategies. As a model of RNA replication, the best-characterized member of this family is hepatitis C virus (HCV), a human pathogen that causes chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, and is a major target of antiviral design [23] . The 9.6-kb HCV genome lacks a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail but has highly structured 5' and 3' non-coding regions, as well as an internal RNA cis-replication element (CRE) within the coding region ( Fig 1A) . These RNA structures are important cis-acting sequences that direct translation and replication of the viral genome, including a 5' internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to initiate cap-independent translation.",

RNA replication is thought to occur via de novo (i.e., unprimed) initiation at or near the 3' end of the template genome, production of a complementary negative strand, and iterative use of the negative strand as a secondary template to make many new positive-strand genomes [26, 27] .",

            "text": "Much is known about the structure and function of individual NS3-5B proteins, although the molecular architecture of the replicase is not yet known. NS3 is a bifunctional enzyme, encoding an N-terminal serine protease domain and a C-terminal helicase domain. The serine protease requires interaction with NS4A for optimal activity and is responsible for cleaving the downstream polyprotein [28] ; it also proteolytically inactivates specific cellular substrates including MAVS [29, 30] , TRIF [31] , DDB1 [32] , and GPx8 [33] . The C-terminal RNA helicase/ NTPase activities of NS3 are essential for RNA replication [34, 35] , although the specific roles of these activities are unknown. For instance, this domain can unwind double-stranded RNA and DNA in vitro [36] , but direct evidence is lacking that it binds to or unwinds viral RNA during the replication cycle in vivo. The small NS4A protein binds to NS3, acts as a cofactor for both NS3 activities [28, 37] , and anchors the NS3-4A heterodimer in the membrane [38] . NS4B is a polytopic membrane protein that can oligomerize and may serve as a scaffold for replicase assembly [39, 40] . NS5A is an RNA-binding phosphoprotein that contains an N-terminal amphipathic membrane anchor, a structured zinc-binding domain that directs NS5A homodimerization in either of two alternate conformations, and a large, natively unfolded C-terminal domain [41] . The precise role of NS5A during RNA replication is not yet clear, but it is known to recruit cellular factors essential for replicase assembly and function, including cyclophilin A [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03b1 [47] , and the vesicle trafficking protein VAP-A [48] [49] [50] . NS5B is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has a C-terminal membrane tail anchor [51, 52] . The NS3 serine protease, NS5B polymerase, and NS5A proteins are the major targets of HCV-specific antiviral compounds [23] .",

(L) Complementation of SGR-Gluc(5Bm1), SGR-Gluc (5Bm2), and SGR-Gluc(5Bm3) in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cells. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections done in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls. This experiment was performed three times with similar results. mutations in NS3, NS4A, and NS5B that can be complemented in trans. Whereas NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities could be supplied in trans, NS5B expression was required in cis, suggesting that NS5B has a structural role in replicase assembly. A subset of NS3 activities was required in cis, including the helicase RNA binding and NTPase active site residues, implicating these helicase activities in the recruitment of an RNA template for replication. Complementation group analysis indicated that NS3-4A and NS4B activities are coordinated, whereas NS5B activity requires an intact set of upstream NS3-5A genes. We followed up on this latter observation by showing that NS5B segregates with a daclatasvir-sensitive activity of NS5A. These results reveal new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, provide insights into combination anti-HCV therapy, and establish an experimental platform to study the genetic and functional interactions of gene products from positive-strand RNA viruses.",

To monitor HCV replication levels over time, we used SGR-Gluc (Fig 1A) , an HCV genotype 2a (strain JFH-1) SGR that autonomously replicates and expresses the Gaussia princeps luciferase (Gluc) [65] . At early times post-transfection of Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells with SGR-Gluc RNA transcripts, Gluc expression increased and reached maximal expression by 48 hours (Fig 1D) ; the decline in Gluc activity at later times corresponded with the onset of cytopathic effects caused by JFH-1 replication [55, 64, 66] . In contrast, SGR-Gluc(5Bm1), a mutant replicon containing inactivating point mutations of the Mg ++ -coordinating polymerase active site residues (Table 1) , expressed Gluc only at early time points post-transfection (Fig 1D) , consistent with translation of the input RNA followed by RNA turnover [65] .",

SGR-Gluc efficiently replicated in these cells, whereas SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) did not ( Fig 1E) . Thus, SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) was not trans-complemented in Huh-7.5[SGR-Neo] cells, consistent with prior results indicating that NS5B is not supplied in trans by an active replicon [57, 61, 83] . We hypothesized that active RNA replication competed with complementation, such that NS5B expressed by a replicon might be unavailable to function in trans. To test this idea, we expressed NS3-5B outside the context of a functional HCV replicon by using a recoded 6015-nt NS3-5B gene region containing 1379 silent mutations (Fig 1A, 1F , and S1 Text). The rationale for recoding HCV NS3-5B was to: 1) ensure efficient expression by using preferred human codons; 2) minimize RNA secondary structures, including known and potential cis-acting replication elements within the NS3-5B coding region; and 3) allow for selective amplification of HCV replicons vs. synthetic NS3-5B genes during downstream analysis (e.g. RT-PCR). The recoded NS3-5B region was expressed in Huh-7.5 cells by using a noncytopathic SGR derived from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), a member of the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family of positive-strand RNA viruses. This expression vector was chosen because noncytopathic alphavirus vectors: 1) stably and abundantly express foreign genes [84, 85] ; 2) accommodate large insertions [86] ; and 3) have been used successfully in trans-complementation studies with members of the Flaviviridae, including HCV [86] [87] [88] [89] . After stable transduction of Huh-7.5 cells with the VEEV/NS3-5B vector to produce Huh-7.5 [VEEV/NS3-5B] cells, the HCV NS3-5B polyprotein was expressed at physiologically relevant levels and properly processed through proteolytic cleavage, as evidenced by the patterns of NS3 and NS5A expression (Fig 1G) . NS3-5B expression was stable for many weeks of passage. As a negative control, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed as an irrelevant protein via the VEEV vector (VEEV/GFP).",

However, the dynamic range of trans-complementation (i.e., the ratio between the highest and lowest Gluc signals) was lower for Jc1/Gluc2(5Bm1) than for SGR-Gluc(5Bm1), consistent with the higher replication efficiency of SGRs vs. full-length HCV genomes [55, 97] .

However, the NS5B gene cannot simply be deleted because it contains an RNA structural element, the CRE, required for RNA replication. We therefore inserted a stop codon just downstream of NS5A to create SGR-Gluc (5A \u00c3 5B) ( Table 1 and Fig 2A) . This mutant was unable to replicate, but surprisingly, was not complemented in trans ( Fig 2B) . We considered three explanations for these observations. First, the premature stop codon destabilized the SGR-Gluc(5A \u00c3 5B) RNA. However, SGR-Gluc (5Bm1) and SGR-Gluc(5A \u00c3 5B) expressed similar levels of residual Gluc ( Fig 2B) ; given that nascent Gluc was collected at each time point (Materials and Methods), these data suggest that non-replicating SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) and SGR-Gluc(5A \u00c3 5B) RNAs were turned over at similar rates. Second, RNA replication required ribosomal transit through the NS5B coding region, as has been observed for the 2A-3D coding region of poliovirus [11] . Third, the NS5B protein was required in cis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we designed a strategy to permit ribosomal translation through the NS5B coding region, without NS5B expression, by using an alternate reading frame. First, we designed the SGR-Gluc(5Brc) mutant containing 22 silent mutations in the NS5B coding region that: 1) removed stop codons from the -1 reading frame; 2) maintained the CRE structure; and 3) maintained a stop at codon 592 (Fig 2A and S2 Text) . Thus, this mutant expresses a wild-type NS3-5B polyprotein but uses altered NS5B codon usage to create an untranslated -1 open reading frame. SGR-Gluc(5Brc) autonomously and efficiently replicated, although with slightly delayed kinetics compared to SGR-Gluc (Fig 2C) , indicating that these silent mutations in NS5B had only a minor effect on RNA replication.",

(B) SGR-Gluc(5A*5B) does not replicate and is not complemented in trans. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections done in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls.

(E) The SGR-Gluc(5Brc) and SGR-Gluc(5Bfs) polyproteins are expressed and properly cleaved, as determined by western blot with 4D11 anti-NS3 and 9E10 anti-NS5A monoclonal antibodies. Because these mutants do not replicate, expression was driven by the vaccinia-T7 RNA polymerase system. unknown structure instead of the 66.7-kDa, 591 amino acid NS5B protein (S2 Text). The SGR-Gluc(5Bfs) mutant did not replicate, nor was it trans-complemented ( Fig 2D) . One possible explanation was that the 5Bfs protein non-specifically interfered with HCV replication. However defects in SGR-Gluc replication were not observed when a 5Bfs transgene was expressed in trans, arguing that the 5Bfs-encoded protein did not have a dominant negative effect on replication. We also considered the possibility that the frame-shift could have caused defects in processing of the NS3-5Bfs polyprotein. Because 5Bfs includes the N-terminal 39 amino acids of NS5B, it should allow proper processing of the NS5A/5B junction. Consistent with this, SGR-Gluc(5Bfs) expressed normal levels of NS3 and NS5A but not NS5B (Fig 2E) , indicating that proper cleavage of the polyprotein occurred and that normal levels of NS3 and NS5A were expressed. Together, these data show that the recoded NS3-5B transgene was unable to trans-complement SGR-Gluc(NS5Bfs), a mutant that: 1) lacks a premature stop codon; 2) allows ribosomes to translate through the NS5B coding region; but 3) does not express NS5B. Thus, two mutants lacking NS5B expression, SGR-Gluc(5A \u00c3 5B) and SGR-Gluc(5Bfs), were not complemented in trans. The simplest interpretation of these data is that RNA replication requires NS5B protein translation in cis. Since defects in NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be trans-complemented (Fig 1) , this cis-requirement is therefore independent of the known enzymatic activities of NS5B.",

            "text": "Although the data above suggested that HCV replication required the enzymatic activities of NS3 in cis, two alternative interpretations are that these specific NS3 mutations: 1) destabilized the inactive NS3 proteins, which could be required in cis; or 2) disrupted underlying RNA structures within the NS3 gene that are required in cis. Western blot analysis indicated that the 3m3 and 3m5 mutations caused slight ( 2-fold) increases in NS3 accumulation, and that the 3m4 mutation had no effect on NS3 accumulation ( Fig 3D) . As expected, the 3m1 mutation abrogated serine protease cleavage activity and caused accumulation of an unprocessed NS3-5B polyprotein ( Fig 3D) . These data show that the helicase mutations did not inhibit NS3 protein accumulation. To examine whether the NS3 mutations disrupted a putative underlying RNA structure required for replication, we replaced a large portion of a full-length HCV genome with the corresponding NS3-5A region from the recoded NS3-5B cassette, creating the Jc1-Gluc(3-5Arc) mutant ( Fig 3E and Table 1 ). This mutant contained 524 silent mutations, including the NS3 RNA binding and NTPase active site codons T269, D290, and E291 that had been mutated in 3m3 and 3m4 (S3 Text). As expected, the recoded NS3 gene also exhibited pronounced differences in predicted RNA secondary structure (S2 Fig) . The Jc1-Gluc(3-5Arc) mutant replicated efficiently with only a slight delay in kinetics ( Fig 3F) ; it is therefore unlikely Values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections done in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls. This experiment was performed two times with similar results. (B) Helicase RNA binding and NTPase active site mutants SGR-Gluc (3m3) and SGR-Gluc(3m4) do not replicate and are not complemented in trans. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections done in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls. For comparison, the SGR-Gluc samples, which were performed in parallel, are reproduced from panel A. This experiment was performed two times with similar results. (C) RNA helicase base stacking mutant SGR-Gluc(3m5) does not replicate but is complemented in trans with an efficiency similar to SGR-Gluc(5m1). For comparison, the SGR-Gluc samples, which were performed in parallel, are reproduced from panel A. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections done in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls; *, p < 0.05; **, p <0.01 by Student's t-test, comparing matched time points from SGR-Gluc(3m5) in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] vs. Huh-7.5[VEEV/GFP] cells. This experiment was performed two times with similar results. (D) Western blot to confirm that the serine protease active site mutant SGR-Gluc(3m1) does not undergo polyprotein cleavage and that the RNA helicase mutants SGR-Gluc(3m2), SGR-Gluc(3m3), SGR-Gluc(3m4), and SGR-Gluc(3m5) do not exhibit defects in NS3 accumulation. NS3 was that the 3m3 and 3m4 mutations disrupted an important RNA element in the NS3 gene region. Given that the inactivating NS3 helicase mutations did not inhibit NS3 protein accumulation nor disrupt important RNA secondary structures, we conclude that HCV RNA replication requires the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 RNA helicase domain in cis. While the serine protease activity is required in cis because it is needed for polyprotein processing (Fig 3G) , the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the helicase domain are likely needed for a post-translational step in replication, such as RNA template recruitment (Fig 3H) .",

Consistent with these results, SGR-Gluc(4Bm1) and SGR-Gluc(5Am1) ( Table 1) We then examined whether multiple defects could be complemented simultaneously by combining two (3m6 and 5Bm1), three (4Am1, 4Bm1, and 5Am1), or five inactivating mutations (3m6, 4Am1, 4Bm1, 5Am1, and 5Bm1) within the SGR-Gluc replicon ( Table 1 ). All of the combined mutants replicated in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cells but not in Huh-7.5[VEEV/ GFP] cells (Fig 5A-5C ). The efficiency of complementation inversely correlated with the number of mutations; nevertheless, replication levels were statistically significant and sensitive to DCV treatment, confirming that these signals were due to active HCV replication. None of the combined mutants replicated in Huh-7.5[SGR-Neo] cells (S4A-S4C Fig). To examine the long-term trans-complementation of a mutant containing multiple defects, we used G418 selection of a mutant SGR-Neo replicon. As shown in Fig 5D, SGR-Neo(3-5Bm) stably replicated and formed G418-resistant colonies in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cells but not in Huh-7.5 [VEEV/GFP] cells.

To do so, we first created Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cell lines containing the 3m6, 4Am1, 4Bm1, 5Am1, and 5Bm1 mutations within the recoded NS3-5B transgene. Wild-type SGR-Gluc replicated similarly in all cell lines (Fig 6A) , indicating that the mutant NS3-5B transgenes did not have dominant negative effects on HCV replication. A panel of SGR-Gluc NS3-5B mutants was then tested for complementation in these cell lines. As expected, each SGR-Gluc mutant failed to replicate in cells expressing the NS3-5B transgene containing a defect in the same gene (Fig 6) , thus defining distinct complementation groups. Nonetheless, the efficiency of transcomplementation varied among mutant genes, suggesting that functional interactions exist between the corresponding gene products. Notably, the 3m6 mutant replicated less efficiently in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B(4Bm1)] cells than in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cells ( Fig 6B) ; the 4Am1 mutant replicated less efficiently in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B(3m6)] and Huh-7.5 [VEEV/NS3-5B(4Bm1)] cells than in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B] cells ( Fig 6C) ; and the 4Bm1 mutant replicated less efficiently in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B(3m6)] cells than in Huh-7.5 [VEEV/NS3-5B] cells (Fig 6D) . These data indicate that the NS3-4A and NS4B activities were enhanced by co-expression of these genes from the same polyprotein ( Fig 6G) . However, the most notable effect was that SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) failed to replicate in Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B Fig 6F) . These data indicate that trans-complementing activity of NS5B depends on upstream NS3-5A activities within the same polyprotein (Fig 6H) , consistent with our observation that the 5Bm1 mutant was not trans-complemented by expression of NS5B alone (S1A Fig). In contrast, the efficient replication of SGR-Gluc(3m6), SGR-Gluc(4Am1), SGR-Gluc(4Bm1), and SGR-Gluc(5Am1) on Huh-7.5[VEEV/NS3-5B(5Bm1)] cells (last column of Fig 6B-6F) indicates that the activity of NS5B in cis does not depend on upstream NS3-5A activities (Fig 6I) .",

Given that transcomplementation of NS5B is linked to the function of upstream NS3-5A genes, we hypothesized that NS5B activity would segregate with sensitivity to an HCV-specific direct acting antiviral compound targeting an upstream gene product. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the complementation of the lethal 5Bm1 mutation in combination with DCV R , a point Table 1 ) that shifts the EC 50 of DCV by >7,500-fold and renders HCV resistant to DCV [59] . As expected, replication of the SGR-Gluc(DCV R ) mutant was resistant to DCV (Fig 7A) . When the DCV R mutation was introduced into VEEV/NS3-5B or VEEV/NS3-5B(5Bm1), SGR-Gluc replication was resistant to DCV but showed a kinetic lag (Fig 7B and  7E ), again confirming that NS5A can be supplied in trans. Surprisingly, trans-complementation of the SGR-Gluc(5Bm1,DCV R ) double mutant was sensitive to DCV (Fig 7C and 7F) . However, trans-complementation of SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) was resistant to DCV when the DCV R mutation was introduced into VEEV/NS3-5B (Fig 7D and 7G) . These data show that NS5A, and in particular, the DCV-sensitive function of NS5A, can function in trans, independent of NS5B. However, the trans-complementation activity of NS5B segregated with an NS5A activity that was sensitive to DCV, again confirming that NS5B is linked functionally to upstream NS3-5A activities within the same polyprotein.",

            "text": "How do viral genes and their gene products work in cis? In the simplest case, a viral coding region can contain an important RNA sequence or secondary structure, such as the CREs present within the poliovirus 2C gene [15, 16] or HCV NS5B gene [17] [18] [19] . In other cases, the process of RNA translation is required although the protein product may be irrelevant, such as the ORF encoded by DIs of mouse hepatitis virus [7, 20] . As previously noted by Novak and Kirkegaard [11] , such cis-translational requirements can be explained by ribosome-induced structural changes within the RNA template (Fig 8A) , or by recruitment of ribosome-associated factors to the template. Finally, cis-acting viral proteins can recruit the RNA from which they were translated into a replication complex. For instance, the nascent N-terminal polypeptide of bovine coronavirus nsp1 targets its RNA template to sites of replication [9] ; a similar mechanism has been observed for brome mosaic virus 2a protein [98] . In these cases, the nascent polypeptides are linked physically to the RNA through the actively translating ribosome ( Fig  8B) . Alternatively, cis-acting proteins that have completed synthesis may bind preferentially to their RNA template (Fig 8C) due to spatial limitations, such as physical barriers to protein diffusion, or temporal restrictions, such rapid protein turnover [11] . Similar mechanisms have been put forth to explain cis-acting proteins encoded by DNA viruses and other mobile genetic elements [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] .",

These data agree with prior studies, which used replicons as the source of NS5B [57, 61, 83] . However, NS5B could function in trans when it was expressed as part of a synthetic NS3-5B polyprotein. We envision two nonexclusive mechanisms by which this could occur within a replication complex: 1) by intermingling of NS proteins and exchange of NS5B ( Fig 8D) ; and/or 2) by transfer of template RNA (Fig 8E) . In favor of the RNA transfer model, SGR-Gluc(5Bm1) was not complemented when NS5B was expressed alone (Fig 8F) , nor was it complemented by NS3-5B polyproteins containing defects in NS3, NS4A, NS4B, or NS5A ( Fig 6H) . Thus, trans-complementation of NS5B may utilize RNA transfer; at the molecular level, this could reflect a propensity of NS5B to remain associated with the NS proteins with which it was translated. Nevertheless, protein exchange likely occurs during complementation of other viral proteins. For instance NS5A activity segregates promiscuously, independent of other NS protein activities.",

We excluded nonspecific effects caused by a premature stop codon and a potential requirement for ribosomal transit through the NS5B coding region. These data indicate that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly that is independent of its RNA binding and polymerase activities. Recent work has shown that the RNA polymerase of poliovirus plays an important, non-enzymatic role in RNA replication by assembling twodimensional, membrane-bound oligomeric lattices that enhance RNA binding and synthesis through cooperativity [105] [106] [107] . Intriguingly, HCV NS5B also forms oligomers that show cooperativity in RNA synthesis rates [108] . Together, these data lend support to a conserved, structural role for viral polymerases during positive-strand RNA virus replicase assembly.",

Analogously, trans-complementation of the NS5 polymerase from the related West Nile virus (subtype Kunjin; genus Flavivirus) also requires co-expression of upstream NS proteins [86] , suggesting this may be common within the Flaviviridae. We found that HCV NS5B was functionally linked to NS5A, and more specifically, to the DCV-sensitive function of NS5A translated from the same polyprotein. Fridell and colleagues used SGR transcomplementation to define three NS5A complementation groups and showed that the DCVsensitive function of NS5A works preferentially in cis [59, 60] . In contrast, we found that the DCV R allele of NS5A can function in trans when it was expressed from a synthetic NS3-5B mRNA. Thus, the cis-preferences of NS5A and NS5B can be overcome by expressing NS3-5B outside the context of a functional replicon.",

Similar results were observed for NS5A complementation with bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1), a related member of the Flaviviridae [13] . These observations may be related to the influence of upstream proteins on the phosphorylation status and interactome of NS5A [109] [110] [111] [112] . Thus, there appears to be multiple layers of cislinkage, whereby NS5B activity is dependent on upstream NS5A activity (this study), which in turn is linked to the activities of NS3-4A and NS4B. This network of linkages could serve as a quality control mechanism to reduce the emergence of DI genomes despite the ability of NS3-5A to function in trans. In this regard, deletions in the NS3-5B region have not been observed in naturally occurring HCV deletion mutants [55, [113] [114] [115] .",

We predict that NS5A inhibitors like DCV may have synergistic effects when combined with inhibitors of the viral polymerase. Furthermore, the barrier for resistance to drugs targeting NS5A and NS5B may be high because replicase-expressed NS5B does not complement in trans and is linked to the daclatasvir-sensitive activity of upstream NS5A; thus resistant alleles would need to arise within the same genome. It is notable that DCV and sofosbuvir combination therapy shows high rates of sustained virological response in HCV-infected patients [117] .",

These data suggest that a protease inhibitor-sensitive virus would not be trans-complemented by an inhibitor-resistant virus in vivo. Defects in the NS3 RNA binding and NTPase activities also were not complemented in trans. We excluded nonspecific effects caused by instability of the mutant NS3 proteins or disruption of underlying cis-acting RNA structures within this region of the viral genome. Our data are most consistent with a requirement for the HCV NS3 RNA binding and NTPase activities in cis. Similarly, for other Flaviviridae, the BVDV-1 NS3 NTPase active site residues are required in cis [13, 118] , whereas a West Nile virus NS3 helicase mutant was transcomplemented with very low efficiency [14] .",

The NS3 W501 residue has a key role in RNA unwinding. Structurally, W501 stacks against the 3'-most base of RNA and DNA template strands and may keep the template in register for up to three single-nucleotide translocation steps [72, 74, 76] . In vitro, NS3 proteins containing the W501A mutation retain RNA binding and NTPase activities [73, 75, 119] ; such mutants have defects in RNA unwinding but can unwind DNA [75, 77] . Thus, the NS3 W501A mutant, SGR/Gluc(3m5), has basal helicase activity but likely has a defect in processivity on RNA templates. While it has been established that HCV helicase activity is required for RNA replication [34, 35] , the function of the helicase has been unclear, including whether it binds to or unwinds viral RNA during replication. Given that post-translational cis-preferences rely on protein-RNA interaction (Fig 8C) , our data suggest that the RNA binding and NTPase activities, but not RNA unwinding activity, contribute to RNA template recruitment (Fig 3H) . Remarkably, the RNA helicase/NTPase of brome mosaic virus also recruits viral RNA into membrane-bound replication complexes [120] . Thus, RNA template recruitment may be a conserved function of positive-strand RNA virusencoded helicases.",

The helicase activity of recombinant NS3-4A protein containing the 4Am1 mutation (NS4A Y45A) has efficient basal RNA-binding activity, but severely reduced ATP-coupled RNA binding, RNA-stimulated ATPase activity, and RNA unwinding [37] .

These experiments revealed functional interactions between NS3-4A and NS4B: 3m6-and 4Am1-mutant replicons were trans-complemented less efficiently in cells expressing the 4Bm1-mutant form of NS3-5B, whereas 4Am1-and 4Bm1-mutant replicons were trans-complemented less efficiently in cells expressing the 3m6-mutant form of NS3-5B. One interpretation of these data is that NS3-4A and NS4B preferentially interact with each other from the same polyprotein (Fig 6G) . Given that the NS3-4A-4B complementation grouping was reciprocal, it was surprising that 3m6-and 4Bm1-mutant replicons replicated well on cells expressing the 4Am1-mutant form of NS3-5B. Furthermore, it was surprising that NS3 and NS4A activities segregated independently given that proteolytic processing of the NS3/NS4A junction is autocatalytic [121] and is predicted to lead to cis-preferential interaction between NS3 and NS4A [122] . One possible explanation is that NS3-4A dimerizes, such that one monomer provides NS3 activity while the other provides NS4A activity ( Fig 8H) . Indeed, we recently demonstrated that the NS4A transmembrane domain mediates homodimerization that is essential for RNA replication [80] . Alternatively, a second explanation might be that NS3-4A heterodimers exchange partners to form a single fully active NS3-4A heterodimer (Fig 8H) .",

It is notable that a few HCV \"minigenome\" systems have been developed [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] . HCV minigenomes are RNAs encoding a reporter gene flanked by the HCV 5' and 3' noncoding regions; because they lack NS protein expression, minigenomes are presumably replicated in trans by HCV replicons or NS3-5B transgene expression. Given the cis-requirements of NS3 and NS5B described here, it is surprising that minigenomes can be replicated in trans. However, minigenome replication levels have not been compared directly to replicon or infectious virus replication levels, nor has their sensitivity to HCV-specific antiviral compounds been demonstrated. A key feature of these systems is that minigenome RNAs are produced continuously through transcription of transfected cDNA; hence they may represent a single round of RNA synthesis rather than bona fide RNA replication and amplification. In this regard, NS5B is capable of nonspecific RNA synthesis, in the absence of other HCV NS proteins, when overexpressed in cell culture [128, 129] . In contrast, the trans-replication system we describe here supports authentic, long-term replication of defective HCV replicons initiated by RNA transfection.",

NS3-4A and NS4B activities co-segregated in complementation group analysis, whereas NS5B activity was dependent on the function of upstream NS3-5A genes. Together, these studies reveal a network of functional interactions that could serve as a quality control mechanism for the HCV replicase genes and can be exploited by combination therapies targeting multiple NS protein activities.",

(D) Complementation of full-length HCV reporter virus Jc1/Gluc2A(5Bm1) in Huh-7.5[VEE/NS3-5B] cells. All values represent mean \u00b1 SD from transfections performed in triplicate and normalized to untransfected controls; experiments were repeated three times with similar results. (E) Sanger sequencing of trans-complemented SGR-Neo(5Bm1) after three weeks of G418 selection and two weeks of additional passage. Total RNA was extracted from G418-resistant cells with Trizol reagent, HCV-specific cDNA was synthesized, the NS5B gene region was amplified by RT-PCR, and the PCR product was directly sequenced. For comparison, a parallel sequence of VEE/NS3-5B DNA is shown. (PDF) ",
