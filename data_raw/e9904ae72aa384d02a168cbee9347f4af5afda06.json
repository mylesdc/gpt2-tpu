            "text": "Influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; family Pneumoviridae) are both single-strand RNA viruses and cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . Influenza virus and RSV are spread by droplet and contact transmission. Therefore, nosocomial acquisition may occur due to exposure to another infected patient, visitor or healthcare workers (HCWs), as well as by contact with contaminated, inanimate surfaces. Immunocompromised patients with underlying hemato-oncological disorders or cancer are at risk for increased mortality, especially in the case of lower respiratory tract infection due to these viruses [5] , [6] , [7] . Both community and nosocomial acquisition of influenza and RSV are possible in this patient group. Nosocomial outbreaks in oncologic care facilities have been described [8] , [9] in spite of multiple infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission. These measures include stringent hand hygiene, patient isolation, and use of barrier precautions such as surgical masks or vaccination (influenza) [5] , [10] , [11] , [12] . During a localized nosocomial cluster with RSV at our clinic in the winter season 2015/2016, we introduced a RT-PCR-based screening of asymptomatic patients for RSV and influenza virus which contributed to the successful control of the RSV cluster [13] . To strengthen our existing infection control measures in hematology and oncology, we subsequently implemented a systematic influenza and RSV screening of patients lacking respiratory symptoms on a pediatric and an adult hemato-oncological ward as a prophylactic infection control measure in the following winter (2016/2017). This screening intended to identify patients shedding RSV or influenza virus without signs of disease and -in case of a positive screening test -to establish infection control measures similar to those used for typical symptomatic (e.g. cough, sneezing, fever, respiratory distress) patients with RSV or influenza. In this paper, we describe the laboratory results of this prophylactic screening program for asymptomatic patients (season 2016/2017) and discuss its value for infection control in hematology and oncology.",

The adult ward has 4 single (one-bed) rooms, 6 two-bed rooms, and 3 four-bed rooms. All single rooms on the pediatric ward and 3 single rooms on the adult ward have an anteroom and high-efficiency particulate air filtration with the air flow directed to the hallway. Single rooms are usually reserved for patients with severe immunosuppression or palliative settings. The wards are serviced by permanent healthcare workers (HCWs) and housekeeping staff.

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections caused by RSV and influenza virus are a significant healthcare risk for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with underlying hemato-oncological disease. During the winter season, acquisition of these viruses typically occurs in the community, and patients may be admitted with symptoms of infection or infection to a hospital. Nosocomial acquisition due to transmission occurs as well [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Recom-mendations and suggestions for controlling the spread of influenza and RSV in healthcare settings in general and especially in hemato-oncological patients exist (e.g. [5] , [10] ), but should be adapted to each hospital's specific needs. To extend our existing standard infection control measures, we introduced a prophylactic screening program for asymptomatic patients targeting RSV and influenza on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. The screening was intended to detect patients that shed the virus without having signs or symptoms of disease. Shedding my occur before the onset of disease (incubation period), during an asymptomatic clinical course, or following disease as a result of prolonged viral shedding, particularly in the immunocompromised host [19] . These groups of asymptomatic patients, who often remain unnoticed, can contribute to nosocomial spread. Of the 23 asymptomatic shedders, we detected an increased viral load in 6 patients in follow-up specimens (see Table 2 ). It is likely that these patients were in the incubation period. This group of patients is of particular interest for infection control strategies, since with increasing viral load, the risk of transmission also rises. We identified 23 of a total of 251 asymptomatic patients with an RSV or influenza virus infection (detection rate of about 9%).This means that about 11 asymptomatic patients needed to be screened to detect one shedder of either RSV or influenza virus. Other studies found a similar prevalence in asymptomatic individuals for influenza (8.3%) and RSV (4.4%) using RT-PCR [20] , [21] . Campbell et al. examined samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients prior to hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT) in a study to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with respiratory virus detection before HSCT [22] . During a 5-year period, 308 asymptomatic adult and pediatric patients were screened, but only one patient with RSV and none with influenza virus were identified. Interestingly, this study found other viruses (e.g., human rhinovirus or coronavirus) in 23 patients. These respiratory viruses were not included in our screening program, as they rarely cause severe lower respiratory tract disease. 13 out of 23 asymptomatic patients who tested positive for RSV or influenza virus in our study occupied shared patient rooms at the time of virus detection. The majority were moved to single rooms (one-bed rooms) or cohorting was used. Droplet and contact precautions were used for all affected patients. Isolation and barrier precautions regarding virus shedders is important, as transmission to roommates has been described [16] . The transfer to single (one-bed) rooms was challenging in some cases, due to the lack of single-room availability. Nonetheless, because of the high mortality rate of RSV and influenza infection in hemato-oncological patients, isolation and barrier precautions were enforced. With these measures, we aimed to lower the risk of patient-to-patient transmission by reducing the exposure of contact patients. The usage of droplet and contact precautions (such as surgical mask and gown) was also intended to reduce exposure of HCWs. All HCWs, whether vaccinated against influenza or not, wore masks when they performed care in patients with RSV or influenza virus. A further benefit of early detection of influenza virus is the possibility of early antiviral therapy for infected patients and prophylaxis with antiviral agents for contact patients [5] . An additional effect of the screening program and the associated audits and feedback talks was the heightened awareness among HCWs and visitors for respiratory viral infections in this highly susceptible, immunocompromised patient population. During the screening period, no nosocomial cluster of influenza virus or RSV was observed on the two wards. Our investigation has limitations. First, it relied on virological laboratory data analyzed retrospectively. Further information, such as the clinical course and outcome of the patients identified by screening, was not accessible for this study. We therefore could not correlate the laboratory results with the clinical course of the patients. Viral loads were estimated semi-quantitatively by comparing ct values of real-time PCR between positive screening and follow-up specimens. However, this approach has been established for respiratory specimens by previous studies on influenza and various other pathogens [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] .",

Infection control is based on standard precautions (e.g., compliance with hand hygiene, cough etiquette, etc.) together with RSV and influenza pathogenspecific precautionary measures (e.g. droplet precautions, isolation). In special high-risk settings such as hematology and oncology units, additional measures can be useful to lower the risk of hospital acquisition of RSV and influenza. Therefore, we implemented a prophylactic RT-PCRbased RSV and influenza screening program targeting asymptomatic patients. This seasonal screening program enabled us to identify 23 patients who lacked symptoms for respiratory disease, but were infected with either RSV or influenza during a period of about 4 months. For these patients the same infection control practices were implemented as for symptomatic patients with RSV and influ-enza infection. In our view, this screening program proved useful for identifying asymptomatically infected patients with viral shedding, thus reducing the risk of transmission and potential nosocomial clusters of RSV and influenza virus on hemato-oncological wards. Nevertheless, future studies on larger cohorts, including the analyses of clinical data, are necessary to further validate the use of a seasonal screening program as suggested here.",
