            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new coronavirus that has been causing severe and fatal acute respiratory illnesses in humans since its outbreak in 2012, has raised public fear worldwide. The development of prophylactics and therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent and control MERS-CoV infections. In this study, a bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed, and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the MERS-CoV RBD through a protein anchor (PA). The designs included different numbers of lysin motif (LysM) repeats in the PAs linked by linkers (RBD-linker-PA2 (RLP 2 ), RBD-linker-PA3 (RLP 3 ) and RBD-PA3 (RP 3 )), and three LysM repeats and a linker in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the RBD. The specific immune responses were tested by intranasally immunizing mice with RLP 3 -GEM with or without the adjuvant GEL01. The results showed that GEL01-adjuvanted RLP 3 -GEM increased the systemic humoral, cellular and local mucosal immune responses in the mouse model, especially in the intestinal tract. The above results indicate that the MERS-CoV BLP product has the potential to be developed into a promising mucosal candidate vaccine to protect against MERS-CoV infections.",

PA2 genes encoding two LysMs were amplified by PCR using codon-optimized pUC57-PA3 (L. lactis MG1363) as a template with the oligonucleotide primers linker-PA2-F and PA3-R. The PCR fragment of RLP 2 was amplified by a second PCR using the last products of the RBD and PA2 genes as templates with the oligonucleotide primers RBD-F and PA3-R. The resulting construct was digested with XbaI and KpnI and then inserted into the pFastBac1-HBM plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to generate the recombinant plasmid pFastBac1-RLP 2 . To construct the recombinant genes RLP 3 and RP 3 , the genes were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pFastBac1-HBM plasmid with XbaI and KpnI digestion, generating the recombinant plasmids pFastBac1-RLP3 and pFastBac1-RP3, respectively. PFastBac1-RLP 2 , pFastBac1-RLP 3 and pFastBac1-RP 3 were then separately transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells to generate recombinant bacmids (rBacmid-RLP 2 , rBacmid-RLP 3 and rBacmid-RP 3 ). Then, the recombinant bacmids were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) insect cells using liposome 3000 according to the Bac-to-Bac expression system manual (Invitrogen, USA) and cultured in 6-well plates at 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL to generate the recombinant baculoviruses, rBV-RLP 2 , rBV-RLP 3 , or rBV-RP 3 .

Under the stimulation of RBD proteins, splenocytes harvested from mice intranasally immunized with RLP3-GEM plus GEL01 proliferated more efficiently than those from mice immunized with RLP3-GEM without GEL01 (Figure 5a) . Therefore, these data suggested that GEL01 could evoke potent antigen-specific immune responses. To analyze whether intranasally RLP 3 -GEM-immunized mice could produce systemic humoral immune responses, specific serum antibody levels were determined by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and ELISA. GEL01 is a commercial adjuvant based on a polymer technology, already applied in the adjuvant for veterinary vaccine field, and can be used in parenteral and mucosal immunity. To decide whether the GEL01 could enhance the immune response of the RLP 3 -GEM in mice or not, we intranasally immunized mice with it. Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay data showed that RLP 3 -GEM and RLP 3 -GEM plus GEL01 induced strong neutralization against an MERS-CoV infection, and the latter displayed a much higher neutralizing titer than the former (Figure 4b) . A similar phenomenon was also found for the RBD-specific IgG (Figure 4c ), IgG1 (Figure 4d) , and IgG2a (Figure 4d ) antibodies in the sera at eight wpi caused by RLP 3 -GEM and RLP 3 -GEM plus GEL01. Meanwhile, the ratios of IgG2a/IgG1 of RLP3-GEM plus GEL01 were much higher than those of RLP 3 -GEM (Figure 4e) , suggesting that GEL01 could induce a Th1-polarized immune response. Collectively, these data showed that RLP 3 -GEM could induce systemic immune responses and that the adjuvant GEL01 could significantly enhance antibody responses.",

Splenocytes were collected from immunized mice and were ex vivo restimulated with RBD; then, the Th1 (IFN-r, TNF-a, and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) cytokines in the supernatants were detected by ELISA. The levels of these cytokines in the RLP3-GEM with GEL01 group were significantly higher than those in the RLP3-GEM group ( Figure 6 ). The ELISpot assay showed that the amount of splenocytes secreting IFN-r and IL-4 was also remarkably increased in the RLP3-GEM with GEL01 group, similar to the results of the ELISA.

Previous results showed that MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines have displayed effective immunogenicity against MERS-CoV challenges in mice [6, 22, 24] . Some studies have shown that the recombinant RBD of MERS-CoV spike protein with intranasal vaccination induced more robust local mucosal immune responses in the lung and stronger systemic cellular immune responses than that with subcutaneous vaccination in mice, demonstrating that intranasal RBD-based subunit vaccines are a safe and effective means to prevent MERS-CoV infections [42] . A study demonstrated that MERS-CoV could replicate robustly in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal organoids, and small intestine explants and could resist fed-state gastrointestinal fluids, causing enteric MERS-CoV infection [8] . Therefore, it is extremely important for MERS-CoV vaccination to induce respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosal immunity. In this study, we developed RBD-based MERS-CoV subunit vaccines with a novel bacterial antigen display system and evaluated the immunogenicity of specific mucosal immunity in lung and intestinal mucosa and the systemic immune responses due to immunization via the intranasal route.",

The particles boiled in acids mainly consist of bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres, lack other cell wall components and intracellular materials and are recognized as being especially safe [28] . The particles can bind to exogenous antigens by a PA with a high affinity and a high loading capacity [30] . In addition to the above advantages, the particles can bind to the chimeric anchor fusion proteins in culture medium at room temperature in an efficient, strong, and selective manner; the particles can only need a one-step centrifugation process to obtain the purified fusion proteins without the extra purification steps [31] ; it is easier to obtain purified antigens in a bacterium-like particles vaccine compared with the virus-like particles vaccine. The GEM-PA system has been applied in a variety of animal models and has shown strong antigen-specific systemic immune responses with parenteral vaccination and both robust local and systemic responses induced by mucosal vaccination; this system has even proven to be protective against specific pathogens, including parasites, bacteria and viruses [33, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .

            "text": "In this GEM-PA system, PA is the LysM from the C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of AcmA, an autolysin from Lactococcus lactis, and binds to GEM particles in a noncovalent manner. One of the important factors determining the binding activity of fusion proteins is the number of LysMs. In the wild, the number of LysM domains in the proteins differs greatly [49] . In the current study, the optimal number of LysM domains in the GEM-PA system for proper function are different in different groups [30, 36, 37] . The possible reason for this was that fusion proteins fused to different target proteins. Our results showed that the binding activity of RLP 3 was remarkably higher than that of RLP 2 in GEM particles, which is consistent with the results of Kenji Okano and Anton Steen [36, 50] . LysM domains are often separated from the other domains and from each other through linker sequences, raising speculation about LysM domain mobility and flexibility to the fused target proteins and allowing the proteins to attain an optimal orientation in binding with the cell wall [35] . Our results showed that the binding activity of RLP 3 was slightly higher than that of RP 3 . Furthermore, there were significant differences in the neutralizing activity among the sera of mice intramuscularly immunized with RLP 3 -GEM and RP 3 -GEM. These results clearly suggested that the linker peptides between the PA and RBD proteins could increase the binding capacity of the PA and the immunogenicity of the RBD in the fusion proteins. Consistent with those results, linkers in the recombinant fusion proteins could improve the biological activity of functional domains [51] . Thus, this study represents a significant advancement in the development of the GEM-PA system. MERS-CoV transmission from camels to humans is via respiratory droplets or saliva during direct contact with infected camels or through the consumption of contaminated camel milk or meat [8] . A more effective MERS-CoV vaccine should not only provide protection against the invasion of MERS-CoV in the blood but also provide protection against invasive infections in the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, developing an MERS-CoV alternative vaccine with mucosal immune responses is necessary. In this study, we further demonstrated that RLP 3 -GEM was a promising candidate for intranasal immunization with the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. Moreover, we used GEL01 as an adjuvant for intranasal vaccination. This is because GEL01, a polymer of a sodium polyacrylate-based adjuvant, can enhance the protective effects of live vaccines through mucosal immunity [52] . Our results showed that RLP 3 -GEM (PLPs) induced strong neutralization against MERS-CoV pseudotyped virus infections and RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses in sera, and these responses also significantly increased in the presence of the GEL01 adjuvant. IgG2a is the most effective in activating immune cells, and the ratios of IgG2a/IgG1 indicate Th1/Th2 polarization [53] . Moreover, the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 for IgG induced by BLPs plus GEL01 was higher than that of the BLPs alone, suggesting that GEL01 showed adjuvanticity to induce a Th1-polarized immune response. SIgA antibodies may limit MERS-CoV replication at mucosal surfaces. Our data showed that intranasally immunized BLPs could induce mucosal sIgA, especially in the small intestine, confirming that the BLP vaccine could induce strong local mucosal immunity via the intranasal route. To our knowledge, this is the first report that showed successful generation of sIgA in the small intestine among the published MERS-CoV vaccine candidates.",

The results showed that the BLP vaccine could increase splenocyte proliferation. CD69 is an early marker of activated immune cells [54] . We observed that B cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells from immunized mouse splenocytes activated more rapidly than those from mock mice once restimulated by antigen. Next, Th1 (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) in the splenocyte supernatants were detected by ELISA and/or ELISpot. The levels from the BLP vaccine in the presence of the GEL01 adjuvant were higher than those from the BLP vaccine alone. Taken together, GEL01 as a BLP adjuvant can strongly induce systemic and local mucosal immunity. This may be because sodium polyacrylate, the mainly component of the GEL01 adjuvant, promotes the retention of antigens and sustains the release of antigens in the nasal mucosa; in addition, this adjuvant recruits immune cells to the nasal mucosa by the inflammatory response [55] .",

GEL01-adjuvanted MERS-CoV bacterium-like particles are a promising candidate vaccine, and a protective efficacy evaluation of the vaccine in animal models will be considered for future studies. ",
