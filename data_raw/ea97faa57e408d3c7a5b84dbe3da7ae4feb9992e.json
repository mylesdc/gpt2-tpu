We compared laboratory developed real-time PCR assays for detection of Mycoplasma hominis and for detection and differentiation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and parvum to culture using genitourinary specimens submitted for M. hominis and Ureaplasma culture. Methods. 283 genitourinary specimens received in the clinical bacteriology laboratory for M. hominis and Ureaplasma species culture were evaluated. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Total Nucleic Acid Kit on the MagNA Pure 2.0. 5 L of the extracts were combined with 15 L of each of the two master mixes. Assays were performed on the LightCycler 480 II system. Culture was performed using routine methods. Results. M. hominis PCR detected 38/42 M. hominis culture-positive specimens, as well as 2 that were culture negative (sensitivity, 90.5%; specificity, 99.2%). Ureaplasma PCR detected 139/144 Ureaplasma culture-positive specimens, as well as 9 that were culture negative (sensitivity, 96.5%; specificity, 93.6%). Of the specimens that tested positive for Ureaplasma species, U. urealyticum alone was detected in 33, U. parvum alone in 109, and both in 6. Conclusion. The described PCR assays are rapid alternatives to culture for detection of M. hominis and Ureaplasma species, and, unlike culture, the Ureaplasma assay easily distinguishes U. urealyticum from parvum.",

They lack a cell wall (preventing staining with Gram stain) and are not sensitively detected on routine bacterial cultures. Optimal recovery requires specialized media and growth conditions. There are several human pathogens in the genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma which are responsible for a variety of clinical manifestations involving multiple body systems [1] . M. hominis causes septic arthritis and postpartum fever and has been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and bacterial vaginosis [2] . Ureaplasma species can cause acute urethritis and have been associated with bacterial vaginosis, preterm birth, and neonatal respiratory disease [1, 3] .",

Finally, extragenital M. hominis infection was diagnosed in three patients using a real-time PCR assay targeting the M. hominis 16S ribosomal RNA gene [7] . There has been more work on real-time PCR assays for Ureaplasma species, although some have described assays but have not evaluated clinical specimens or clinical isolates [8] . A real-time PCR assay that detects and distinguishes U. urealyticum from parvum was described but used to assess 87 vaginal swabs [9] . Tang et al. used a real-time PCR assay that detects and distinguishes U. parvum and urealyticum to test 346 genitourinary swabs; 120 were positive for the former and 21 for the latter, including 5 positive for both [10] . Finally, Vancutsem et al. used a real-time PCR assay for detection and differentiation of U. urealyticum and parvum to evaluate 300 lower genital tract specimens; 132 were culture positive, of which all plus an additional 19 were PCR-positive (19, U. urealyticum; 120, U. parvum; 12, Ureaplasma species) [11] .",
