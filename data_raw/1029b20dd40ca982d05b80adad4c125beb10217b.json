            "text": "Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues-liver, lung, and kidney-in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.",

These mechanisms can be informed by genome-wide experiments that provide data on variations in molecular and cellular states in genotyped individuals. Most examples of such data, though, are largely observational, due in part to constraints of specific populations (e.g., humans), the limitations of existing experimental technologies, and the challenge of coordinating large numbers of experiments with multiple levels of data [2] . One approach to shed light on these dynamics is to pair complementary datasets from the same individuals and perform statistical mediation analysis (e.g., [3] [4] [5] ), which has increasingly been used in genomics [6] . These analyses can identify putative causal relationships rather than correlational interactions, providing meaningful and actionable targets in terms of downstream applications in areas such as medicine and agriculture.",

Towards this end, geneticallydiverse mouse population resources have been established, including the Collaborative Cross (CC) [17] [18] [19] and the Diversity Outbred (DO) population [20] . The CC and the DO are multiparental populations (MPP), derived from the same eight founder strains (short names in parentheses): A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/H1LtJ (NZO), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). The CC are recombinant inbred strains and therefore replicable across and within studies; the DO are largely heterozygous, outbred animals, bred with a random mating strategy that seeks to maximize diversity. MPPs similar to the CC or DO have also been developed in other species, including rats, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and yeast, and the use of MPPs in model organism research has accelerated significantly in recent years ( [21] and refs therein).",

CC mice were then used to confirm results by showing correspondence with estimates of founder haplotype effects from each of the related populations. More recently, mediation analysis was used to connect chromatin accessibility with gene expression in embryonic stem cells derived from DO mice [23] . The CC and DO, and MPPs more broadly, have well-characterized haplotype structures that provide a unique opportunity for studying mediation at the haplotype level. This is potentially advantageous because haplotypes can capture genetic variation and its effects more comprehensively than can individual SNPs [24] , the latter being the predominant basis for comparable mediation analyses in humans.",

This was borne out by principal components analysis (PCA) of each of the gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles, which showed that the samples clearly clustered by tissue (S1 Fig). Differentially expressed genes strongly correspond with accessible chromatin regions. Differential expression (DE) and differentially accessible region (DAR) analysis were performed between the three tissues (S1 Table) and revealed between 3,564-5,709 DE genes and 28,048-40,797 DARs (FDR \ufffd 0.1). For both expression and chromatin accessibility, liver and kidney tissues were the most similar, whereas lung and liver were the most distinct, also seen in the PCA plots (S1 Fig). Pathway analyses showed many between-tissue differences related to metabolic and immune-related pathways (FDR \ufffd 0.1), reflecting the distinct demands of each tissue. Energy metabolism pathways were more active in liver and kidney and immune-related pathways were more pronounced in lung, as expected. We compared the concordance between DE genes and DARs genome-wide and observed that most DE gene promoters do not show significant differences in chromatin accessibility (S2 Fig). In cases with significant variability in accessibility at the promoter of a DE gene, though, the vast majority agree in direction (i.e., higher expression with greater accessibility).",

The local-eQTL consistently drove higher expression when the CAST haplotype was present, intermediate expression with 129, NOD, and NZO haplotypes, and lower expression with AJ, B6, PWK, and WSB haplotypes. Though the haplotype effects on relative expression levels within each tissue were consistent, we noted that the expression level was significantly higher in liver compared with both lung (q = 5.41 \u00d7 10 \u221218 ) and kidney (q = 6.25 \u00d7 10 \u221219 ). Ubiquitin C (Ubc) is another example of a gene with consistent local-eQTL detected in all three tissues (S12 Fig). Slc44a3 and Pik3c2g: Tissue-specific haplotype effects for local-eQTL. We found instances where haplotype effects across the three tissues were inconsistent, referring to these as tissue-specific effects (within this subset of tissues). The strongest support of tissue-specificity would be given by QTL pairs whose effects are uncorrelated. For example, the solute carrier family 44, member 3 (Slc44a3) gene has local-eQTL effects that are correlated in lung and kidney but anticorrelated in liver (Fig 3B) , suggesting the liver eQTL could be transgressive [28] relative to the eQTL in lung and kidney, whereby the effects of the haplotypes are reversed. For Slc44a3, CAST, PWK, and WSB haplotypes result in higher expression in liver but lower expression in lung and kidney. The local-eQTL for Slc44a3 were more similar in location in lung and kidney whereas the liver eQTL was more distal to the gene TSS. Overall, the expression data, estimated effects, and patterns of association are consistent with lung and kidney sharing a causal local-eQTL that is distinct from the one in liver.",

The local-eQTL in all three tissues were all pair-wise uncorrelated (Fig 4) . Further, expression of Pik3c2g varied at statistically significant levels for liver versus lung (q = 3.12 \u00d7 10 \u221213 ) and lung versus kidney (q = 3.55 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). In lung, the CAST haplotype (cast subspecies lineage) resulted in higher expression, consistent with a cast versus dom/mus allelic series. In kidney, the B6, 129, NZO, Local-eQTL for Pik3c2g were detected in all three tissues in the 3Mb region surrounding its TSS. The genomes of the CC founders can be simplified in terms of contributions from three subspecies lineages of M. musculus: dom (blue), cast (yellow), and mus (red).

The PWK founder appears inconsistent, but we note that the QTL peak was in a small dom haplotype block interspersed within a broader mus region. The expression level in kidney of Pik3c2g in PWK was low, similar to AJ and NOD, suggesting that the causal variant may be located in the nearby region, where all three have mus inheritance and, notably, where the peak variant association occurred. In liver, the B6 haplotype resulted in lower expression compared with the other haplotypes. Interestingly, the liver eQTL was in a region that contained a recombination event between dom and mus, only present in B6, which may explain the unique expression pattern.",

Haplotype effects that correlate across tissues can provide additional evidence for distal-QTL, even those with marginal significance in any single tissue. For example, the aldo-keto reductase family 1, member E1 (Akr1e1; Fig 5A) gene is located on chromosome 13 with no local-eQTL detected in any tissue. Distal-eQTL in all tissues were detected for Akr1e1 that localized to the same region on chromosome 4. The haplotype effects of the distal-eQTL were all highly correlated, Per2 has intra-chromosomal distal-eQTL leniently detected 100Mb away from the TSS, also with highly correlated haplotype effects across the tissues, providing further support that the distal-eQTL are not false positives. Expression data are represented as interquartile ranges for most likely diplotype, with differential expression noted when significant. Haplotype associations for each tissue distal-eQTL combination are shown, with the most rigorous statistical procedure for detection reported (Analysis L, C, or G). Red ticks signify the gene TSS and black ticks represent that eQTL peak. Fit haplotype effects, estimated as BLUPs, are included, along with the pairwise correlations of the eQTL. with AJ, B6, 129, and CAST haplotypes corresponding to higher Akr1e1 expression. Across tissues, expression was significantly higher in liver and kidney compared with lung (q = 1.63 \u00d7 10 \u221219 and q = 4.40 \u00d7 10 \u221234 , respectively). Another example is the Period circadian clock 2 (Per2; Fig 5B) gene, which possessed intra-chromosomal distal-eQTL approximately 100Mb away from the TSS that were detected in all three tissues at a lenient chromosomewide significance (Analysis C; FDR \ufffd 0.2). The haplotype effects were significantly correlated among the tissues, characterized by high expression with the NOD and PWK haplotypes present. Together, these findings provide strong validation for the distal-eQTL, which would commonly not be detected based on tissue-stratified analyses. Other unique patterns of distal genetic regulation were detected, such as for ring finger protein 13 gene (Rnf13) with distal-eQTL that varied across tissues, described in S13 Fig. ",

In the first model, proximal chromatin state acts as a mediator of local-eQTL ( Fig 6A) . That is, the local-eQTL for a gene affects that gene's expression by, at least in part, altering local chromatin accessibility.

It was previously postulated that Akr1e1 is distally regulated by the reduced expression 2 (Rex2) gene, also a ZFP that contains a KRAB domain and resides in the same region of chromosome 4 [37] . Our distal-eQTL overlap their Idd9.2 regulatory region, defined as spanning 145.5-148.57Mb, mapped with NOD mice congenic with C57BL/10 (B10) [35] . The B10 haplotype was found to be protective against development of diabetes, characteristic of NOD mice. AKR1e1 is involved in glycogen metabolism and the Idd9 region harbors immune-related genes, suggesting genes regulated by elements in the Idd9 region may be diabetes-related. Consistent with these studies, CC strains with NOD inheritance at the distal-eQTL had low expression of Akr1e1, observed in all tissues. Genetic variation from B10 is not present in the CC, but the closely related B6 founder had high expression of Akr1e1 like B10. NZO, PWK, and WSB haplotypes resulted in low Akr1e1 expression, similar to NOD, while AJ, 129, and CAST haplotypes joined B6 as driving high expression (Fig 9) . Variable expression of Zfp985 is a strong candidate for driving these effects on Akr1e1.",

We detected extensive evidence of chromatin mediation of local-eQTL as well as gene expression mediators underlying distal-eQTL. One unique example is the elucidation of the genetic regulation of Akr1e1 expression, a gene that plays a role in glycogen metabolism, involving inhibition by expression of a distal zinc finger protein mediator that contributes to reduced chromatin accessibility at the promoter of Akr1e1.

The reduced number of cQTL compared with eQTL is likely due to both technical and biological reasons. Technically, the RNA-seq assay measures a distinct class of molecules (mRNAs) that can be accurately extracted from cells with the resulting sequence reads mapped to the transcriptome, which encompasses < 5% of the genome. In contrast, the transposon incorporation event central to ATAC-seq is enriched in, but not solely limited to, accessible chromatin. Unlike the transcriptome, accessible chromatin can occur anywhere in the genome and regions are defined empirically by the data. Thus, the signal from the assay is more variable and noisy across samples, which impedes our ability to detect cQTL. Biologically, if a variant affects the activity of a regulatory element that alters expression levels, it is expected that the mRNA levels in the sample will reflect this. By contrast, even if a variant affects chromatin accessibility, it may do so in a manner that is difficult to detect above the background noise of the assay. In recent studies of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the adult brain from the same individuals, 2,154,331 cis-eQTL were found for 467 individuals [38] , whereas only 6,200 cQTL were detected, albeit for only 272 individuals [39] . While the reduced number of individuals undoubtedly contributed to The genetic regulation of Akr1e1 expression is reconstructed based on relationships observed across the three tissues. Distal-eQTL were detected in all tissues at similar levels of significance. A local-eQTL for Zfp985 that is proximal to the Akr1e1 distal-eQTL was observed in lung, and Zfp985 expression was detected as an anti-correlated mediator of the distal-eQTL, consistent with ZFP985 suppressing Akr1e1 expression. The chromatin site proximal to the Akr1e1 TSS has a distal-cQTL detected in kidney. Chromatin accessibility at the site was found to be a significant mediator of Akr1e1 expression. Combining associations across tissues supports a biological model whereby ZFP985, whose gene is expressed in mice with NOD, NZO, PWK, and WSB haplotypes, silences Akr1e1 through KRAB domain-induced chromatin remodeling. QTL and mediation genome scans are included, along with sequence phenotypes as interquartile ranges categorized according to most likely diplotype, and modeled haplotype effects fit as BLUPs. The relative magnitudes of the QTL effect sizes and mediation scores are consistent with the proposed model, with Zfp985 local-eQTL > distal-cQTL > Akr1e1 distal-eQTL, and chromatin mediation > mediation through Zfp985 expression.",

We believe our use of formal statistical tests of the correlation coefficient between the haplotype effects of overlapping QTL is novel in defining co-localizing QTL across tissues. This method allows us to identify loci likely representing tissue-specific QTL with unique haplotype effects patterns, as demonstrated for the gene Pik3c2g (Fig 4) . This approach can also detect consistent haplotype effects, as with the gene Per2 (Fig 5B) , which possessed only marginally significant distal-eQTL in the three tissues, suggesting jointly mapping QTL across all tissues increases power. Formal joint analysis approaches have been proposed, largely implemented for detecting SNP associations, including meta-analysis on summary statistics (e.g., [43, 44] ) and fully joint analysis, including Bayesian hierarchical models [45] and mixed models [46] . Extending such methods to haplotypebased analysis in MPPs poses some challenges, including how to best generalize methods to more complex genetic models and for the CC with a limited number of unique genomes. Nonetheless, when multiple levels of molecular traits are measured, joint analyses could conceivably be incorporated into the mediation framework to improve detection power.",

It may be that these genes are primarily expressed in a common cell type whose proportion varies between the different tissue types, and that the observed differential expression reflects this compositional variation.

Our mediation analysis approach is adapted from previous studies in DO mice [22, 23, 33] but adds the use of QTL effect sizes to establish consistency with the directionality of the relationships and the formal calculation of an empirical mediation p-value through permutation. Related conditional regression approaches were used in the incipient pre-CC lines [47, 48] . Mediation results largely reflect the correlations between the variables after adjusting for additional sources of variation, such as covariates and batch effects. We further require the mediator QTL to have a larger effect size than the outcome QTL in order to identify trios that are consistent with the proposed causal models. It must be emphasized, however, that these steps are not equivalent to experimentally controlling the directionality of the relationship between a gene's expression level and a putative mediator, nor is such control feasible in a large-scale experiment. Variable measurement error on the mediator and gene could flip the perceived directionality of the relationship, resulting in both false positive and negative mediations. Alternatively, the relationships could be more complex than the simple models used here, e.g. feedback between the mediator and gene, which these procedures will not detect. Additionally, the causal mediator may not be observed in the data, allowing for other candidates, correlated with the missing causal element, to be incorrectly identified as mediators.",

For example, we show strong evidence for ZFP985 mediating the genetic regulation of Akr1e1 (Fig 9) . Additional evidence suggests this is done by ZFP985 contributing to reduced Akr1e1 promoter activity. It is possible that Zfp985 expression is simply strongly correlated with the true mediator, and others have alternatively proposed Rex2 expression as a candidate [35] , which we did not consider due to low expression in all three tissues. Regardless of the identity of the true mediator, our analysis shows strong evidence that it acts causally by reducing chromatin accessibility near Akr1e1.",

Our intent is to capture QTL that likely act in cis on gene expression and chromatin accessibility, which are expected to have strong effects, while also recognizing the limitations of using haplotype blocks with median size of 16.3 Mb [19] and a small sample size. S6 Fig sug- gest that 10Mb generally captures the strongest QTL signals near the gene TSS and chromatin window midpoint. The second protocol, Analysis C, broadened the search for QTL to anywhere on the chromosome on which the trait is located; the greater number of loci considered meant that the criterion used to call detected QTL for this protocol was more stringent than Analysis L. The third protocol, Analysis G, further broadened the search to the entire genome with the most stringent detection criterion. These protocols used two types of multiple test correction: a permutation-based control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR; [62] ).

We instead determine a null distribution explicitly by permutation, characterizing the distribution of the minimum logP (as opposed to maximum logP for QTL scans) to estimate significance and set false positive control (FWER). As with the QTL mapping procedures, we performed mediation scans on 1,000 permutations, permuting the mediators rather than the outcome, to characterize GEVs from the minimum logP, that is, permP m = F GEV (logP), at both chromosome-and genome-wide levels.",

Many of these cannot be controlled in a system as complex as chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in whole living organisms. Nevertheless, signals in the data that are consistent with the mediation model represent candidate causal factors that regulate gene expression. Though it is impossible to ensure that the direction of causation is indeed M ! Y, as assumed by the mediation analysis, we require additional checks to formally declare mediation of an eQTL. The presence of the relationship X ! Y is already established in that mediation scans are only performed for detected eQTL. In addition for any candidate mediator with a significant permP m , we require detection of a mediator QTL: X ! M. These requirements, as mentioned earlier, are consistent with traditional mediation analysis. Finally, in an attempt to identify mediatorto-gene relationships consistent with the proposed models, we require that X ! M is more significant than X ! Y. Though this step cannot confirm the directionality of the relationship between M and Y, as variable noise level between M and Y could reduce the estimated effect size of their respective QTL, it will identify candidate mediators that are consistent with the proposed models. Further details on the mediation analysis are described in S3 Appendix, including the permutation approach and the formal criterion by which mediation is declared for both chromatin and gene mediators (Fig 6) .",

The R package miQTL was used for all the mapping and mediation analyses, and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/gkeele/miqtl and a fixed version as S8 File. There was an excess of significant positively correlated haplotype effects in QTL pairs across tissues for gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Pairs of QTL observed in multiple tissues were defined for local-eQTL (left column), distal-eQTL (middle column), and local-cQTL (right column). Only four pairs of distal-cQTL were observed, all shared between lung and kidney. A right-tailed test the correlation between haplotype effects (H A : r > 0) was performed for each QTL pair, producing p-values that were then FDR adjusted. Null simulations of uncorrelated 8-element vector pairs for each class of QTL and pairwise tissue comparison emphasize the observed enrichment in correlated haplotype effects between QTL pairs. (TIF) S11 Fig. Cross -tissue QTL pairs with highly correlated haplotype effects map proximally to each other. Haplotype effects were estimated as constrained BLUPs. Pairwise correlations of the 8-element effect vectors were calculated for QTL pairs, and plotted again the distance between the QTL coordinates in Mb for (liver/lung) in the left column, (liver/kidney) in the middle column, and (lung/kidney) in the right column. Single eQTL and cQTL pairs are represented as a yellow and blue dots, respectively. Local-eQTL are shown in the top row, distal-eQTL in the second row, local-cQTL in the third row, and distal c-QTL in the bottom row, for which only four pairs were detected in (lung/kidney). (TIF) S12 Fig. The gene Ubc has consistent strong local-eQTL observed in the three tissues. The local-eQTL consistently drove higher expression when the B6, NOD, NZO, and WSB haploytpes were present. Expression levels in liver and lung were found to be significantly different (q = 0.022). The estimated haplotype effects were highly consistent with the expression data, represented as interquartile bars categorized by most likely diplotype. The haplotype and variant associations in the eQTL regions were similar across tissues, suggesting they may represent the same causal origin. The red tick represents the Ubc TSS, the black tick represents the peak variant association, and the colored ticks represent the peak haplotype association for each tissue. (TIF) S13 Fig. The gene Rnf13 has unique patterns of genetic regulation across tissues. A strong local-eQTL was detected in liver, and after conditioning on it, a statistically significant distal-eQTL was detected (Analysis G) on chromosome 12, largely driven by the B6 haplotype, distinct from the local-eQTL. The unique haplotype effect patterns for each eQTL can be seen in both the expression data, represented by interquartile bars for most likely diplotype, and the estimated effects. The red tick marks the Rnf13 TSS and the black tick marks the location of distal-eQTL. Another strong distal-eQTL was detected on the X chromosome in lung. (TIF) S14 Fig. Co -localizing eQTL and cQTL are not sufficient for statistical mediation. The approach used to detect mediation through chromatin accessibility requires that the eQTL and cQTL co-localize (both within 10Mb of the gene TSS), as well as possess similar haplotype effect patterns. Co-localizing cQTL are observed for local-eQTL for both (A) Hdhd3 in liver and (B) Acbd4 in kidney. QTL and mediation scans are shown, with chromosomes 4 and 11 blown up for Hdhd3 and Acbd4, respectively. The red ticks denote the TSS for both genes. The haplotype effects for the eQTL and cQTL are highly correlated (r = 0.96) for Hdhd3, but not for Acbd4 (r = 0.55). Strong mediation of the Hdhd3 eQTL through chromatin is detected, but not for Acbd4. The effect size of the co-localizing cQTL to Acbd4 is smaller than its eQTL, also inconsistent with the relationship depicted in Fig 6A. (TIF) S15 Fig. Mediation of Ccnyl1 distal-eQTL through Zfp979 expression. Expression of Ccnyl1 and Zfp979 are correlated (r = 0.72) in lung, which is also observed in the expression data categorized by diplotype and the haplotype effects. The distal-eQTL on chromosome 4 for Ccnyl1 corresponds closely to local-eQTL of Zfp979. Ccnyl1 is located on chromosome 1, indicated by the red tick. Zfp979 and Zfp985, both zinc finger proteins likely with DNA binding properties, are identified as strong candidate mediators of the distal-eQTL at genome-wide significance. The correlations, magnitude of effects, and mediation are consistent with the simple relationship depicted in the graph. The distal-eQTL and candidate mediators are located in a region of interest that regulates Akr1e1 expression. (TIF) S16 Fig. Mediation of Akr1e1 distal-eQTL through Zfp985 expression. Expression of Akr1e1 and Zfp985 are anti-correlated (r = \u22120.69) in lung. This relationship is also observed in the expression data with bars representing the interquartile range, categorized by most likely diplotype, and the haplotype effects. The QTL and mediation scans reveal that Akr1e1, with TSS marked with a red tick on chromosome 13, possesses a distal-eQTL on chromosome 4 that is nearby the strong local-eQTL of Zfp985. The mediation scan identifies Zfp985 as a strong candidate mediator consistent with the mediation model. A more complete picture of the genetic regulation of Akr1e1 expression is pieced together by looking across all three tissues and includes a potential chromatin mediator (Fig 9) . (TIF) S17 Fig. Confirmation of Akr1e1 distal-eQTL and mediation by Zfp985 in kidney tissue of Diversity Outbred mice. A genome-wide significant distal-eQTL was detected for Akr1e1 in liver, lung (shown here), and kidney tissues from 47 CC strains. In a larger sample of kidney tissue from outbred DO mice, the same distal-eQTL and mediation relationship were observed. As expected, the larger sample of the DO results in greater statistical significance, and confirms that the NOD effect is more strongly negative than NZO, PWK, and WSB, which the haplotype effects plots for the Zfp985 local-eQTL suggested. Notably, Zfp985 was not tested in the CC kidney because of low expression levels, though the distal-eQTL for Akr1e1 is consistent with its activity, which is here confirmed in the DO. Based on ranking mapping analyses with respect to the extent of scope, local (L; magenta) to chromosome (C; plum) to genomewide (G; cyan), the greater the scope corresponded to reduced power to detect QTL, shown in liver, lung, and kidney tissues for gene expression (yellow line) and chromatin accessibility (blue line). Each dot represents a detected local-QTL, colored according to the highest scope mapping procedure that detected it. The three horizontal bars represent the 25 th , 50 th , and 75 th quantiles of QTL effect sizes for all local-QTL per tissue. Analysis G generally detects QTL with effect size > 60%, whereas Analyses C and L detect QTL effect sizes > 45%. Effect size estimates correspond to a fixed effects model of the QTL. The multistage conditional regression approach of Analysis G allows for the detection of multiple genome-wide significant QTL, which can be appropriately incorporated into an FDR procedure across many outcomes. In this example in lung tissue, the gene Gpn3 initially has a strong distal-eQTL on chromosome 8 [top left]. Though a peak is detected near the TSS of Gpn3, it does not meet genome-wide significance. However, after conditioning on the distal-eQTL, the local-eQTL is detected [bottom left]. Horizontal dashed lines represent empirical 95% significance thresholds based on 1,000 permutations.

(TIF) S3 Fig. Overlap across tissues of (A) genes and (B) chromatin windows used for QTL analysis.Sequence traits were filtered to remove outcomes more likely to cause spurious QTL signals. Genes with TPM \ufffd 1 and chromatin windows with TMP \ufffd 5 for \ufffd 50% of samples were removed from analysis. After this filtering process, lung had the greatest number of traits analyzed, for both genes and chromatin windows, followed by kidney and then liver.(TIF) S4 Fig. Overlap across tissues of (A) genes and (B) chromatin windows with local-QTL detected. The majority of sequence traits with a local-QTL detected were identified in only a single tissue. Kidney had the highest number of local-eQTL, whereas lung had the highest number of local-cQTL. Liver had a relative lack of local-cQTL, which may relate to its having the fewest chromatin windows analyzed (S3B Fig). Results included local-QTL detected with Analysis G (FDR \ufffd 0.1), Analysis C (FDR \ufffd 0.1), and Analysis L (genome-wide and chromosome-wide). (TIF) S5 Fig. QTL mapping results using only Analysis G or Analysis C. QTL map plots of (A) eQTL and (B) cQTL with FDR controlled at 0.1 and 0.2 for liver, lung, and kidney. Detected QTL from Analysis G (multi-stage FDR) and Analysis C (chromosome-wide FDR) are included. Analysis C, which uses FDR control for chromosome-wide significant QTL, produces a large number of intra-chromosomal distal-QTL. The y-axis represents the genomic position of the gene or chromatin site, and the x-axis represents the genomic position of the QTL. Local-QTL appear as dots along the diagonal.

The permutation-based p-value (permP) from (A) Analysis G and (B) Analysis C for eQTL and cQTL by their distance (Mb) from the gene TSS and the midpoint of the chromatin site. Inter-chromosomal distal-QTL are not included. The red dashed lines represent \u00b110Mb of the gene TSS or the midpoint of the chromatin site for classifying QTL as local or distal. Significant signals (yellow or blue), based on FDR \ufffd 0.1, are largely local. Analysis C detects many more intra-chromosomal distal-QTL. (TIF) S7 Fig. QTL effect size by local/distal status. Each dot represents a QTL detected through either (A) Analysis G or (B) Analysis C with FDR \ufffd 0.1. The three horizontal bars represent the 25 th , 50 th , and 75 th quantiles of QTL effect sizes for all local-QTL per tissue. More local-eQTL are detected and have higher effects than distal-QTL. Analysis C detects a large number of intra-chromosomal distal-QTL that Analysis G does not, many of which have low effect sizes. Effect size estimates are based on a fixed effects model. (TIF) S8 Fig. CAST and PWK haploytpes have more extreme effects for (A) eQTL and (B) cQTL compared with the other strains. Haplotype effects were estimated as BLUPs, which are constrained and centered around 0. Each QTL is represented by an 8-element effect vector. Founders with more extreme effects are identified by comparing the absolute values of effects. Founder haploytpe effect trends for eQTL are similar to cQTL. The trends are unstable in distal-cQTL because so few are identified. (TIF) S9 Fig. Effect sizes between cross-tissue QTL pairs are lowly but significantly correlated.
