We show that protein VI, an internal capsid protein, is rapidly exposed after cell surface attachment and internalization and remains partially associated with the capsid during intracellular transport. We found that a PPxY motif within protein VI recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to bind and ubiquitylate protein VI. We further show that this PPxY motif is involved in rapid, microtubule-dependent intracellular movement of protein VI. Ads with a mutated PPxY motif can efficiently escape endosomes but are defective in microtubule-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus. Likewise, depletion of Nedd4 ligases attenuates nuclear accumulation of incoming Ad particles and infection. Our data provide the first evidence that virus-encoded PPxY motifs are required during virus entry, which may be of significance for several other pathogens.",

            "text": "Many viruses use the microtubule network of the host cell for transport to their site of replication (i.e. the nucleus) [1] . Access to the microtubule network is achieved through recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein motor proteins followed by efficient retrograde transport towards the nucleus [2, 3] . Virus-induced cellular signaling cascades help stimulate the directionality and efficacy of the transport [4] . Viral interaction with dynein motor proteins occurs either directly through capsid proteins or indirectly via hijacking of adapters from existing transport pathways [5] . Most DNA viruses accumulate transiently at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) prior to nuclear translocation [1, 3, 6] . How they release from the microtubules or the MTOC and transport to nuclear pores is poorly understood. MTOC release may involve a switch from dynein to kinesin mediated transport, the cellular ubiquitin/ proteasome system and/or nuclear transport receptors [1, 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

For example, translocation of a murine coronavirus from the endosome to the cytoplasm is facilitated by the ubiquitinproteasome system [9] . Similarly, influenza viruses appear to be trapped in an endosomal compartment upon pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome [10] . In contrast, blocking the proteasome increases the transduction efficiency of adenoassociated virus vectors and this correlates with ubiquitylation of capsid proteins [11, 12] . The Semliki forest and the vesicular stomatitis virus, however, do not seem to be affected by proteasome inhibition during their entry suggesting different host factor requirements [10] .",

Egress involves the transport of assembled capsids, subviral structures or individual capsid proteins to assembly and budding sites at the cell surface or at intracellular membranes [1] . Budding, and potentially trafficking, to the egress site requires an intact class E vesicular sorting pathway (VSP, [13, 14] . The VSP is believed to involve the consecutive activity of three distinct heteromeric complexes termed endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-I, -II and -III, [15] ). The capsid proteins of several enveloped viruses encode 'late domains' that specifically interact with ESCRT components and redirect them towards the site of viral egress [13] . Some late domains of the PPxY motif type (where x can be any amino acid) require the binding of ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family of HECT-E3 ubiquitin ligases (Homologous to E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) for efficient ESCRT recruitment [13] .",

We demonstrate that the internal capsid protein VI is rapidly exposed to antibodies during cell entry, possibly at the cell surface or immediately after endocytosis. We further determine that protein VI remains partially associated with Ad capsids as they traffic to MTOCs and the NPC. We identify a functional PPxY motif within protein VI that mediates the association of protein VI with Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and facilitates its ubiquitylation. Recombinant Ad5 in which the protein VI PPxY motif is mutated have normal capsid morphology, escape from endosomes with similar efficiency as wildtype viruses, but are defective in genome delivery to the nucleus. We show that the PPxY motif in protein VI is involved in its efficient microtubule-mediated transport and mutating it in the virus alters the intracellular targeting of Ads towards the MTOC region concomitant with a post-entry block in viral infectivity. Furthermore, Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 are involved in Ad infection and intracellular targeting of incoming virions to the MTOC. We propose that the PPxY motif, in other viral systems, may also function during entry and interact with novel cellular pathways for efficient viral entry.",

To this end, fluorescently labeled Ad particles were adsorbed to either human retina epithelia pigment cells (hTERT-RPE1, Figure 1 ) or human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS, Figure S1 ) at 4uC and then transferred to 37uC to synchronize internalization. Cells were fixed at various times and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1 ). Protein VI was detected using an affinity purified polyclonalantiserum and the location of the MTOC was marked by detecting the primary cilia, which originates at the MTOC using antibodies against acetylated tubulin [32] . At 4uC viral particles accumulated at the cell periphery showing sporadic positive staining with the protein VI antiserum (,1%) possibly due to the recognition of protein VI from damaged particles (Figure 1 first row). In contrast, 5 min after the temperature shift, Ad particles were still localized close to the cell periphery but approximately 40% of them gave a signal with the protein VI antibody indicating that more protein VI was accessible ( Figure 1 , second row). After 15 min, particles had entered the cell with some localized at the MTOC region ( Figure 1 , third row) and some at the nuclear rim as described previously [6] . About 10% of the particles remained protein VI positive, including particles at the nuclear rim. After 45 min the majority of the particles were concentrated at the MTOC region ( Figure 1 , bottom row) as previously reported [3] . Protein VI staining was also concentrated at the MTOC region but most of the signal was not particle associated. Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells ( Figure S1 ). Together these data suggested that structural rearrangements leading to protein VI exposure take place at or close to the cell surface during Ad entry. In addition, the data showed that protein VI trafficked to the MTOC region and partially remained associated with the capsid.",

To redirect cellular functions for their own purpose, viruses encode high-affinity binding sites for key-cellular factors. One such domain is the PPxY motif, which is present in structural proteins of several, mainly enveloped viruses. This motif binds to ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family and recruits their function to sites of virus budding from cells. Here we show that adenoviruses also encode a PPxY motif in the internal structural protein VI and that the PPxY motif has an unprecedented function in virus entry. Adenoviruses with mutations in the protein VI PPxY motif undergo normal endosomal uptake and membrane penetration but have reduced infectivity, altered intracellular targeting and lack efficient gene-delivery. We also find that protein VI is ubiquitylated by Nedd4 ligases in a PPxY dependent manner following partial capsid disassembly and displays rapid intracellular movement. Depletion of Nedd4 ligases also alters virus movement within cells during entry and reduces viral infectivity. Given that PPxY motifs are important for virus exit our findings might have uncovered an additional function for PPxY motifs in virus entry, potentially expanding the significance of PPxY motifs and functionally related domains for viral replication.",

In large-scale preparations, mutant and wt virus banded at identical densities and gave similar yields of particles as determined by genome and protein quantification.

We observed a reduction in infectivity in the same order of magnitude as previously (compare Figures 2C with 2E and 2D with 2F). In addition the GFP expression allowed us to follow the plaque formation over time. As shown in Figure S4 the spread of the M1 mutant virus was significantly slower and led to fewer and much smaller plaques ( Figure 2E and Figure S4 ).",

We infected A549 cells with 30, 300 or 3000 particles per cell of either Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1 in the presence of alpha-sarcin, a membrane impermeable toxin that inhibits translation when it enters the cytoplasm. Alpha-sarcin enters the cell by virus-mediated endosomal membrane lysis thus providing a quantifiable marker for endsome membrane lysis ( Figure 2G , [28] ). We measured the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids over time as a means to determine translational efficiency. As control we used the temperature sensitive Ad mutant Ad2ts1 that is closely related to Ad5. Ad2ts1 mutants poorly lyse the endosomal membrane when the virus is grown at non-permissive temperatures due to an increased capsid stability that lacks intraendosomal disassembly. Ad2ts1 mutants grown at permissive temperatures lyse the endosome with the same efficiency as the wt virus. Incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids was compared to alpha-sarcin treated cells. When we added alpha-Sarcin and Ad5-VI-wt, Ad5-VI-M1 or the Ad2ts1 mutant grown at a permissive temperature translation was diminished in a dosedependent manner over at least two orders of magnitude, showing efficient cytoplasmic delivery of the toxin. Ad2ts1 grown at the non-permissive temperature did not inhibit translation in this assay ( Figure 2G ). We observed no difference between the PPxY-mutant virus and the wt controls. This indicated that an attenuating effect of the PPxY-mutation occurs after endosomal lysis and prior to the onset of replication.",

Ad5-VI-wt released protein VI within 5 min ( Figure 3A , left panel). In contrast, we observed a delayed release of protein VI from Ad5-VI-M1 (15% of M1 after 5 min compared to 38% of wt, Figure 3A ) and an increase in colocalization of viral particles with protein VI at the nucleus ( Figure 3A ). This observation suggests a delayed accessibility of protein VI within the virus or a defect in protein VI dissociation from the virion ( Figure 3A , images to the right). In addition to the increase of protein VI capsid association, Ad5-VI-M1 appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the cell and did not efficiently accumulate at the MTOC region ( Figure 3B , images to the left). Quantification revealed that 45 min post-infection approximately 60% of the wt viral particles in proximity of the MTOC could be found within a 10 mm radius around the MTOC and 40% within 10-20 mm. In contrast, the localization for the M1 virus was 50% for each region showing a decreased targeting towards the MTOC ( Figure 3B , right panel). In summary these data suggest that the PPxY motif in protein VI is required for proper uncoating and normal nuclear targeting.",

We found VI-wt in a punctuated distribution throughout the cell suggesting association with a vesicular compartment or tubulo-vesicular structures associated with microtubules ( Figure 4 , top row). In contrast, the PPxY motif mutant VI-M1 localized to a more central compartment and was rarely associated with the microtubules (Figure 4 , middle row). Deletion of the amphipathic helix, in contrast, abrogated purified Ad capsids. Electronic microscopy images of purified Ad5-VI-wt capsids (left panel) and purified Ad5-VI-M1 (right panel) are shown. The inset in each figure shows a magnification of individual capsids. The scale bar is 100nm. C) Plaque assay comparison of Ad5-VI-wt vs. Ad5-VI-M1. Quantification of plaques at day 12 for different physical particle per cell ratios for Ad5-VI-wt and Ad5-VI-M1. Shown is the average plaque number per 6 well (+/2 standard deviation) of three individual experiments. D) Focus forming assay. E1 complementing 911 cells were infected with Ad5-VIwt or Ad5-VI-M1 and replication centers were stained with E2A antibodies 24 h post-infection and at different particle per cell ratios. .5 random fields with .200 cells were counted, standard deviation represents field-to-field variations. E) Plaque forming assay comparison of Ad5GFP-VI-wt vs. Ad5GFP-VI-M1. Quantification of GFP positive plaques at day 12 at different physical particle to cell ratios. The values show the average number of GFP positive plaques per 6-well (+/2 standard deviation) of two independent experiments. F) Single round infection assay comparison of Ad5GFP-VIwt vs. Ad5GFP-VI-M1. U2OS cells were infected with increasing amounts of physical particle to cell ratios as indicated. GFP expression was quantified using FACS. Values correspond to the average percentage of GFP positive cells of two experiments done in triplicates (+/2 standard deviation). Note that the ,100% infection of wt infected cells at 100 physical particles per cell is saturated and not comparable to M1. G) Analysis of membrane penetration. A549 cells were infected with Ad5-VI-wt, Ad5-VI-M1, Ad2ts1 grown at 32uC or at 38uC at different physical particle per cell ratios as indicated and in the presence of alpha-Sarcin and translational efficiency was determined by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids over time. Values are given in percentage normalized to 100% translation measured in the presence of the toxin but in absence of virus. Conditions are indicated below each bar and are the mean of at least three independent experiments done in triplicates. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000808.g002 Owing to its association with membranes, microtubules and the viral capsid, we next asked whether protein VI displayed intracellular dynamics that could explain virus trafficking. We therefore performed live-cell imaging (LCI) using cells expressing mRFP-VI-wt or mRFP-VI-M1. We found that VI-wt was fast moving with short-and longrange movements whereas VI-M1 was essentially motionless ( Figure 5A and Video S1). The length of the trajectories and the movement of .300 particles were plotted ( Figure 5B ). We found that protein VI-M1 motility was greatly reduced compared to protein VI-wt. We next asked whether VI-wt motility depends on intact microtubules and/or actin filaments. Disrupting actin filaments with cytochalasin B had no apparent effect on VI-wt localization or motility ( Figure 5B , right panel) suggesting that actin was not involved in the movement. In contrast, protein VI motility in nocodazole-treated cells was strongly reduced resembling the reduced motion observed for the M1 mutant ( Figure 5B , right panel, see also Video S2 in the supporting information).",

We only detected ubiquitylation of the penton base (which also harbors two PPxY domains at its N-terminus), while the fiber and protein IIIA (which lack PPxY motifs) were not modified ( Figure S5 ).

We detected protein VI-reactive bands, consistent with protein VI modified with two to three ubiquitin ( Figure 6B , lane 2). In contrast, no modification was observed when the PPxY motif was mutated ( Figure 6B , lane 1) or in the absence of ATP ( Figure 6B, lane 3 and 4) . Using viral particles in in vitro ubiquitylation reactions (following partial capsid disassembly) protein VI of Ad5-VI-M1 was not ubiquitylated ( Figure 6C , Figure 5 . Subcellular dynamics of protein VI. A) U2OS cells were transfected with VI-wt (top row) or VI-M1 (bottom row) fused to mRFP and analyzed by live-cell imaging. Frames were taken at 1 sec intervals using a Cascade 512B 2 camera. The left image in all rows shows maximum image projections of the full frame depicting the cell with scale bar of 10 mm. The four inverted images to the right show magnifications from the boxed inset of four consecutive frames (in the case of VI-wt) and every fifths frame (in the case of VI-M1). In the top panel a moving particle is depicted by a grey arrow within each frame using the departure point depicted by a white arrow as reference. The lower panel shows VI-M1 not moving. B) Analysis of trajectory length and relative particle speed of VI-wt or VI-M1 (left side of both panels) or trajectory length and relative particle speed of VI-wt using drugs as indicated (right side of both panels). Movies were processed and all recorded trajectories were analyzed for length and relative speed using the Imaris TM software package. Individual particles were plotted for length of trajectories (in mm, left panel) and the net movement (in mm/ 20sec, right panel) under the conditions tested (indicated below each chart). Significant differences are indicated by bars. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000808.g005 lane 3 and 4), while protein VI from Ad5-VI-wt was ( Figure 6C , lane 1 and 2). Thus, the PPxY motif in protein VI is inaccessible in intact capsids but can recruit ubiquitin ligase activity from cytosol when protein VI is released from the capsid interior. Together our results show that protein VI ubiquitylation depends on i) virus disassembly, ii) an intact PPxY domain and iii) the presence of a cytosolic ubiquitylation activity.",

We first coexpressed the VI-wt or VI-M1 mRFP fusion protein together with each of the E3 ligases fused to GFP in U2OS cells. When expressed alone, most ligases localized primarily to the cytoplasm (data not shown, WWP1 localized to the plasma membrane and WWP2 accumulated in an uncharacterized intracellular membrane compartment). In contrast, when VI-wt is coexpressed with Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2 or AIP4/Itch, the ligases are recruited to the same membrane compartment as protein VI ( Figure 7A, row 1-3 ). WWP1 appears to sequester protein VI at the plasma membrane ( Figure 7A, row 4) . WWP2 does not colocalize with VI-wt ( Figure 7A , row 5). We did not detect significant colocalization between VI-M1 and the E3 ligases, consistent with a PPxYdependent interaction ( Figure S6 ).",

We transduced cells in a dose-dependent manner to achieve different levels of knockdown. Transduction efficiency was monitored using a GFP expressing lentiviral vector in control cells. Seven days post-transduction shRNA treated cells were infected with AdGFP virus as described above and the transduction rate was determined by flow cytometry. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in infectivity for two different shRNAs against Nedd4.2, which was similar to what we observed when we used siRNAs ( Figure 8C ). The results for shRNAs against Nedd4.1 were less clear. One shRNA also reduced viral infection at very high transduction rates but to a lesser extent than shRNAs against Nedd4.2 while a second shRNA showed no effect on Ad transduction ( Figure 8C) .

Because knockdown of Nedd4 ligases also diminished transduction with AdGFP vectors we examined accumulation at the MTOC region in cells depleted with control shRNA and Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 specific shRNAs. We used the same strategy as in Figure 3 by quantifying viral particles in proximity to the MTOC, which was identified by stain for pericentrin.

For Ads, reaching the nucleus requires a series of sequential steps: receptor-mediated endocytic uptake, partial capsid disassembly, endosomal rupture, microtubule based transport to the MTOC and nuclear trafficking. The link between these steps has been best exemplified in the case of the thermostable temperature-sensitive mutant Ad2ts1. This mutant enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, but remains in an endosomal compartment due to increased capsid stability. Therefore, Ad2ts1 particles are directed to lysosomes for destruction and/or recycled back to the surface thus precluding accumulation at the nuclear pore complex [26, 28, 39] . The role of facilitating endosomal escape during Ad entry was initially assigned to the penton base [40] . Later, Wiethoff and co-workers showed that most membrane lytic activity of Ad viral capsids comes from the predicted N-terminal amphipathic helix of the internal capsid protein VI, and that membrane lytic activity required partial capsid disassembly to release protein VI [28] .",

We show that protein VI exposure from Ad5 capsids occurs within minutes when pre-adsorbed Ad5 is shifted from 4uC to 37uC. This is consistent with the loss of the fiber prior to internalization and the rapid accumulation of Ad5 in the cytosol [41, 42] . We found that significant amounts of protein VI remains partially associated with the viral capsid after the initial exposure and until the viral particle accumulates at the MTOC or the nuclear rim.",

            "text": "We show that protein VI is engaged in rapid intracellular trafficking that depends on intact microtubules and requires the Nterminal amphipathic helix for microtubule association and the PPxY motif for motion. To our knowledge protein VI is the first Ad capsid protein described that possesses its own microtubuledependent dynamics and future work has to address if other capsid proteins have similar properties. Inactivation of the PPxY in the viral context (Ad5-VI-M1) resulted in a post-entry delay that reduced infectivity and prevented efficient accumulation of the entering virus particles at the MTOC. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the PPxY motif in protein VI also plays a role in adenoviral replication, assembly or egress, our single round infection assays showed that the majority of the titer reduction for the mutant was related to steps prior to the initiation of replication or the delivery and expression of a reporter gene. Moreover, our data show that the efficiency with which a toxin is delivered to the cytosol during Ad infection is similar for mutant and wt virus. This provides strong evidence that the PPSY motif in protein VI has a function during cell entry, but probably only after endosomal membrane lysis has occurred. Current structural data place protein VI inside the assembled capsid, therefore potentially precluding it from functions during egress at least when capsid associated [43] [44] [45] . Our observations show that protein VI is exposed after entry and that capsid disassembly is required for its ubiquitylation, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the PPxY motif is accessible only during Ad entry following partial capsid disassembly. Furthermore, it is currently not clear whether late domains containing PPxY motifs present in other viral systems, which are required for viral egress, have additional functions. Mutational inactivation of PPxY motifs in the VP40 structural protein of Ebola virus and matrix protein of rabies virus both showed an attenuation of the virus and a reduction of infectivity [20, 46] . Interestingly, for Ebola virus, the PPxY mutants showed no budding defect, but virus production was reduced, which could indicate a disruption earlier on in the life cycle than previously thought [46] . For rabies virus, Wirblich et al. describe a Figure 7 . Protein VI interacts with Nedd4 ligases via the PPxY motif. A) Protein VI (VI-wt) was N-terminally fused to mRFP and co-transfected with GFP-Nedd4.1 (first row), GFP-Nedd4.2 (second row), GFP-AIP4/Itch (third row), GFP-WWP1 (fourth row) and GFP-WWP2 (last row). Confocal images of representative cells are shown and the mRFP signal for protein VI (left column), the GFP signal for the ligases (center column) and the merged signals together with DAPI stain of the nucleus (right column) is indicated above each column. Transfected plasmids are indicated. Colocalization of Nedd4 and protein VI results in a yellow signal. The scale bar is 10mm. B) Diverse GFP-tagged Nedd4 ligases were over-expressed in cells and cytosolic extracts were used for pulldown experiments using recombinant protein VI-wt or VI-M1 coupled to beads. 10% of the input material (IP) is shown in the first lane. Bound material for protein VI-wt (lane 2) and VI-M1 (lane 3) was detected with respective antibodies as indicated to the right.

It is possible that an interaction between protein VI and WWP1, as we observe in transient transfections, is circumvented by exposure of the PPxY domain after the virus has entered the endosomal compartment. A role for Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 in Ad entry is underscored by our observation that Nedd4.2 can directly ubiquitylate protein VI via the PPxY motif and its depletion (and to a lesser extent also depletion of Nedd4.1) reduces Ad transduction. In addition this depletion also reduced MTOC accumulation of viral particles following infection, which is similar to the effect of the PPxY mutation in the M1 virus. However the effects were modest, indicating that additional mechanisms contribute to Ad entry. Further studies will be needed to identify a specific role for each ligase in Ad entry and trafficking towards the MTOC and to determine whether other ligases like AIP4/Itch and WWP1 are involved.",

Ubiquitylated protein VI could be specifically recognized by cellular factors. Alternatively, recruitment of Nedd4.1 and/or Nedd4.2 by protein VI could result in the ubiquitylation of other cellular factors that constitute an efficient transport means used by the virus. Recent work has shown that some members of ESCRT-I become ubiquitylated when Nedd4.2 is overexpressed [18, 19] . Therefore, it is possible that Nedd4.2 (or other Nedd4-ligases) binding to protein VI could activate the ESCRT pathway via ubiquitylation. Whether membrane compartments or the ESCRT pathway plays a direct role in Ad virus transport during entry remains to be addressed. However, ESCRT components can be found at the endosomal compartments as well as associated with the centromeric region [47] . It is noteworthy that endosomal escape is also required for interferon induction by Ad via yet unknown mechanisms [48] . This pathway may also be related to protein interaction between protein VI and Nedd4-family ligases.",

Penton base also encodes PPxY motifs [49] . Because eliminating the PPxY motif from protein VI had only modest effects on MTOC accumulation, there may be functional overlap between the PPxY in protein VI and penton base.

A) To construct a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) carrying an infectious Ad5 genome, we cloned an AdEasy system (Stratagene) based virus genome into pKSB2 vector as described previously (Warming et al. [57] ; Ruzsics et al. [34] ). This recombinant Ad5 lacked the E1 and E3 regions and carried an FRT site in the place of its E1 region, which was introduced through an FRT containing pShuttle (Stratagene) clone. The resulting BAC, was termed pAd5-FRT and can be reconstituted to fully infectious recombinant Ad5 viruses after transfection of E1 complementing cell lines such as 293 cells. To construct protein VI-modified viruses, pAd5-FRT was transformed into the E. coli strain SW102, which encodes the l-red recombination system from the bacteriophage under a heatinducible promoter [57] . We next amplified a Kanamycin resistance cassette using primers with 50 nt 59 extensions homologous to protein VI coding regions. The forward primer was flanked with a homology located upstream to the PPSY motif and introduced a ClaI site into the protein VI ORF without affecting its amino acid sequence. The homology region attached to the reverse primers carried the same ClaI site and overlapped with the PPSY motif. Two different reverse primers were generated: one carried an unaltered PPSY motif and another that encoded the amino acids PGAA instead of PPSY and introduced an additional Pst I site by the new coding sequence. The PCR products were transformed into the SW102 bacteria harbouring the Ad5-BAC following heatshock to induce red-recombination. Chloramphenicol and kanamycin double resistant clones were selected and BAC DNA was prepared from individual clones. The isolated BAC DNA was digested with ClaI and subsequently religated. This procedure eliminated the kanamycin cassette and reconstituted the protein VI ORF concomitant to the recircularisation of the ClaI treated BACs, because there was no other ClaI site present in the rest of the pAd5-FRT. If the reverse primer with an intact PPSY motif was used for amplification, the wild type protein VI amino acid sequence was reconstituted with a silent genetic tag introducing a ClaI site. If the reverse primer with PGAA motif was used for amplification, the protein VI coding sequence was modified at two positions i) a silent genetic tag was inserted introducing a ClaI site as above and ii) the PPSY motif was replaced by the PGAA motif introducing a new PstI site. After the ClaI treatment and re-ligation the modified genomes were retransformed in E. coli DH10B. Kanamycin negative colonies were identified by replica plating and the resulting mutants were analysed by restriction digestions and verified by sequencing. The mutant Ad genomes were released from the respective BACs by Pac I digestion and transfected into 293 cells. Following the appearance of cytopathic effects the virus was amplified and purified by double CsCl banding, dialyzed into PBS/10% Glycerol and snap frozen. B) To verify the identity of the purified virions and analyse whether detectable reversion occurred during reconstitution and propagation of the virus stocks viral DNA was extracted from purified virions and was PCR amplified with protein VI specific primers. The PCR products were digested with Pst I (left) and Cla I (right) to identify the recombinant viruses with or without the altered protein VI sequences. To insert a GFP expression cassette we used bacterial Flp-recombination using the FRT site in the E1-deleted region of the Ad5-VI-wt and Ad5-VI-M1 BACs. We cloned the left end of the Ad5 (nt 1-341) flanked by a Pac I restriction site into the plasmid pOriR6K-ie [55] ; GenBank Acc. AY700022) upstream of its FRT site. We also replaced its zeocin resistance marker with an pGPS1.1(NEB) derived kanamycin cassette and cloned an EGFP ORF from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) in its expression locus and termed this plasmid pO6-A5-gfp. The pOriR6Kie derived plasmids can only be maintained in special E. coli strains such as PIR1 (Invitrogen) because they are dependent on the presence of R6Kc phage replicase [55] . To carry out the recombination, E. coli strain DH10B (Invitrogen) was co-transformed with pAd5-FRT derived BACs and pCP20 encoding the Flp-recombinase [56] and cultured at 30uC. The Flp recombinations were carried out as described in Bubeck et al. [55] . Briefly, the E. coli cell carrying the target BACs and the Flp expression plasmid pCP20 were transformed with the pO6-A5-GFP and selected for chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance upon induction of the Flp expression by a temperature shift to 43uC. This treatment induced a recombination between the two FRT sites (one in the pAd5-FRT derivative and one on the pO6-A5-gfp) and induced unification of the BAC and the pO6 construct. Only the recombined construct survived the double selection because pO6 constructs are not maintained in DH10B. This approach essentially replaced the old left end of the Ad5 BAC by a CMV promoter driven GFP-expression cassette containing fragment, which also possessed all the cis elements needed for virus reconstitution as described above.

A) Shown is a comparison of the growth of individual plaques starting from a single infected cell. E1 complementing 911 cells were infected at low multiplicity of infection with Ad5GFP-VI-wt and the PPxY mutant virus Ad5GFP-VI-M1 for 24 h and then washed and overlayed with agarose. Virus growth was monitored by the appearance of GFPpositive cells and images of representative cells/plaques were taken on days 1, 3, 9 and 12. The images in the left row show the plaque formation of the wild type virus 1, 3, 9 and 12 days after the initial infection (top-to-bottom). At day 9 and 12 significant large plaques with lesions of the cell monolayer can be observed. In contrast the mutant virus to the right shows a slow expansion of GFP-positive plaques with less damage to the cell monolayer. Images are superimpositions of the GFP signal and the phase contrast image of the monolayer. B) The image shows the damage in the cell monolayer caused by plaque formation on day 12. The arrow indicates the average size of the plaque. The scale bar is 50 mm.

A) Localization and sequences of conserved PPxY-motifs in protein VI and penton for Ad5 (black box). Note that processed protein VI is shown as it is present in the capsid during viral entry. B) Schematic representation of the in vitro ubiquitylation assay. Virus disassembly was induced by mild heattreatment, in vitro ubiquitylated using ubiquitin or recombinant GST-ubiquitin, recombinant E1 and E2, an energy regenerating system and purified cytosol as source for the E3-ligase and analyzed by western blot. Controls lack the mild heat-treatment. C) Western blot analysis of viral capsid proteins penton, fiber and protein IIIA following capsid disassembly and in vitro ubiquitylation. Heat-treatment is indicated above each lane. Antibodies are indicated to the right of each blot. Specific bands are labeled accordingly. Grey arrows indicate band shifts due to ubiquitylation, black arrows indicates the unmodified protein. D) Western blot analysis of in vitro ubiquitylation reactions of heat-treated viral particles. Heat treatment is indicated above each lane. For individual reactions the cytosol was depleted with recombinant fiber beads (control), recombinant VI-wt beads or recombinant VI-M1 beads as indicated above each lane. Reactions were blotted with anti-penton. The assay shows that the ubiquitylation activity can be depleted from cytosol with recombinant wt protein VI but not when the PPSY motif is mutated. The same assay also abolishes protein VI ubiquitylation showing that similar ubiquitylation activities are responsible (data not shown). E) Protein VI depleted cytosol renders Nedd4.2 active for penton ubiquitylation. In vitro ubiquitylation reactions using catalytically active or inactive Nedd4.2 substituted with cytosol depleted by protein VI-wt (as indicated above each lane) and analyzed by western blot with antipenton antiserum. Black arrows indicate ubiquitylated proteins, grey arrows the unmodified protein. This assay shows that additional cytosolic factors are required for full Nedd4.2 activity for penton ubiquitylation.

The movie was acquired using a Nikon TE 2000 microscope equipped with Cascade 512B 2 camera at 1 frame per second. The movie shows rapid intracellular movement of VI-wt depicting compartments resembling vesicular, tubulo-vesicular and reticular structures. Video S2 Comparison of intracellular dynamics for VI-wt vs. VI-M1 vs. VI-wt (+ nocodazole). U2OS cells were transfected with VI-wt (left and right panel) or VI-M1 (middle panel) fused to mRFP. The cell to the right was treated with nocodazole (5 mg/ml) prior to image acquisition. Movies were acquired using a Nikon TE 2000 microscope equipped with Cascade 512B 2 camera at 1 frame per second. The movies were labeled and assembled using imageJ and converted into QuickTime TM movies. All three displayed movies were taking at the same frame rate. The movies show rapid intracellular movement of VI-wt at nearly real-time (left). VI-M1 shows strongly reduced movement (middle). Treatment of VI-wt transfected cells with nocodazole, strongly reduces the VI-wt movement resembling VI-M1 dynamics (right). Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000808.s008 (1.21 MB MOV)",

Left panel; Shown is the percentage of viral particles that are positive for protein VI co-stain (+/2 standard deviation) at different time points. Over 700 particles were counted for each condition. Due to the strong overlap of the signals 45 min after infection at the MTOC region for the wt, colocalization is given as an approximate value. Right panel; Intracellular localization of protein VI and capsids 45 min after infection. The panel shows Alexa488 labeled Ad5-VI-wt (top panel) or Ad5-VI-M1 (bottom panel) capsids in green and protein VI detected with protein VI specific antibodies in red 45 min after infection of U2OS cells. Colocalization of protein VI and the capsid appear as yellow. The scale bar is 10 mm. B) Ad-VI-M1 has a reduced MTOC accumulation. Left panel; Cells were infected with fluorescently labeled Ad5-VI-wt (top) or Ad5-VI-M1 (bottom). Subcellular localization in a representative cell is shown after 45 min. The scale bar is 10 mm. A quantification of the MTOC localization is shown to the right. Cells were synchronous infected with Alexa488 labeled Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1 respectively after preadsorption in the cold. 45 min post infection cells were fixed and stained for the MTOC using a rabbit anti-pericentrin antibody. To quantify the targeting of the virus towards the MTOC, confocal 0.4 mm sections were taken around the MTOC stain (,3-5 sections), and combined using maximum image membrane association, causing nuclear targeting of protein VI and redistribution of protein VI from membrane fractions into soluble fractions ([37], and Figure 4 bottom row, data not shown).",

U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAs specific for Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2, AIP4/Itch, WWP1 and WWP2 or scrambled siRNAs. Western blot controls for depletion are shown to the left (except for WWP1 where depletion of transfected WWP1-GFP was detected using GFP specific antibodies because no specific antibodies were available for detection of the endogenous protein). Following depletion, cells were transduced with AdGFP. Relative GFP expression is shown. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise comparison using the Mann & Whitneytest showing significant reduction for Nedd4.2 depleted cells. B) In vitro ubiquitylation reaction using recombinant active Nedd4.2 (lane 1 and 2) or inactive Nedd4.2 (lane 3). Recombinant VI-wt (lane 1 and 3) or VI-M1 (lane 2) was used as substrate.

The cells were washed once with DMEM without cysteine or methionine and supplemented, 2 mM glutamine, 10% dialyzed FCS, penicillin and streptomycin (DMEM-SA) and infected with the respective viruses in 50 ml DMEM-SA containing 0.1 mg/well asarcin (Sigma). The infected cells were incubated 30 min at 4uC to facilitate virus attachment and 90 min at 37uC to facilitate virus internalization. After this 50 ml of DMEM-SA containing 0.1 mCi of [35S]L-methionine (Hartmann Analytic) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 60 min at 37uC for labeling. The cells were then washed with 100 ml PBS and extracted in 150 ml lyses buffer containing 1% Triton-X100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 16 Complete TM protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 12 min. To remove the residual [35S]L-methionine, 100 ml cleared lysates were further purified with Zeba Desalt Spin Columns (Pierce). The incorporation [35S]L-methionine into the extracted fraction of newly synthesized proteins was measured by liquid scintillation using TRI-CARB 1900CA counter (Packard).",
