Although more than 200 viruses -some of them deadly zoonotic viruses -have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.",

Humans have responded to these diseases in rapid and often unprepared and disorganised ways. In part, this has occurred because bat biologists have been in denial regarding their favourite mammals due to the fear of further damage to the illogical and false reputation of bats as vampires and as carriers of rabies virus. This has been a disservice to both our understanding of the biology of bats and to the various medical and research communities and their patrons. False images of bats engendered by entertaining, but preposterous motion pictures, alarmist stories in the popular press and ancient superstitions have been embedded in the minds of the public and have impeded education and acceptance of these remarkable, useful and widely diverse animals. Thus, until relatively recently, studies of the relationships of bats and viruses have lagged far behind studies of viruses in humans, livestock, birds, other wild vertebrates and arthropods (Calisher et al. 2006) .",

In addition, bats of some species adapt well to disturbed habitats (Jones et al. 2009 ), so that these vertebrates have quickly become a focus of epidemiologic studies. However, most epidemiologists know bats only from outdated information or know very little or nothing about their biology, ecology and evolution. A similar situation occurs regarding bat biologists, many of whom know little or nothing about diseases ostensibly associated with bats. In an attempt to fill the gaps in knowledge about bats in general, bats as virus hosts and bat diseases, we review many aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution, which we expect will enlighten medical investigations. In addition, we provide a historical synthesis of disease outbreaks causally linked to bats and which have caused isolated deaths or severe outbreaks of diseases. By linking these aspects, we then attempt to fit together some pieces of this puzzle. We anticipate that this review will stimulate collaborations between bat biologists and medical researchers in field and laboratory investigations concerning both basic and applied research.",

They are the second most widespread order of mammals, surpassed only by Primates due to the wide distribution of humans. Due to their ability to fly, they have colonised many oceanic islands and on some they are the only native mammals (Koopman 1994) . Among the families recognised currently (Fenton & Simmons 2015) , Emballonuridae, Mo-lossidae and Vespertilionidae occur in both the New and Old World, Cistugidae, Craseonycteridae, Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, Miniopteridae, Mystacinidae, Myzopodidae, Nycteridae, Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae and Rhinopomatidae occur only in the Old World, and Furipteridae, Mormoopidae, Natalidae, Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae and Thyropteridae occur only in the New World. Table I provides information on distribution and diet of bats by family. The evolution of flight -the most peculiar characteristic of bats and one of the most important for their wide distribution -may have had effects on some aspects of the evolution of the immune system and the metabolism of bats, allowing them to host so many viruses (O'Shea et al. 2014 , Brook & Dobson 2015 .",

They can use hollows (caves, mines, tree trunks, buildings etc.), crevices and foliage as day roosts (Fig. 1 ) and many frugivorous and insectivorous bats are known to use night roosts for eating and grooming. Partially eaten fruits and insects and droppings can be found on the ground of their night roosts (Fenton 1983 ) and they are good indicators of the items included in their diet.

In hibernating bats of various species, copulation generally occurs in the fall, either with ovulation and fertilisation occurring immediately, followed by a slow development of the fetus throughout the winter and birth in the spring, or with sperm storage until spring, after which ovulation, fertilisation and foetal development occurs. In migratory bats, mating is generally concentrated in the early spring, after they reach their summer roosts. These bats and several others that do not need to migrate or hibernate, but that live in areas with food availability varying seasonally, reproduce once a year (monoestrus), whereas others facing less marked seasonal variation or having food resources available year-round generally reproduce twice or more a year (polyestrus). The former pattern is characteristic of most insectivorous bats from temperate regions, whereas the latter is common in most frugivorous bats living in tropical regions. Gestation averages about two months and bats of most species produce a single young per litter, but a few produce twins and a very few produce three or four young at a time (Wilson 1997) . Halpin et al. (2000) isolated Hendra virus from uterine fluid and foetal tissues of bats and Drexler et al.

Bats can live 3.5 times longer, on average, than non-volant placental mammals with similar body size (Wilkinson & South 2002 ) and, considering their size, they live longer than any other mammal (Bouliere 1958 , Austad & Fischer 1991 . The maximum age varies greatly from species to species, but while small rodents live in the wild about one-two years, a bat with similar body size can live more than 30 years. A Brandt's bat [Myotis brandtii (Vespertilionidae)] from Siberia was recaptured 41 years after the first capture (Podlutsky et al. 2005) , but records of bats older than 30 years are known only for bats of five species in the wild (Wilkinson & South 2002) . Genome and transcriptome analyses have revealed unique sequence changes that appear to contribute to both the small body size and the long lifespan of bats (Seim et al. 2013) .",

This variety of behaviours has been arranged into eight main feeding categories: fruit eaters, flower feeders, aerial insectivores (those that capture insects in flight), foliage gleaners (capture insects on the ground), carnivores (feed on small terrestrial vertebrates, including birds, frogs and mammals), fish eaters, blood feeders and omnivores (Wilson 1973) . Phyllostomids -also called New World leaf-nosed bats and restricted to the Neotropics -include representatives classified in quite distinct categories ( Fig. 2A-F nophyllinae. Pteropodids -the fruit bats restricted to the Old World tropics (Old World fruit bats) -also include fruit eaters and nectar feeders ( Fig. 2G -I). Except for representatives of these two families, bats are primarily animal feeders, generally insect eaters. Some pteropodid and phyllostomid bats that feed on fruits reject the fibres and other indigestible components. They chew and ingest the pulp and juices and drop the fibrous material and larger seeds that can be found on the ground below their night roosts. They swallow smaller seeds that pass quickly and undamaged through the bat's gastrointestinal tract (ca. 20 min). Using a similar strategy to increase feeding efficiency, insect-eaters from various families may cull the insects they prey on, consuming the most nutritional part (the abdomen) and discarding wings, head and appendages (Fenton 1983 .",

The viruses are representatives of 27 virus families, which is a remarkable diversity (Calisher 2015) . This suggests that viruses detected in bats are unlikely to be there by chance, simply a series of oddities. Indeed, when concerted efforts have been made to search for viruses of specific families, such as coronaviruses (CoVs) and herpesviruses, a large number of these viruses were detected and a substantial proportion of them have been shown to be previously unrecognised viruses or viral subtypes. Because some investigators search only for particular viruses or for viruses of particular families it is certain that many viruses must have been overlooked, so that the lists in the Table II and Supplementary Table II surely underrepresent the actual situation in nature. (2015); b: many of the viruses listed in this Table were first isolated from sources other than bats. The bat hosts listed here are those from which these viruses were first obtained or otherwise detected. Note that certain of the viral nucleic acid sequences detected have been identified to virus family or to genus, but not to species, thus this is a provisional list; c: vernacular names of bats follow primarily Wilson and Reeder (2005) .

Numerous books and scientific publications are in print or otherwise available which provide details regarding Louis Pasteur's efforts to devise a vaccine against the disease called rabies (L. rabies, rage, madness). Classical rabies virus (street rabies) is the prototype virus of a complex of viruses that have been detected in bats, dogs and other mammals. This negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus has been classified in the virus order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae (Gr. rhabdos, rod) and genus Lyssavirus (Gr. lyssa, rage, fury, canine madness).",

Even as far back as 2300 BC dog owners in the Babylonian city of Eshnunna were fined for deaths caused by their dogs having bitten people. In 500 BC, the Greek philosopher Democritus described a case of canine rabies. In 400 BC, Aristotle wrote 'dogs suffer from the madness. This causes them to become very irritable and all animals they bite become diseased', In the first century, Roman writer Cardanus described the saliva from a rabid dog as a 'virus' (L. virus, poison). In 1804, a German scientist, Georg Gottfried Zinke, demonstrated that rabies could be passed through saliva from rabid dogs.",

For many years thereafter, diagnostic techniques began to be improved, epidemiologic investigations expanded, specific monoclonal antibodies produced and applied and investigations of rabies virus put on a molecular basis, but the primary advance in rabies diagnosis was the development of an immunofluorescence test in the 1950s, used to detect rabies virus antigens (Goldwasser & Kissling 1958) .

A paramyxovirus cultured from his kidney was shown to be identical to viruses isolated from the lungs of five affected horses.

Neutralising antibodies to Nipah virus were detected in pteropodid bats of five species in Malaysia, suggesting widespread infection in bats there. Soon thereafter the virus was detected in urine of variable flying-foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) and in fruits partially eaten by them, confirming these bats as natural hosts of the virus (Chua et al. 2002) . Taken together, the epidemiologic portrait was that climatic and humandriven ecologic changes and locations of pig farms in orchards, which are home to fruit bats, provided settings in which Nipah virus can switch species, from fruit bats to pigs to humans.

By late April 2003, more than 4,000 SARS cases and 250 SARS-related deaths were reported to the WHO from more than 25 countries. Most of these cases occurred after exposure to SARS patients in health care or household settings.",

Attempts to identify the causative agent of the outbreak were successful during 2003, when laboratories in the United States of America (USA), Canada, Germany and Hong Kong isolated a novel CoV (SARS CoV) from SARS patients. Classified as a virus in the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus CoV, unlike other human CoVs, this one can be isolated in Vero cells. SARS CoV RNA has frequently been detected in respiratory secretions and convalescent-phase serum specimens from SARS patients contain antibodies that react with SARS CoV, altogether providing evidence that it was a newly recognised virus and associated with the disease. The source of the virus in nature had not been determined at that time, but knowing it was a CoV made the search easier.",

Poon et al. (2005) , searching for the SARS CoV in Hong Kong bats, came close to succeeding, being the first to detect a CoV (group 1, i.e., alphacoro-naviurs) in bats; a retrospective study of samples collected for other purposes demonstrated the presence of an alphacoronavirus RNA sequence in an Australian bat captured in 1996 (LL Poon, unpublished observations). Then Lau et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2005) reported detections of (group 2, i.e., betacoronavirus) SARS CoVlike viruses in bats, thus providing evidence that bats are a natural source of at least some of the numerous alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus found world-wide (Osborne et al. 2011) . By now, partial descriptions of many hitherto unrecognised coronaviral sequences have been published in the scientific literature. Without more biological and epidemiological information it is difficult to determine whether these represent newly recognised viruses, are closely or distantly related strains or are more items to add to lists; these are not tabulated in Table II . Obviously, evidence of the presence of many important viruses in bats has served to invigorate studies of the biology of bats themselves as well as the discovery of disease-associated viruses.",

MERS affects the respiratory system and most MERS patients develop severe acute respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath. The case-fatality rate of MERS is about 45%. Through retrospective investigations, health officials later showed that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in 2012. Thus far, all cases of MERS have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. As of 23 January 2015, there have been 956 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS CoV infection, including 351 deaths, a large proportion of whom had pre-existing co-morbidities. Because of its similarity to the SARS CoV, it had been anticipated that bats were somehow involved in transmission of the MERS CoV and Memish et al. (2013) detected a partial RNA sequence of a betacoronavirus with 100% identity to virus from the human index casepatient. This nucleotide sequence was obtained from a faecal pellet from an Egyptian tomb bat [Taphozous perforatus (Emballonuridae) (Memish et al. 2013) ] in Saudi Arabia, and a close relative of this virus was detected in a Zulu serotine bat [Neoromicia cf. zuluensis (Vespertilionidae)] by Ithete et al. (2013) in South Africa. However, recent studies have suggested that one-humped camels [Camelus dromedarius (Artiodactyla, Camelidae)] may be a primary source of this virus in nature (Raj et al. 2014 ) and experimental infections of camels with MERS CoV seem to support this view (Adney et al. 2014) .

Another infection with this virus occurred in a traveller in Africa in 1975 and cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been documented with some frequency in various parts of Africa since then. Although a great deal was learned about this virus from pathologic and laboratory studies, its epidemiology remained undetermined. Nonetheless, bits and pieces of evidence suggested that bats might be associated with Marburg virus. It was not until 1999 that Swanepoel et al. (2007) Ebolavirus diseases -In 1976, a series of severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fevers occurred in southern Sudan. Almost immediately after those cases were recognised, a similar disease was observed in humans in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nearly 1,000 km away. A virus, originally termed 'Ebola virus', named after the Ebola River near the epidemic site in Zaire, was isolated from patients in Zaire and partially characterised (Johnson et al. 1977) but, as with Marburg virus, early intensive field studies did not reveal the source of the virus.

(2005) collected small vertebrates at sites where non-human primates had died at the border between Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. They detected RNA of an ebolavirus in hammerheaded fruit bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus), Franquet's epauletted fruit bats (Epomops franqueti) and little collared fruit bats (Myonycteris torquata). These RNA sequences were quite similar to those of the ebolavirus isolated from humans during the 1976 outbreak in Zaire. Other investigations led to antibody detections in bats of the same species. Leroy et al. (2005) detected ebolaviral RNA from them and from other pteropodids and molossids as well (Olival & Hayman 2014 ). This has been the ostensible link for an association of bats with Zaire ebolavirus and confirmed their speculation that ebolaviruses circulate in the forests of Central Africa (Leroy et al. 2005) . The West African ongoing outbreak that is ravaging Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, initiated more than one year ago, has sickened more than 20,000 people and killed more than 8,000 of them to date. Although these countries are geographically closer to the Ivory Coast than the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, Baize et al. (2014) Based on the work of Leroy et al. (2005) , frugivorous bats were tentatively linked to the ongoing outbreak in West Africa (Baize et al. 2014 ), but field investigations raised a new scenario for the emergence of the virus. According to Sa\u00e9z et al. (2015) , the index case (a 2-yearold boy from the small village of Meliandou, Guinea) may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree used to house a colony of Angolan free-tailed bats -a species widespread in Central and West Africa. The tree was burned and the colony no longer lives in the hollow. During field investigations Sa\u00e9z et al. (2015) found no infected bats; however, Angolan free-tailed bats are among those that have survived experimental infections (Swanepoel et al. 1996) . Thus, the accumulated evidence, while implicating bats in transmission of many viruses, may only be coincidental and remains unproven.",

That is, why (or how) do bats survive infections with viruses and other agents that are pathogenic for other vertebrates? Or do they? These questions have not been answered satisfactorily and data accumulated thus far have not definitively answered them, but have led to speculation, much of which is fascinating. Serologic studies demonstrated that bats have antibody to many viruses, but it was not determined whether their antibody isotypes were similar to those of other mammals. Nearly 50 years ago, for example, Sulkin et al. (1966) maintained big brown bats [Eptesicus fuscus (Vespertilionidae)] experimentally infected with Japanese encephalitis virus at various environmental temperatures and then tested them for both virus and neutralising antibody. Viraemias were demonstrable in most of these bats within two-three days after infection and persisted for one-two weeks. However, not all viraemic bats produced antibody to the virus, a few others had equivocal and then delayed (nearly 2 months) antibody responses and some that had produced antibody soon after being infected no longer had detectable antibody three months later.",

It is further reasonable to assume that this in turn might allow at least low-level virus replication over an extended period. There is some evidence that these genes may be evolving more rapidly in bats than in vertebrates of other taxa, which would suggest that the genes are co-evolving with the bats in response to viral and other infections. An additional note of caution: when studying viruses from bats in order to understand their effects, it is clearly more ap-propriate to use bats or their cells in culture, rather than other hosts or cells from other hosts. That is, simply because a virus or other pathogen might interfere with or activate a gene product in one host, there is no certainty that it does the same in another host; thus the extrapolatory and speculatory nature of many available publications. A recent paper by Zhang et al. (2012) provides a new insight into the interplay between bat host and infecting virus. The authors isolated a novel \u03b2-herpesvirus from a Schreibers's long-fingered bat and, in determining its complete DNA genome sequence, found it to be the first virus genome known to encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II homologues. The authors proposed future functional studies of these MHC class II homologues to determine whether they may play a role in potentially novel virus immune evasion pathways (Zhang et al. 2012 ). This remarkable finding may change the way we view both bats as hosts and viruses as pathogens.",

Further, it has been proposed that the rapid reestablishment of immune responses in bats emerging from hibernation and infected with the white-nose syndrome fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Ascomycota, Pseudeurotiaceae), may bring about a severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (Meteyer et al. 2012) .",

A few hypotheses have been raised to explain so many viruses in bats (O'Shea et al. 2014 , Brook & Dobson 2015 .

In most cases, the only evidence is the isolation or otherwise detection of the same viruses in bats and humans in areas where the diseases have emerged, but this does not mean that bats are the hosts for the viruses. The identification of the same virus in bats and humans might only be evidence that as mammals they are similar enough to serve as temporary hosts for the virus and the same virus can also be found in other terrestrial vertebrates (e.g., primates, antelopes, birds) and arthropods (Calisher et al. 2006 , Melaun et al. 2014 . As an example, Ross River virus has been isolated from gray-headed flying-foxes, but these bats did not produce viraemia of sufficient magnitude to be considered competent reservoir hosts for this virus (Ryan et al. 1997) . Alternatively, Seymour et al. (1978a) detected specific antibodies of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in bats of seven different species from Guatemala. Based on this evidence, Seymour et al. (1978b) experimentally infected bats of five species. Viraemia was detected in most bats, but all were asymptomatic for the infection. They concluded that the phyllostomids Jamaican fruiteating bats, great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus) and little yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) had circulating virus levels high enough to infect culicid mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) that may serve as vectors for the virus, whereas great spear-nosed bats [Phyllostomus hastatus (Phyllostomidae)] did not develop sufficient viraemia to infect subsequently feeding mosquitoes (Seymour et al. 1978b ). Based on these results, we can speculate that there is variability of the immune responses of bats to virus infections, particularly in representatives of closely related species.",

In other events, camels and carnivores (ferrets, palm civets and raccoon dogs) also figure among the mammals in which viruses apparently circulate. Except for humans, these mammals are from groups that have evolved within the superorder Laurasiatheria.

This suggests that they may share physiological characteristics that could facilitate circulation of these viruses. Dobson (2006) visited pig farm sites where outbreaks of Nipah virus infections occurred in Malaysia and found partially eaten fruits with bat teeth marks in them. According to Dobson (2006) , pigs may have been contaminated by eating fruits that had been partly eaten by bats and subsequently passed the virus to humans. This hypothesis was tentatively rejected by Fenton et al. (2006) based on the argument that pellets rejected by frugivorous bats are composed of indigestible fibres and seeds that have little nutritional value for animals. However, one of us (RM) several times has found on the ground fruits that had been partially eaten by bats (e.g., Fig. 3) ; there is no reason to believe that other frugivorous or omnivorous mammals, such as primates and carnivores, do not feed on them. Given that Chua et al. (2002) detected Nipah virus in fruits partially eaten by variable flying-foxes, this general scenario seems very reasonable. Using Dobson's (2006) hypothesis as a background, pigs became infected with Nipah virus by eating virus-contaminated fruits and then humans became infected by spillover from pigs, which may have occurred by contact with massive quantities of viruses in the mucosae, faeces or excreta of infected animals. Haematophagous insects may also be virus vectors. Melaun et al. (2014) provided an extensive list of viruses that have been identified in bats, haematophagous insects and humans. With bats spending most of their time stationary and upside down, some of them forming large groups, they are perfect targets for feeding arthropods, particularly mosquitoes. However, it is unlikely that arthropods are important vectors of filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and many other viruses, including rabies virus, as they have not been detected in them even though millions of them have been tested. Mechanical transmission of viruses, however, is always a possibility, but is irrelevant when discussing natural hosts.",

            "text": "The taxonomic and geographic distribution of bats whose viruses have potentially jumped to humans is also noteworthy. Except for rabies, all episodes are in the Old World and pteropodid, hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats -representatives of families in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera -have been mostly involved (Table  II, Supplementary Table II) . To date, there is no direct evidence that New World bats play important roles in the transmission of zoonotic viruses, other than rabies virus, to humans. This might be caused by a sampling bias because most studies have been concentrated in the Old World tropics; but most studies are concentrated in the Old World because people and livestock are dying there from those diseases. However, it may not be a biased view. Differences in the evolutionary history and biology of New and Old World bats and in human behaviour may provide reasonable explanations. From an evolutionary viewpoint, Old World bats occur in a region where the mammalian fauna was established long ago and those bat lineages may have coevolved with viruses that may have been present in other groups of mammals. In this scenario, bats might have developed strategies to survive virus infections. On the other hand, the assemblage of New World mammals (in particular that from South and Central America) was dramatically reshaped about three million years ago due to the Great American Biotic Interchange (Marshall et al. 1982 ) and bat and virus lineages may not have had time to coevolve. In addition, all New World bats are in the suborder Yangochiroptera, whereas pteropodids, hipposiderids and rhinolophids are in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. The basal divergence among these suborders is almost as old as the divergence of bats and other mammals (Springer et al. 2001 ). Thus, we speculate that bats in these two groups may have evolved distinct immunological characteristics that provide distinct responses to pathogens, with direct implications regarding their roles as hosts. From an ecological viewpoint, some pteropodid bats tend to form large aggregations that may favour virus spread, whereas New World fruit bats usually form smaller aggregations. Also, except for a few native indigenous peoples, in the New World bats are not on the menu, which is different from Africa and Asia where these animals are consumed regularly. Eating them seems not to be a problem because their meat is cooked. The problem appears to be in the contact with their infected blood and other body fluids during handling and preparing their meat. Contact with massive quantities of viruses unquestionably favours spillovers. The above suggestions here are no more than speculations pending formal assessment.",

They are widely distributed on the continent, adapt well to human constructions and feed on insects (Nowak 1994 , Eger 2008 , making them easy to maintain in captivity.
