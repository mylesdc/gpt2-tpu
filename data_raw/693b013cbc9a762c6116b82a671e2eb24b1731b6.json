Different immune-based assays have been reported for the detection and quantification of Ebola virus (EBOV) proteins. In particular, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that bind the capsid glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV GP. However, the currently available platforms for the design and production of full-length mAbs are cumbersome and costly. The use of antibody fragments, rather than full-length antibodies, might represent a cost-effective alternative for the development of diagnostic and possibly even therapeutic alternatives for EBOV.",

Briefly, mAb 13C6 is one of the three full-length mAbs contained in M-003 (from Mapp Biopharmaceuticals), a formulation with proven protection against a lethal EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates [29, 30, 31] . Full-length mAb 13C6 is also a constituent in Zmapp, the mAb cocktail recently administered to human patients with apparent good results [32] . Mab 13C6 binds the glycan cap region of the glycoprotein (GP) [33] . MAb 13F6 is one of the constituents of ZMab, another anti-EBOV full-length mAb cocktail from Mapp Biopharmaceuticals [34, 35] . It binds the mucin-like domain (MLD) in GP, a highly glycosylated region that is cleaved upon the internalization of viral particles into the host cells [33] . KZ52 is a full-length mAb originally isolated from an Ebola disease (EBD) survivor. The 3D structure of this mAb bound to trimeric GP was characterized in detail by Lee et al.

These fragments contained the variable regions (heavy and light) of three well-studied fulllength mAbs referred in literature as 13C6, 13F6, and KZ52 (Fig 1A) [28] . Here, the corresponding mAb fragments are referred to as scFv-13C6, and scFv-13F6, and Fab-KZ52. The scFv-13C6 and scFv-13F6 proteins are single-chain variable fragments. The scFvs are the smallest stable antibody fragments capable of specifically binding an antigen. Generically, they are a recombinant polypeptide composed of an antibody variable light-chain amino acid sequence (VL) linked to a variable heavy-chain sequence (VH) by a designed peptide (of 10 to about 25 amino acids) that links the carboxyl terminus of the VL sequence to the amino terminus of the VH sequence. Fab-KZ52 was not strictly designed as an scFV, since it also contained portions of the constant heavy and constant light chains of full-length mAb KZ52 (see Fig 1B  and 1C ; Table 1 ). Fig 2A shows the SDS-PAGE protein profiles of samples of bacterial suspensions of scFv-13C6, scFv-13F6, and Fab-KZ52 producer strains cultured in an instrumented 1.5 L bioreactor. We observed similar protein profiles and a similar degree of expression of the three fragments, as measured by SDS-PAGE gels and western blotting (Fig 2A and 2B ). Cells were induced with IPTG at t = 8 h of culture. After induction, a band of protein of 30-50 KDa (30, 37, and 50 KDa for scFv-13C6, scFv-13F6, and Fab-KZ52 respectively) was observed, in agreement with the molecular weight of these fragments (Fig 2A and 2B) . The additional bands in the Fab-KZ52 lane suggest the occurrence of a certain degree of fragmentation during culture.",

            "text": "All three antibody fragments exhibited selective GP binding activity in ELISA experiments, but significant differences in binding activity and selectivity were found among them. Fig 3C  shows a comparison of the binding activity against GP (orange columns) as determined in ELISA assays, where GP is attached to the assay surface. The scFv-13C6 mAb exhibited the highest GP-binding activity, followed by scFv-13F6 and Fab-KZ52. The absorbance signal ratio between positive binding samples and blanks (no fragment added) was 10.18(\u00b11.246), 13.93 (\u00b11.397), and 19.08(\u00b11.750) for Fab-KZ52, scFv13F6, and scFv-13C6, respectively. We run additional negative controls, using human serum-from Mexican patients exposed to Influenza A/H1N1/2009 and presumably negative for Ebola-instead of PBS. These negative controls exhibit a similar absolute absorbance signal to that of a PBS sample. Although fragment Fab-KZ52 did bind to GP, its affinity and selectivity were the lowest among the three fragments tested. A probable explanation for this could be the nature of the KZ52 epitope. While the conformational epitopes for 13C6 and 13F6 only include GP1 domain residues [33] , KZ52 (and its analogous fragment Fab-KZ52) should interact with residues at GP1 and GP2 for proper binding. Any misalignment of the variable regions in the fragment could conceivably cause a decrease in binding efficacy [41] . In addition, the Fab-KZ52 epitope is less exposed than the scFv-13C6 or scFv-13F6. Since the access to the KZ52 epitope is sterically more impaired (not shown), the proper alignment of GP molecules could favor the access of antibody fragments to it. We tested this hypothesis by conducting binding experiments using a slightly modified ELISA format in which a layer of anti-histidine IgGs was dispensed at the surface of the assay wells for later addition of his-tagged rGP. While the direct attachment of rGP to the assay surface does not favor any particular alignment of the molecule, the layer of anti-histidine antibodies induces a preferred orientation for the His-tagged GP ( Fig 4A) and HA-RBD molecules. Indeed, further improvement in the performance of ELISA Fab-KZ52 experiments was achieved by using an anti-histidine IgG layer (Fig 4C) . The average Fab-KZ52 GP binding affinity (normalized by the negative control) increased 65.00%(\u00b129.94%), from 10.18(\u00b11.246) (Fig 3C) to 16 .61(\u00b12.674) (Fig 4C) . Interestingly, the average GP-binding affinity of the other two fragments (scFv-13C6 and scFv-13F6) decreased. On average, the apparent scFv-13F6 GP binding affinity decreased 30.20%(\u00b110.69%) (from 13.93(\u00b11.397) to 9.65 (\u00b11.336) normalized units) and the apparent scFv-13C6 GP binding affinity decreased by 41.34%(\u00b16.54)% (from 19.08(\u00b11.750) to 11.12(\u00b10.938) normalized units) (see Figs 3C and 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of molecular orientation and alignment are relevant in the design of strategies for the diagnosis, capture, or blockage of EBOV. They also suggest that it may be useful to include more than one antibody fragment (actually a cocktail of them) to maximize binding.",

Fig 5A-5C shows results from Fab-KZ52 + GP ELISA experiments that evaluated two different anti-histidine IgG surface densities associated with the use of two different anti-histidine IgG coating solution concentrations (1 or 5 \u03bcg/mL). The non-specific binding of Fab-KZ52 to HA-RBD was also measured (Fig 5B) . The sensitivity of the assay was higher for the surface with lower anti-histidine IgG density. On average, the ratio of absorbance signals between positive samples (Fab-KZ52 + GP) and negative controls was 13.86(\u00b11.053) and 9.03(\u00b10.337) units, respectively, in assays with surfaces treated with 1 and 5 \u03bcg/mL of anti-histidine IgGs (Fig 5C) . This ratio increased to 16.61(\u00b12.674) units in assays conducted on surfaces treated with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of 13C6 to GP was evaluated in ELISA experiments where a layer of anti-histidine IgGs was first dispensed on the surface of assay wells (grey Ys) for later attachment of an rGP layer (yellow ovals with orange stalks). The presence of the mAb fragment+GP complexes was revealed by the addition of a solution of anti-histidine polyclonal-IgGs (grey Ys with green fluorescent stars). (C) Negative control experiments consisted of the use of Infliximab (anti-rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic mAb; black mAb with pink variable regions) instead of an anti-GP mAb or fragment. (D) Binding activity (in terms of arbitrary absorbance units), as determined by ELISA experiments of the full-length mAbs-13F6 (black mAb with green variable regions), Fab-KZ52 (burgundy fragment), scFv-13F6 (green fragment), and scFv-13C6 (blue fragment) to GP (yellow ovals with orange stalks). The absorbance reading of negative controls are also shown (pink bars). Each panel shows results from experiments conducted at two different concentrations of the anti-histidine IgG solution (1 or 5 \u03bcg/mL) used to treat the assay surface. Error bars indicate standard deviation from at least two repeats of independent ELISA experiments. No normalization has been performed.

We also revealed the GP&mAb-13F6 complex by using a marked poly-clonal IgG cocktail instead of anti-histidine IgGs (data not shown).

This finding is of substantial relevance to the design of GP detection methods (and even therapeutic strategies). The use of antibody fragments rather than full length antibodies will significantly reduce the cost of production of Ebola diagnostic devices. The production of mAb fragments in bacterial cultures is a more cost-effective proposition than the production of full-length mAbs in insects or mammalian cell cultures.",
