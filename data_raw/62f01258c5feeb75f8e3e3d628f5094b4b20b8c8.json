Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is one of the natural anthraquinone derivatives obtained from the root and rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum. In the present study, the possibility of using emodin as a potential antiviral to treat CVB 4 infection was explored in vitro and in mice. Emodin reduced CVB 4 entry and replication on Hep-2 cells in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 12.06 \u03bcM and selectivity index (SI) of 5.08, respectively. The inhibitory effect of emodin for CVB 4 entry and replication was further confirmed by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) assay. The results further showed that the mice orally treated with different dosages of emodin displayed a dose dependent increase of survival rate, body weight and prolonged mean time of death (MTD), accompanied by significantly decreased myocardial virus titers and pathologic scores/lesions. Moreover, emodin could inhibit CVB 4 -induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that emodin could be used as potential antiviral in the post-exposure prophylaxis for CVB 4 infection.",

            "text": "Coxsackievirus B 4 (CVB 4 ) belongs to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae, and is one of six serotypes of the coxsackievirus B group. CVB 4 can cause a broad range of diseases, such as myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumonia and even death in neonates [1] . Moreover, clinical symptoms such as myopericarditis and pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) are still distinct and are associated only with CVB 4 infections [2] . Until now, there are no enterovirus-specific vaccines or therapeutic agents available for clinical usage of CVB 4 infection [3] . Current clinical therapeutic method and supportive treatment to reverse inflammation and alleviate the symptoms in many CVB 4 -infected patients has been still largely disappointing [4] . Although a great number of in vitro picornavirus replication inhibitors have been described, few of them have shown effectiveness in vivo [5] , and none has been approved for clinical use to date. Ribavirin may act as a lethal mutagen via incorporation into the viral RNA genome. In vitro activity of ribavirin against enteroviruses has been demonstrated by several groups [6] , and treatment of murine CVB 3 myocarditis led to significantly decreased myocardial virus titer, inflammation, necrosis and myocardial calcification [7] . One side effect of ribavirin, however, is drug resistance [8] , hemolytic anemia [9] , and it is licensed only for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus and hepatitis C virus infections [10] . Therefore, there is a need for an antiviral therapy which is effective for treating CVB 4 infection.",

A number of pharmacological properties including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anticancer, immunosuppressive, and chemopreventive effects have been suggested [12, 13] .

The separation of emodin was carried out on an Acclaim 120-C18 column (4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) with a mobile phase of methanol-water-0.1 phosphoric acid (85:15:0.05) under 30 \u00b0C. The flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was 289 nm. The calibration curves of emodin showed good linearity over the 0.0075~0.0214 mg/mL range (y = 3197.9930x + 43.4724, r = 0.9981). The emodin extracted from 50 g Polygonum cuspidatum is about 560.50 \u00b1 7.08 mg, or (11.21 \u00b1 0.14)% in terms of dried starting materials. The purity of emodin was (70.69 \u00b1 0.32)% in three independent experiments. We then tested the cytotoxicity of emodin on HEp-2 cells by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. As shown in Table 1 , the toxicity of emodin on HEp-2 cells was (61.35 \u00b1 4.44) \u03bcM, and the highest non-toxic concentration was around 46.26 \u03bcM. Several reports have shown that emodin is active against multiple viral infections. We initially tested the ability of emodin to inhibit CVB 4 entry and replication in HEp-2 cells. It has been reported that the CC 50 of emodin on HepG2.2.15 cells was 150.46 \u03bcM. The IC 50 against HBV was 77.71 \u03bcM [17] . Cells were first infected with CVB 4 and then treated with different concentrations of emodin. The virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was delayed dramatically by emodin in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 2a ). As shown in Table 1 , the EC 50 of emodin determined by the MTT and plaque reduction assay (PRA) were 14.10 \u00b1 0.74 \u03bcM and 12.06 \u00b1 1.85 \u03bcM, respectively. The selectivity indexes (SI) of emodin evaluated by MTT and PRA were 4.35 \u00b1 0.6 and 5.09 \u00b1 0.3, respectively. The inhibitory effect of emodin against CVB 4 infection was equivalent to that of the conventional antiviral ribavirin. There was no significant difference of SI between emodin-treated group and ribavirin-treated group (p > 0.05).",

The maximum inhibitory rate could be observed when emodin was added at 0-4 h postinfection when placed at 37 \u00b0C after inoculation (Figure 2b ). Published research by several other investigators has indicated that the mechanism of antiviral activity of emodin derived from other sources relies on direct inactivation of infectious viral particles [18, 19] . To investigate if emodin had a direct inactivation effect on CVB 4 particles, varying concentrations of emodin were incubated with CVB 4 for indicated times prior to inoculation on cells. However, no virucidal effect could be observed in our study, with the maximum inhibitory rate of emodin in virucidal assay being only about (8.26 \u00b1 0.3)%. No inhibitory activity was observed when cells were pre-incubated with various concentrations of emodin, since the inhibitory rate was only (7.35 \u00b1 0.2)%~(9.56 \u00b1 0.5)% at each dosage. There was no significant difference between emodin-treated groups and the virus control group in the direct inactivation and pre-incubation assay (p > 0.05). Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was then used to evaluate CVB 4 RNA levels. Figure 2c summarizes the number of copies obtained from different treatments after normalizing to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). It was observed that CVB 4 copies in the 37, 18.5, 9.0 \u03bcM emodin group expressed 0.77, 0.55 and 0.40-fold lower than the virus control group (p < 0.01), a result that corroborates the dose dependent inhibitory effect of emodin against CVB 4 infection. HEp-2 cells were seeded into 12-well culture plates and were infected with CVB 4 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to allow virus binding but not virus entry, the infected cells were treated or mock treated with emodin (37 \u03bcM) or ribavirin (512 \u03bcM) or 2% test medium at the indicated times intervals of 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h postinfection.

Treated groups were compared against those of controls using the relative quantification (2 \u2212 \u25b3\u25b3 T) method. The mRNA expression levels of caspase-3 in 30, 15, 7.5 mg/kg/d emodin treated groups were 0.57, 0.73, 0.9-fold and the bcl-2 levels were 2.37, 1.95, 1.18-fold, respectively, with respect to the expression in virus control (Figure 5d ).

Our results also implied that emodin may act as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB 4 infection rather than directly inactivating the viruses or blocking their absorption to the susceptible cells. The inhibitory effect of emodin on CVB 4 replication further confirmed by qPCR assay was equivalent that of the conventional antiviral ribavirin. Ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside, structurally related to inosine and guanosine, can induce lethal mutations when it is incorporated into viral RNA. The antimicrobial mechanisms of emodin, however, are still largely unknown. Previous studies have revealed that emodin may directly inhibit host cell casein kinase 2 (CK2), which is essential for the phosphorylation of some viral proteins [26, 27] . Moreover, the antiviral capacity of emodin against enveloped viruses is due to its affinity for phospholipid membrane and weakeness for hydrophobic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in phospholipid bilayers [13, 19] . Emodin can also inhibit the 3a ion channel of coronavirus SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 as well as virus release from HCoV-OC43 with a K 1/2 value of about 20 \u03bcM [16] . And emodin may exert its antiviral activity by direct inhibiting UL12 alkaline nuclease activity of HSV-1 [14, 28] . These findings suggest that emodin may be a potential antiviral candidate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities by targeting viruses or virus-related proteins. Apoptosis may play a primary role in the pathogenesis during viral infection. In our study, emodin could also mitigate CVB 4 -induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The rate of apoptosis in HEp-2 cells treated with emodin (18.5, 9 \u03bcM) was significantly lower than that of virus infected controls. There were no differences between 18.5 \u03bcM emodin and 512 \u03bcM ribavirin in inhibiting CVB 4 apoptosis. Furthermore, emodin could down-regulate the apoptosis-promoting gene caspase-3 while up-regulate the apoptosis-inhibiting gene Bcl-2 in murine heart tissues. In vivo orally administered emodin at 30, 15, 7.5 mg/kg/d significantly improved mice survival rate, prolonged the MTD, decreased HW/BW, virus titers and myocardial pathologic scores caused by virus infection. 30, 15 mg/kg/d emodin treatment was equivalent to 10 mg/kg/d ribavirin in alleviating the virus myocardial lesions. These properties added further appeal to emodin as a potential therapeutic agent against CVB 4 infection and therewith associated myocarditis.",
