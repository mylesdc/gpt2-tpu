The repositioning process involves lower risks and costs than the de novo development of novel antimicrobial drugs. Currently, infections by adenovirus show a steady increment with a high clinical impact in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The lack of a safe and efficacious drug to treat these infections supports the search for new antiviral drugs. Here we evaluated the anti-adenovirus activity of niclosanide, oxyclozanide, and rafoxanide, three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs. Also, we carried out the cytotoxicity evaluation and partial characterization of the mechanism of action of these drugs. The salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs showed significant anti-adenovirus activity at low micromolar concentrations with little cytotoxicity. Moreover, our mechanistic assays suggest differences in the way the drugs exert anti-adenovirus activity. Niclosamide and rafoxanide target transport of the HAdV particle from the endosome to the nuclear envelope, whilst oxyclozanide specifically targets adenovirus immediately early gene E1A transcription. Data suggests that the studied salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs could be suitable for further clinical evaluation for the development of new antiviral drugs to treat infections by adenovirus in immunosuppressed patients and in immunocompetent individuals with community-acquired pneumonia.",

In initial studies, we determined the inhibitory concentrations of the three anthelmintic drugs against HAdV in a plaque assay measured as the percentage of plaque formation inhibition compared to a control cells infected in the absence of drugs. The three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs showed a dose-dependent anti-HAdV activity against both HAdV5 and HAdV16, with 100% inhibition of plaques formation at 1.25, 5 and 2.5 \u03bcM for NIC, OXY and RAF, respectively ( Fig. 2a,b) . The IC 50 values for the three anthelmintic drugs are summarized in Table 1 . We also evaluated whether these salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs were able to inhibit virus production using HAdV5, HAdV16 and HAdV19 yield reduction assays. Treatment with NIC, OXY and RAF was associated with overall reductions in virus yield from 10 to 186-fold (Table 1) .",

Our results demonstrated that NIC, OXY and RAF exhibited a time-dependent decrease in their inhibitory activity (Fig. 4a) . All of them showed high inhibition of HAdV infection when added at the beginning of the 60 min incubation at 4 \u00b0C (\u221260 min), and when added immediately prior to warming (0 min) or after 10 min.

We next evaluated the ability of these salicylanilide drugs to block HAdV genome accessibility to the nucleus by the quantification of HAdV genomes isolated from the nucleus 22 . As reflected in Fig. 6a , only NIC and RAF showed a significant block in the accessibility of HAdV genomes to the nucleus (Fig. 6a) . The DNA copy number of the cellular gene GAPDH was also evaluated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as a control for the purity of nuclear isolation (data not shown).

HAdV DNA was extracted at that point to limit the interference caused by subsequent rounds of infection occurring 32-36 h post-infection 23 . We used quantitative PCR to quantify in a single round of infection the synthesis of new HAdV DNA copies as a measure of DNA replication efficiency. The presence of OXY (25 \u03bcM) significantly inhibited HAdV5 DNA replication by more than 50% (p < 0.05, Dunnett's Multiple Comparison test), whilst the quantification of the DNA copies of the GAPDH gene did not showed a significant effect (Fig. 6b ). This reduction in the HAdV DNA copy number at the nucleus in the presence of OXY implicated two alternatives for its mechanism of action: i) OXY could inhibit HAdV DNA replication by interfering with a protein required in this process like HAdV DNA polymerase, DNA binding protein (DBP) or terminal protein (TP) or, alternatively, ii) OXY could impact transcription of the HAdV immediate early gene E1A, which is a key step before DNA replication.",

Moreover, we included in our evaluation other two chlorinated salicylanilide anthelmintic derivatives approved for animal use, OXY and RAF, because of their closely related structure and mechanism of action with NIC. It is well-known that these drugs act as uncouplers of the oxidative phosphorylation, involving dissipation of the membrane potential 28 . In case of NIC, Jurgeitr et al. 14 previously demonstrated that its antiviral mechanism of action was specifically associated with the neutralization of the endosomal pH, thus showing a broad antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses. Although HAdV endosomal escape is not exclusively dependent of pH, a low pH has proven to be associated with the endosomal escape of HAdV 20, 29 . With these premises, we initially assumed a probable common anti-HAdV mechanism of action for these three drugs and decided to characterize their anti-HAdV activity as a previous step before the evaluation of their safety and efficacy in the Syrian hamster model of HAdV infection.",

            "text": "Here, we show that NIC, OXY and RAF exert significant anti-HAdV and anti-HCMV activity at low concentrations. To put this data into perspective, it is noteworthy that the reported IC 50 values for cidofovir, the drug of choice for the treatment of HAdV infections, are higher than those shown by these three salicylanilide drugs 30, 31 . In addition, following our own methodologies, the IC 50 value for cidofovir was 24.06 \u00b1 5.9 \u00b5M, significantly higher than the values obtained for the three salicylanilide drugs. As for their mechanism of action, the data obtained from this work demonstrates that one of these three closely-related drugs did not share the expected mode of action. We have confirmed in our work that NIC, and as a novelty RAF, acts to decrease the number of HAdV genomes associated with the host nucleus, however, as demonstrated by our physiologic assay using the ribotoxin \u03b1-sarcin NIC and RAF may act in a later step after HAdV endosomal escape. Unlike NIC and RAF, OXY did not inhibit the access of HAdV genomes to the nucleus. This observation was confirmed in their time-course assay where we found that, for NIC and RAF inhibition occurred at earliest times of the HAdV replicative cycle than for OXY as well as in the western-blot assay at 6 hpi that showed higher inhibition of the E1A gene expression for NIC and RAF. As shown by our results, the high inhibition in the HAdV DNA replication generated by OXY may be the consequence of the previous and significant inhibition of the E1A gene transcription, which is supported by our results showing a clear inhibition of the E1A transcription at 6 hpi, both by quantitative real-time PCR and by western-blot. It is well known that prior to HAdV DNA replication, transcription of E1A by cellular RNA polymerase II takes place from the E1A promoter 32 . Then, E1A protein promotes its own transcription and is needed for the subsequent expression of the early genes E1B, E2, E3 and E4 from different promoters as well as for DNA replication and that is probably why we observed that significant inhibition on HAdV DNA replication. The existence of different mechanisms for the antiviral activity of these three drugs is supported by the significant combinatory index values obtained using the CalcuSyn software for all the drug combinations ( Table 2 ). The three anthelmintic drugs showed a moderate synergistic to a strong synergistic activity when they were combined in pairs, which was especially strong at all the levels of inhibition evaluated for the NIC-OXY combination. Likewise, using the combination of the three of them they showed a strong synergistic activity at all the levels of inhibition evaluated.",

In case of NIC and other anthelmintic drugs, numerous reports support their repurposing as anti-cancer drugs due to their cancer inhibitory properties [37] [38] [39] [40] . NIC is an FDA-approved drug that has been used for many years to treat helminthic infections in humans and has previously demonstrated its antiviral potential against different viruses such as Japanese encephalitis flavivirus, zika virus, coronavirus, human rhinovirus or influenza virus [14] [15] [16] [17] . In rats, NIC is known to exert low in vivo toxicity, with a median lethal dose 50% (LD 50 ) of 5,000 mg/kg body weight and generate peak serum concentrations between 1.08 \u00b5M and 25 \u00b5M, depending on the dose and the administration route 40, 41 . In healthy humans orally treated with 750-2,000 mg NIC per person, no signs of intoxication were seen 42 , and the drug remained detectable for 1-2 days. Peak serum concentrations between 0.8-18 \u00b5M were reported 42, 43 . As shown in our results, these serum concentrations will be enough to reach the IC 50 for HAdV (Table 1) . OXY and RAF are other FDA-approved drugs for veterinary use to treat helminthic infections. For OXY, high serum concentrations ranging from 12.26 \u00b5M to 41.69 \u00b5M have been reported in sheep and goats after a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg 44 . In the case of RAF, an intravenous single dose of 10 mg/kg in goats generated serum concentrations ranging from 2.8 \u00b5M to 139.98 \u00b5M registered at 0.08 h and 12 h, respectively 45 . After a single oral dose of 22.5 mg/kg also in goats, the maximum serum concentrations obtained were 49.33 \u00b5M and 21.40 \u00b5M at 36 h and 168 h, respectively 45 . In both cases, OXY and RAF serum concentrations are significantly higher than their IC 50 for HAdV ( Table 1) . As for their toxicity, LD 50 of RAF has been reported to be higher than 2,000 mg/kg of body weight in rats while for OXY, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), this LD 50 would be higher than 3,000 mg/kg of body weight (also in rats) 46 .",

NIC and RAF would mainly block HAdV infection at some point between endosomal escape and DNA release into the nucleus, whilst the activity of OXY would be specifically targeting HAdV immediately early gene E1A transcription. Our findings support the evaluation of these three drugs in the Syrian hamster model of HAdV infection to evaluate their efficacy and safety. The pharmacokinetic profile of these salicylanilide drugs showing low water solubility and oral bioavailability may hamper its further clinical development 39 . In this situation, the generation of derivatives of these salicylanilide drugs based on rational chemical approaches may improve their poor pharmacokinetics, increasing their solubility and bioavailability as potential clinical candidates for antiviral therapy. Wild-type HAdV5 (species C), HAdV16 (species B), HAdV19 (species D), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) AD169 were obtained from the ATCC. The HAdV5-GFP and HAdV16-GFP used in this study are replication-defective viruses with a CMV promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter gene cassette in place of the E1/E3 region 48 . HAdV were propagated in 293\u03b25 cells and isolated from the cellular lysate by cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient combined with ultracentrifugation. Virus concentration in mg/ mL was calculated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and converted to virus particles/mL (vp/mL) using 4 \u00d7 10 12 vp/mg. Cytotoxicity assay. NIC, OXY and RAF cytotoxicity was evaluated using the Alamar Blue Cell Viability Assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Actively dividing A549 or 293\u03b25 cells were incubated with the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs for 48 h. After this incubation, the Alamar Blue Reagent was added to the cells (1/10th Alamar Blue Reagent in culture medium) for an extra 4 h. Their 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated as previously reported by Cheng et al. 49 . The selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the ratio of CC 50 to IC 50 , where the IC 50 is defined as the concentration of the anthelmintic drug that inhibits HAdV infection by 50%.",

CalcuSyn software interpolates the drugs concentrations needed in combination at the selected ratio to generate effects of 50%, 75% and 90% inhibition and compares these combined drug concentrations with the concentrations from the three drugs' individual dose-response curves required to achieve the same inhibition. The combination effect of the three drugs was reported by the combination index (CI) value, a quantitative estimation of the pharmacological interaction which uses the potency (IC 50 ) and the shape of the dose-response curve of each individual drug and their combinations.

Three-fold serial dilutions (333-0.15 ng) of Ad5ts1 or wild-type HAdV5 were preincubated with cells in the presence of 5 \u03bcM NIC or 25 \u03bcM OXY and RAF, or the same volume of DMSO (negative control) for 1 h on ice. Then, the medium was removed and replaced with 50 ml DMEM-containing 0.1 mg/ml of \u03b1-sarcin (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) and the virus/ drug mixtures, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kits (Invitrogen) was used to analyse protein synthesis according to the manufacturer's instructions. The incorporation of the amino acid analog of methionine L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) containing Alexa Fluor 488 azide was measured using a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and calculated subtracting the background level of the control well containing L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) and \u03b1-sarcin but not virus (100% incorporation).",
