Virchow conducted experimental animal studies on Trichinella spiralis in porcine muscular tissue and cysticercosis and tuberculosis in cattle; he coined the term \"zoonosis\" and stated, \"between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines -nor should there be.\" Osler, who studied in Berlin with, and was influenced by Virchow, helped promote \"One Health\" as he taught veterinary pathology at Montreal Veterinary College, and established veterinary pathology as an academic discipline in North America.",

Veterinary medical school students usually receive considerably more exposure to parasitology than do human medical school students. This is largely due to the much greater volume of endoparasite (and ectoparasite) infections and infection rates for animals vis-\u00e0-vis humans. Thus, epidemiologic prevention, diagnosis, control and treatment needs of animals exceed those for humans.

Sanaria's approach \"deploys a weakened form of the whole malaria parasite harvested from irradiated mosquitoes instead of small portions of the parasite.\" ... \"While most malaria vaccines in clinical development consist of recombinant or genetically engineered proteins that represent small portions of the parasite, Sanaria's Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine candidate contains a weakened form of the entire malaria parasite.\" The Sanaria vaccine currently requires liquid nitrogen transport and storage, which poses challenges for widespread use in Africa.An example of \"One Health in Action\" was a recent outreach to the veterinary medical community by Monath, one of the co-authors of this editorial in an effort to ascertain methods for vaccine storage and transport. The idea was to investigate and compare how veterinary vaccines were handled and if utilizing or incorporating some of these methods might be utilized and provide better transportation of the human malaria vaccines. A request for information on the distribution of veterinary vaccines using liquid nitrogen placed on the One Health Initiative website resulted in many potentially useful responses from industry and academia.Medical professionals and health scientists must include parasitologists, microbiologists, physiologists, pathologist, physicians, osteopaths, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, biomedical engineers, physicists, biochemists, plant pathologists and others. Anyone capable of contributing should be considered important and co-equal without reservations.One Health has indeed become the \"Rosetta Stone\" for a health enlightening paradigm shift revolution. It is the critical key that translates difficult problem solving into less difficult models. It presents a means for the health scientific communities to move towards a more panoramic view, a sustainable revolution (described as an environmental definition for our civilization to survive) and the pursuit of altruistic excellence, notwithstanding respecta-ble status quo advancements of the past.
