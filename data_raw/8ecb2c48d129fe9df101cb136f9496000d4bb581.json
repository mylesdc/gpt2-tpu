            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the kidney proximal tubule, where it cleaves angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). Urinary ACE2 levels increase in diabetes, suggesting that ACE2 may be shed from tubular cells. The aim of this study was to determine if ACE2 is shed from proximal tubular cells, to characterize ACE2 fragments, and to study pathways for shedding. Studies involved primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells, with ACE2 activity measured using a synthetic substrate, and analysis of ACE2 fragments by immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The culture media from mouse proximal tubular cells demonstrated a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity, suggesting constitutive ACE2 shedding. ACE2 was detected in media as two bands at ,90 kDa and ,70 kDa on immunoblots. By contrast, full-length ACE2 appeared at ,100 kDa in cell lysates or mouse kidney cortex. Mass spectrometry of the two deglycosylated fragments identified peptides matching mouse ACE2 at positions 18-706 and 18-577, respectively. The C-terminus of the 18-706 peptide fragment contained a non-tryptic site, suggesting that Met 706 is a candidate ACE2 cleavage site. Incubation of cells in high D-glucose (25 mM) (and to a lesser extent Ang II) for 48-72 h increased ACE2 activity in the media (p,0.001), an effect blocked by inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. High D-glucose increased ADAM17 activity in cell lysates (p,0.05). These data indicate that two glycosylated ACE2 fragments are constitutively shed from mouse proximal tubular cells. ACE2 shedding is stimulated by high D-glucose, at least partly via an ADAM17-mediated pathway. The results suggest that proximal tubular shedding of ACE2 may increase in diabetes, which could enhance degradation of Ang II in the tubular lumen, and increase levels of Ang-(1-7).",

Although ACE2 is found in many tissues, it is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule (PT) [3, 4] . Experimental studies suggest that ACE2 protects against renal disease progression. Thus, ACE2 gene knockout (KO) mice develop accelerated Ang II-mediated glomerulosclerosis [5] and are more susceptible to kidney injury in the type 1 diabetes Akita model [6] . Moreover, in Akita diabetic mice, administration of exogenous human recombinant ACE2 attenuates blood pressure and glomerular injury [7] . We recently reported that podocytespecific overexpression of human ACE2 attenuates streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy in mice [8] . In kidney biopsies from patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, glomerular and tubular expression of ACE2 is decreased, which may result in increased Ang II levels and subsequent enhanced renal injury [9] . In contrast, mice with diabetic nephropathy exhibit diminished glomerular ACE2 expression, but increased tubular ACE2, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to counteract the effects of increased Ang II [3, 10] .",

Briefly, kidneys were harvested aseptically from anesthetized mice, and renal cortices were dissected, gently minced, and suspended in a perfusion solution consisting of (in mM) 105 NaCl, 24 NaHCO 3 , 5.0 KCl, 2.0 Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.0 MgSO 4 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 4.0 Na lactate, 5.0 D-glucose, 1.0 L-alanine, 10 N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% collagenase (type V; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), pH 7.2. The suspension was gassed with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 for 30 min at 37uC. After collagenase digestion, the cortical suspension was strained through a 250 mm brass sieve and centrifuged at 1500 g for 1 min. The pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in a 40% Percoll solution (Sigma) (pH 7.2) containing (in mM) 120 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 1.0 MgCl 2 , 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 5.0 D-glucose, 10 HEPES, 1.0 L-alanine, 1.4 CaCl 2 , 60 U/ml penicillin, and 60 mg/ml streptomycin. The solution was centrifuged at 18500 g for 30 min at 4uC, and the digested tissue separated into four distinct bands. The fourth band (F4), enriched in PT segments, was aspirated, suspended in culture medium and centrifuged to remove the Percoll solution. For 2 mice, the final PT pellet was suspended in culture medium and seeded onto 32 35-mm culture dishes.",

            "text": "Primary cultures of PT cells derived from ACE2 KO mice were transiently transfected with a human ACE2 expression vector (HA-hACE2), in which the cDNA encoding the full-length human ACE2 gene was cloned into the XhoI restriction site of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [8] . As a negative control, some cells were transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector. One day prior to transfection, subconfluent PT cells (50-70%) were placed in defined medium without antibiotics. Cells were then transiently transfected with 3.75 mg of HA-hACE2 plasmid or empty pcDNA3 vector on 35-mm culture dishes, using Lipofectamine TM LTX reagent, as per the supplier protocol (Invitrogen), and after 48 hrs, ACE2 activity or protein expression in cell lysates and culture medium was assayed. The time point of 48 hrs for measurement of ACE2 activity was chosen based on preliminary experiments, in which transient transfection of PT cells derived from wild-type mice with HA-hACE2 resulted in significant increases in ACE2 activity in the media after 48 hrs (p,0.001 vs untransfected controls or cells transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector; n = 3), but no detectable increase in activity at 72, 96 or 120 hrs. ACE2 enzymatic activity assay ACE2 activity in cell culture media and membrane fractions was measured using a commercially available synthetic fluorogenic substrate for ACE2 (Mca-Ala-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-OH) (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA, USA), essentially as described [15, 17, 21] . Cell media was collected, followed by addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail (1% vol/vol) (Sigma, P8340). For all experiments, media was first centrifuged at 9300 g for 5 min at 4uC to remove dead cells and cellular debris. The cell membrane fraction from PT cells was isolated as previously described [8] . Cell media (15 mL) or membrane fractions (1-2 mg) were then added to the wells of a 96-well plate (total volume 100 mL/well) in a solution containing 37.5 mM MES, 225 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM ZnCl 2 , 0.75 mM Nethylmaleimide (NEM), 0.75 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 11.25 mM ACE2 substrate, with or without 1 mM of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (GL1001, provided by Ore Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA). In this assay, MLN-4760 consistently caused at least 95% inhibition of ACE2 activity in conditioned media samples (see Table S1 ). Samples were protected from light and incubated for 16 hrs on a plate shaker at room temperature and fluorescence was measured using the FLUOstar Galaxy fluorometer (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC, USA) with excitation wavelength of 320 nM and emission wavelength of 405 nM. Preliminary experiments determined that for time points up to 16 hrs of incubation with ACE2 fluorogenic substrate, the linear range of detection for mouse recombinant ACE2 was between 1.56-50 ng/ml (R 2 = 0.9976, p,0.001). Further experiments determined that using this assay, ACE2 activity in media samples from primary cultures of mouse PT cells was linear for at least 24 hrs of incubation with the fluorogenic substrate ( Figure  S1 ), and therefore 16 hrs of incubation was chosen for data collection. ACE2 activity was determined by subtracting the Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU) obtained in the presence of MLN-4760 from the reading in the absence of inhibitor. ACE2 activity in the culture medium was corrected for the cell protein amounts on the culture dishes, and is reported as RFUs per mg protein per hour (RFU/mg/hr).",

In primary cultures of mouse PT cells, a time-dependent increase in ACE2 enzymatic activity was detected in the media, suggesting constitutive shedding ( Figure 1 ). As shown in Figure 2A , in lysates from primary cultures of mouse PT cells, ACE2 was detected as a protein of ,100 kDa by immunoblot, consistent with its size as detected in mouse kidney cortex [23] . However, in concentrated media from mouse PT cells, immunoblot analysis revealed 2 fragments for ACE2, at ,90 kDa and ,70 kDa. Further experiments determined if ACE2 fragments could be shed from PT cells derived from ACE2 gene KO mice, transfected with a plasmid expressing the human ACE2 cDNA. ACE2 was not detected by immunoblot in either cell lysates or media from untransfected PT cells derived from ACE2 KO mice. By contrast, transfection with the human ACE2 plasmid resulted in detection of the expected single band for human ACE2 at ,120 kDa in cell lysates [17] , while the cell media contained 2 bands at ,110 kDa and ,95 kDa ( Figure 2A ). Furthermore, while untransfected cells and cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3 plasmid demonstrated no measurable ACE2 activity in the media, cells transfected with the human ACE2 cDNA had significant levels of ACE2 activity in the media after 48 hrs ( Figure 2B ; P,0.001 vs untransfected control or empty pcDNA3 vector; n = 4).",

The C-terminal amino acid was Arg 577 , corresponding to a tryptic cleavage site. The cleavage site for this ACE2 fragment is therefore predicted to be located at or C-terminal to Arg 577 and could occur before Lys 596 , the next Cterminal tryptic cleavage site. In 1 of 6 experiments, LC-MS/MS analysis detected a C-terminal Lys 619 (a tryptic cleavage site), corresponding to an ACE2 fragment with predicted molecular mass of 69.6 kDa. For this fragment, the cleavage site could lie between Lys 619 and Arg 644 , since Arg 644 is the next C-terminal site accessible to tryptic digestion. Alternative proteases (chymotrypsin and glutamyl endopeptidase) were used, but peptides representing the region of interest between Arg 577 and Lys 596 were not identified with this strategy (data not shown). A summary of the sequence data for the 2 main ACE2 shed fragments (deglycosylated 75 kDa and 60 kDa fragments) identified by LC-MS/MS is shown in Figure 6 . Figure S2 ). The stimulatory effect of Ang II on ACE2 activity in the culture media was blocked by co-incubation with losartan (10 25 M) suggesting that binding of Ang II to PT AT 1 receptors is required to mediate this effect ( Figure S3 ). As an osmotic control, incubation of cells in L-glucose (25 mM) had no effect on ACE2 activity in the media. Furthermore, addition of D-glucose (25 mM) to media without cell incubation had no effect on ACE2 activity (n = 3, not shown). Incubation of PT cells in high D-glucose (25 mM) for 72 hrs did not significantly affect ACE2 activity in the cell membrane fraction, compared to cells in 7.8 mM D-glucose (not shown, n = 8).",

            "text": "ACE2 is an 805-amino acid type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is localized mainly to the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells [14] . As a terminal carboxypeptidase, ACE2 consists of a N-glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain that contains the active site (amino acids 1-740), a hydrophobic transmembrane region (amino acids 741-762), and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 763-805) [13] . Cell surface abundance of transmembrane proteins may decrease as a result of ectodomain shedding, which may be mediated by proteolytic cleavage at specific amino acid sites. Constitutive ectodomain shedding of soluble ACE2 has been demonstrated in a variety of cultured cells, including ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells and endogenous ACE2-expressing Huh7 cells [11] , human airway epithelial cells [13] , ACE2-transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells [12] and mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with adenovirus encoding ACE2 [12] . We observed a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity in the media of unstimulated mouse PT cells, associated with the appearance of two ACE2 fragments on immunoblots. These data indicate that ACE2 is constitutively shed from mouse PT cells, and indeed we also observed constitutive shedding from PT cells derived from ACE2 KO mice that had been transiently transfected with a human ACE2 cDNA expression vector, by immunoblot and enzymatic activity assay.",

Lambert et al. first reported that ADAM17 mediated the proteolytic cleavage of human ACE2 in HEK293 and endogenous ACE2 in Huh7 cells, with release of 2 soluble glycosylated fragments of size 105 kDa and 95 kDa [11] . Phorbol ester-stimulated release of ACE2 was blocked by inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-1, and by generalized metalloprotease inhibition with the hydroxymatebased inhibitor GM6001 [11] . TAPI-1 has also been shown to significantly inhibit phorbol ester-stimulated ACE2 shedding in ACE2-transfected CHO cells, with little effect on constitutive shedding [28] . In ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells, basal shedding of ACE2 was not significantly affected by either TAPI-1 or GM6001 [11] . By contrast, constitutive shedding of soluble ACE2 in human airway epithelial cells is reduced by ADAM17 inhibition, as is phorbol ester-stimulated release, suggesting a prominent role for ADAM17 in ACE2 cleavage in these cells [13] . Interestingly, in our studies TAPI-1 completely blocked high glucose-stimulated shedding of ACE2 from PT cells, and caused a partial inhibition of Ang II-stimulated ACE2 shedding. TAPI-1 had no effect on constitutive ACE2 release. The ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 also inhibited high glucose-stimulated ACE2 shedding from PT cells. In contrast, generalized metalloproteinase inhibition with GM6001 had no impact on constitutive ACE2 shedding, and did not significantly inhibit high glucose-stimulated shedding. Our data therefore suggest that basal ACE2 shedding in PT cells is mediated by other protease(s), or by a relative lack of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [11] . Indeed, since the inhibitors used in this study are not highly selective, our data support a possible role for ADAMs and metalloproteinases in the shedding of ACE2 from PT cells.",

The glycosylated fragments ran at ,90 kDa and ,70 kDa on gels, and collectively, they retained ACE2 enzymatic activity. Although we did not determine the differential enzymatic activity of the fragments, the presence of the ACE2 ectodomain in each sequence predicts retention of ACE2 activity. In support of this hypothesis, Iwata et al. demonstrated that deglycosylated soluble shed fragments of human ACE2 at ,80 kDa and ,70 kDa each retained equivalent ACE2 enzymatic activities [12] . Our results are not the first to suggest that ACE2 fragments may be shed from renal tubular cells.

Chodavarapu et al. reported ACE2 fragments of molecular size 90 kDa and 70 kDa in urines from db/db mice, with the larger band corresponding to that observed on immunblots of kidney lysates [19] .

ACE2 fragments were identified beginning at Gln 18 , consistent with the presence of a 17-amino acid signal peptide sequence at the Nterminus [2] . In unstimulated cells, the long soluble fragment was shown to contain a Met 706 at the C-terminal position (not subject to tryptic digestion). This site was found in one experiment, while 3 other, separate samples identified a trypsin-sensitive Arg 705 at the C-terminus. Similarly, in stimulated cells, the C-terminal amino acid of the long fragment was identified as Arg 705 in 3 separate experiments. Using a series of synthesized peptides corresponding to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of human ACE2, Lai et al. reported that Arg 708 and Arg 710 may play roles in site recognition for ACE2 shedding mediated by ADAM17 [28] . A putative cleavage site for ADAM17-mediated shedding was identified at the bond Arg 708 -Ser 709 in human ACE2 [28] . While the mouse ACE2 amino acid sequence contains conserved residues at Arg 708 and Arg 710 , Arg 708 is followed by Gly 709 , suggesting that species-specific cleavage sites may exist. In this regard, further studies directed at LC-MS/MS analysis of ACE2 fragments in media from ACE2 KO cells stably transfected with the human ACE2 cDNA vector could provide supportive information. Our data support Met 706 as a potential cleavage site, although we cannot rule out the possibility for other cleavage sites in proximity (including Arg 705 ), since these would generate fragments that might not be distinguishable on gel electrophoresis.",

ADAM17 has some selectivity for aliphatic hydrophobic residues at the P19 position (immediately downstream of the cleavage site), and the P19 amino acid for Arg 577 is Asn 578 (a hydrophilic residue), although considerable variability exists in substrate recognition sites [29] . Jia et al. have reported that mutation of Leu 584 in human ACE2 to Ala 584 prevents shedding, suggesting that this represents a sheddase ''recognition motif'' [13] .

Mice with diabetes exhibit increased kidney expression of ADAM17 and ACE2, associated with high levels of urinary ACE2 activity and shedding of ACE2 fragments [15, 19] . In humans, increased urinary ACE2 levels are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, and are predictive of microalbuminuria, suggesting that urinary ACE2 may be a biomarker of early diabetic nephropathy [18] . Consistent with these observations, in our studies high glucose stimulated PT cell ADAM17 activity, and led to increased ACE2 shedding. By contrast, Ang II did not significantly increase ADAM17 activity, although TAPI-1 partly inhibited Ang II-stimulated ACE2 shedding. In this regard, the effect of Ang II on ACE2 shedding was relatively minor, and any increases in ADAM17 activity induced by Ang II may have been below the limits of detectability in the enzyme assay. Taken together, our results suggest that increases in luminal ACE2 activity occur in the diabetic kidney, stimulated by high glucose and Ang II. Shed ACE2 could serve to dampen levels of Ang II in the PT lumen, and increase Ang-(1-7) production. On the other hand, ectodomain shedding of ACE has been shown to occur in polarized renal epithelial cells [14] , and N-domain ACE fragments are present in human urine and may associate with hypertension [30] . Although we did not study PT ACE shedding, it is intriguing to speculate that the relative balance between shed ACE2 and ACE fragments could regulate local levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in the urinary space.",
