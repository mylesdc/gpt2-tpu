We here use a drug repositioning strategy and identify a promising anticryptosporidial drug candidate. Screening a library of benzoxaboroles comprised of analogs to four antiprotozoal chemical scaffolds under preclinical development for neglected tropical diseases for Cryptosporidium growth inhibitors identifies the 6-carboxamide benzoxaborole AN7973. AN7973 blocks intracellular parasite development, appears to be parasiticidal, and potently inhibits the two Cryptosporidium species most relevant to human health, C. parvum and C. hominis. It is efficacious in murine models of both acute and established infection, and in a neonatal dairy calf model of cryptosporidiosis. AN7973 also possesses favorable safety, stability, and PK parameters, and therefore, is an exciting drug candidate for treating cryptosporidiosis.",

A recent multicenter study of life threatening diarrhea conducted in the Indian subcontinent and Sub-Saharan Africa found that the little-studied apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium, predominantly either Cryptosporidium parvum or Cryptosporidium hominis, is amongst the two or three most important causes of childhood diarrhea 2, 3 . Cryptosporidiosis is also strongly associated with child malnutrition and developmental stunting 4, 5 . Cryptosporidium parasites were previously best known as a frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised people, such as those with AIDS or following organ transplantation, and in the United States they account for more than 85% of waterborne diarrheal disease for which a pathogen is identified [6] [7] [8] . Cryptosporidiosis is also a large economic concern for beef and milk producers, and infection of cattle may contribute to contamination of water supplies and human outbreaks 9, 10 . In a nationwide survey of farms in the United States, C. parvum was present on more than 50% of dairy farms, and 48% of all calves aged 1-3 weeks were infected 9 . Despite the public health and economic impacts of Cryptosporidium, there is no preventive vaccine and treatment options for both humans and cattle are limited. The only approved treatment, nitazoxanide, reduces the duration of diarrhea in immunocompetent adults, but is only moderately effective in children and is equivalent to a placebo in immunocompromised patients [11] [12] [13] . Its activity in dairy calves is controversial and at best marginal 14, 15 . New anti-Cryptosporidium drugs are urgently needed, and several promising drug leads have been reported recently [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

AN7973 had no activity in an assay for C. parvum invasion of HCT-8 host cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It predominantly affected intracellular Cryptosporidium development, since it arrested new DNA synthesis as reflected by inhibition of incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2\u2032deoxyuridine (EdU) into newly synthesized DNA (Fig. 2c) potency in reducing the percent of parasites expressing the meiotic recombination protein DMC1, which is a biomarker for Cryptosporidium sexual development 38 . Unlike some compounds, e.g., the piperazine-based lead MMV665917, that have equal potency against asexual and sexual stage parasites 38 , AN7973 inhibited asexual parasite growth four times more potently than asexual-stage to sexual-stage differentiation (Fig. 2d) , which was felt to be consistent with its effect on intracellular replication. Treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised individuals such as malnourished children, AIDS patients, and transplant patients might be expected to require a parasiticidal compound. Consistent with this hypothesis, C. parvum time-kill curve assays showed that the approved drug nitazoxanide, which is effective in immunocompetent adults but equivalent to a placebo in AIDS patients, is likely parasitistatic or very slow acting (Fig. 3a) 19 . Time-kill curve data were referenced to the vehicle control for each time point in order to isolate the effect of compounds from the spontaneous decline in C. parvum numbers that occurs after 24 to 48 h of in vitro culture. This demonstrated the absence of nitazoxanide-dependent parasite elimination (Fig. 3b) . AN7973, on the other hand, appeared to act rapidly and drove progressive elimination of C. parvum in vitro in the absence of immune pressure (Fig. 3c, d) . In vitro parasite elimination in the presence of AN7973 was exponential with a half-life of \u223c9.2 h, and \u223c92 h required for 99.9% parasite reduction. The maximum rate of parasite elimination was achieved at \u223c3 \u00d7 EC 90 (0.63 \u00b5M).",

In the mouse study, concentrations of AN7973 in feces generally increased over the 16 h period following oral dosing but were highly variable ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). In calves dosed orally, considerably lower variability was observed between animals, and concentrations of AN7973 remained high through the entire 168 h observation period ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ).",

Mice infected with C. parvum do not develop diarrhea, but neonatal dairy calves infected with C. parvum develop a self-limited illness much like that seen in infants and characterized by severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, and fecal oocyst shedding 42 . We therefore used a neonatal calf model to test the effect of AN7973 treatment on diarrhea and dehydration, in addition to its effect on parasite shedding. For this, an initial small efficacy study was conducted during which the effect of infection on PK was also assessed. These data were then used to guide the design of additional dosing regimens (Fig. 5a) . One-day-old to two-day-old bull calves were infected by oral administration of \u223c5 \u00d7 10 7 C. parvum Bunch Grass Farms Iowa isolate oocysts. Fecal parasite shedding was measured daily using qPCR, and the animals were assessed clinically at least twice daily for diarrhea, hydration status, appetite, and overall health status. Clinical observations were quantified using previously described scales ranging from 1 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal) for fecal consistency, overall health status, hydration status, and appetite (see Supplementary Table 2) All calves tolerated AN7973 well, based on at least twice daily assessment of alertness, interaction with caregivers, and appetite (see Supplementary Table 2 (Fig. 5b, d and e) . Once daily 10 mg per kg AN7973 also reduced peak parasite shedding and diarrhea. However, despite equal or better mean plasma exposures in animals treated with once daily 10 mg per kg vs. twice daily 5 mg per kg AN7973, fecal parasite shedding resumed and persisted in the once daily treated animals (Fig. 5b) . Based on these data, it was unlikely that plasma exposures alone were driving efficacy, suggesting that gastrointestinal exposure to AN7973 was important.",

In addition to efficacy in mouse models of both acute and established infection, AN7973 reduced C. parvum fecal shedding, diarrhea, and dehydration in a neonatal calf model in which disease closely mimics that seen in infants.

Furthermore, related HAT and AAT lead compounds, also 6-amides like AN7973, target Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 3 (CPSF3), an endonuclease that functions in mRNA processing 46 . It is known that other oxaboroles inhibit CPSF3 in Plasmodium falciparum 28 , and Cryptosporidium CPSF3 is greater than 40% identical to that of P. falciparum at the amino acid level.

A TK study was performed in parallel to determine exposure, using 3 vehicle control animals and 6 experimental animals dosed 80 mg per kg AN7973 by oral gavage once daily for 7 consecutive days. Serum was collected from vehicle-control animals at 1 h and 4 h after dosing on days 1 and 7. The AN7973 recipient group was divided into two, with serum collected according to the following schedule: first 3 of 6 animals (pre-dose, 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 72 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (72 h time point day 7 only)); and second 3 of 6 animals (0.5 h, 2 h, 8 h, 48 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (48 h time point day 7 only)). Following completion of blood collection, TK animals were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and exsanguination without necropsy. AN7973 was quantified using a qualified liquid chromatographic triple quadruple mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method that had a lower limit of quantification of \u22645 ng per mL.",
