At lower TPCK concentration (3-10 \u03bcg/inoculum), no changes at the cellular level were observed, while cells activated with 25-30 \u03bcg of trypsin/inoculums, they degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced. Appreciable changes in cell's morphology were detected with optimal trypsin concentration of 15-20 \u03bcg trypsin/inoculums. Data from qRT-PCR confirmed that unsuccessful cultivations have No-Ct, and all nine isolates have Ct values ranged between 12.17 and 24.69.

            "text": "Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are a member of the family Reoviridae, genus Rotavirus. RVA infect both animals [18] and humans [5] , and cause an acute gastroenteritis (AGE) accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The genome of these viruses is composed of 11 segments of dsRNA and is surrounded by three concentric layers of proteins [9] . The outermost layer is formed by two proteins, VP4 and VP7. Dimers of VP4 form spikes that extend from the virus surface and have essential functions in the virus life-cycle, including receptor binding and cell penetration [9] . The diagnosis of RVA was initially based on electron microscopy [10] , ELISA [23] , RNA electrophoresis [21] , nucleic acid hybridization [19] , immunofluorescence (IF), the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11] , or recently the quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) [20] . These tests while faster, highly sensitive and specific present some limits. They require subsequent virus isolation for the evaluation of agent infectivity. Indeed, virus isolation remains the gold standard test to recover the viral particles from clinical fecal samples, to determine their behavior in tissue culture and to measure their infectivity. In addition, isolation remains the basic assay to provide antigens that can be used as successful immunogenics to raise prominent antibodies which can be useful for the construction and development of a wide variety of immunoassays (rapid immunochromatographic strip test, microneutralization assays (SNT), ELISA, IF or qRT-PCR standards). Thus, the direct cultivation method would be necessary when large numbers of samples need to be analyzed during epidemiological surveys, vaccine trials or when further sensitivity is required. Moreover, efficient and accurate isolation of RVA is of primary importance for pathogenesis, vaccine development and academic research.",

We realized that hemagglutination (HA) of chicken erythrocytes by RVA particles decreased three to eight folds when a sample is freeze-thawed at room temperature and the loss of HA was irreversible after three rounds of freeze-thaw (data not shown). This observation, although reported not to alter the virus morphology [3, 4] , is consistent with earlier biological studies suggesting that effective HA of a RVA strain may increase its infectivity and therefore, RVA isolation [15] . Indeed, HA phenotype of RVA is mediated by the VP4 gene which was clearly shown to code for protease enhanced plaque formation in MA104 cells [15] . This VP4 gene, was also shown to be protease-sensitive. It is cleaved to VP5 (60 kDa) and VP8* (28 kDa) in the presence of trypsin, resulting in the conversion of noninfectious rotavirus to an infectious form [7, 8] .",

The results demonstrate that at lower concentration (i.e., 3-10 \u03bcg of trypsin), no changes at the cellular level were observed ( Fig. 1a) after six passages and samples were considered negative for RVA isolation. On the contrary, cells activated as well as controls degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced with 25-30 \u03bcg of trypsin (Fig. 1b, c) . In parallel, when samples were assayed with 15-20 \u03bcg of trypsin for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C (or 2 h at room temperature) (data not shown), appreciable changes in cell's morphology were detected 2-3 days post infection (pif ) (Fig. 1d) .

This is explained by the fact that infected cells were not washed sufficiently to remove FCS which inhibits trypsin and not to their initial HA titers. Indeed, RVA strains from 2/12 and 7/T having the same HA titers (1/64 and 1/8 respectively) as 2/23 and 1/25 samples were successfully isolated when infected cells were adequately washed (Table 1) . Also, other factors were interfering with successful isolation such the infectious viral titer in the inoculums, inadequate storage of samples and multiple rounds of freeze-thaw which decline their HA titers. As the presence of trypsin in the culture medium during multiple cycles of virus replication was demonstrated to enhance the infectivity of rotavirus between 10-and 1000-fold [12] , we could demonstrate that a concentration of 0.5-1 \u03bcg/ml in the serum-free DMEM medium was optimal for virus penetration. However, a concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml resulted in the lysis of cell controls. Whether trypsin concentration (15 or 20 \u03bcg/inoculum) on viral activation or penetration (0.5-1 \u03bcg/ml) affect the viral titer or not was not checked.",
