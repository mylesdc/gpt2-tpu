Increased levels of transaminases and pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the plasma of WT and nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice indicating that NLRP3 is dispensable to control the parasitemia but it is required for a better clearance of parasites in the liver.

Strikingly, caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice showed the most dramatic reduction in the number of IFN-\u03b3-and IL-17-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells associated with higher parasitemia and lower survival. Additionally, caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated significantly reduced liver inflammation with the lowest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels but the highest hepatic parasitic load.

            "text": "Keywords: Trypanosoma cruzi, chagas disease, nlrP3, caspase-1/11, inflammasome, macrophages, liver inTrODUcTiOn Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that affects millions of people in Latin America. As a result of global warming and human migration, this disease is now a global public health issue. This has led to an increased risk of transmission of the infection, mainly through blood transfusion and organ transplantation (1) . Chagas disease is characterized by two distinct phases, an acute phase involving a number of parasites detected in the bloodstream as well as in host tissues, and after parasitemia is controlled, a chronic phase established and represented by subpatent parasitism and positive serology. Approximately 70% of the patients in this phase present with an indeterminate form, while 30% will develop clinically different cardiac, digestive, or cardiodigestive forms of the disease decades after the infection (2) . Based on epidemiological findings as well as on animal models, it has been proposed that this heterogeneous clinical response is linked to host genetic background and the extremely high genetic diversity of T. cruzi (3, 4) . Parasite strains exhibit different organ tropism during acute and chronic infection (5) . In this study, we used T. cruzi-Tulahuen strain that mainly infects liver and spleen and induces liver pathology and splenomegaly during acute phase (6) . Besides, this parasite strain also infects heart contributing to the development of chagasic cardiomyopathy during the chronic phase. Our research group previously demonstrated that during the acute infection with the Tulahuen strain, the liver of C57BL/6 mice displayed numerous cellular infiltrates with predominance of macrophages, granulocytes, and T lymphocytes associated with high expression of TLR9 on these cells and persistent levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results were correlated with higher transaminase activity (7) . Even though macrophages, both classically and alternatively activated, represent immune effectors, and they are also potential reservoirs for T. cruzi (8, 9) .",

            "text": "The simultaneous occurrence of different T helper (Th) cells subsets and the outcome of T. cruzi infection could be defined as a battle between beneficial Th1 response that fights against intracellular parasites and Th2 response that promotes parasite's replication (7, 10) . An important protective role of Th17 cells in the control of parasitemia and survival of T. cruzi-infected mice was recently reported (11) . Protective immune responses against this parasite are based on the release of IL-12 by infected macrophages, which induce IFN-\u03b3 production from natural killer and T cells (12) . IFN-\u03b3 activates nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase expression and the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages, which are critical for their trypanocidal activity (13, 14) . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also plays a role in amplifying microbicidal mechanisms of IFN-\u03b3-activated macrophages and thus contributes to host protection (15) . IFN-\u03b3 is also important for orchestrating the ongoing adaptive immunity, contributing to differentiation of CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cells, required for the control of the parasite multiplication occurring during the acute infection. Among the various CD8+ T cell subsets, Tc1 were shown to play a major role in the fight against T. cruzi (16) . The hallmark of this subset is the production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF. In addition to killing and releasing cytokines, recent studies have ascribed a novel regulatory role to CD8+ T cells (17, 18) . Regulatory CD8+ T cells represent a transient state of effector CD8+ T cells which promote the production of the immunosuppressive IL-10 cytokine to counteract inflammation (19) . The innate immune system utilizes different sets of germlineencoded receptors to detect T. cruzi infection. These include the toll-like receptor (TLR) family members that are expressed at the plasma membrane and in endosomal compartments (20) . Additionally, the intracellular Nod-like receptor (NLR) family comprises several members capable of assembling inflammasomes once they get activated. The different types of inflammasomes are distinguished by their NLRs, adaptors, and stimuli specificities. The NLR pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is possibly the most extensively studied platform, is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damageassociated molecular patterns. The central adaptor molecule, which is required for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, is the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). This pyrin-containing protein recruits pro-caspase-1 and allows its interaction with NLRP3 (21) . The inflammasomes promote the activation of caspase-1 whose pro-inflammatory activity consists in catalyzing the maturation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into its bioactive forms (22) . IL-1\u03b2 induces an increase in the number of activated CD4 and CD8 cells and augments the differentiation of the antigen-triggered T cells (23) . IL-1\u03b2 was also shown to promote IL-17 production highlighting the tight link between them (24) . In concordance with this, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produce IFN-\u03b3 that further activate phagocytic cells to promote parasite killing (25) . Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 is relevant for appropriate antigen presentation in host defense (26, 27) .",

            "text": "infected caspase-1/11-Deficient Mice exhibit an increased number of Macrophages associated With a reduction of hepatic cD8+ T cells In order to elucidate how NLRP3 and caspase-1/11 impact on innate and adaptive immune responses, we infected WT, nlrp3\u2212/\u2212, and caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice and analyzed the hepatic leukocyte infiltration at 14 and 21 dpi. A reduced number of inflammatory foci and total infiltrating cells were found in both deficient strains compared with WT mice at 21 dpi (Figures 2A,B) . When we analyzed the absolute number of hepatic T cell populations (Figures 2C,D) , we found a significant decrease of CD8+ T cells in caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 compared with those of WT mice at 21 dpi. Furthermore, we observed a higher increase in the number of F4/80+ cells in both deficient compared with those of WT mice (Figure 2E) . Taking into account that TLR9 was strongly upregulated in the liver of infected WT mice and that this is linked to an exacerbated inflammatory response with hepatic damage (31), we first evaluated the intracellular expression of TLR9 and NLRP3 in hepatic macrophages of WT mice. We found a co-expression of both innate receptors in isolated macrophages of WT mice by confocal microscopy ( Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). Additionally, we observed a higher number of TLR9+F4/80+ cells in infected nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 compared with that of WT and caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice as measured by flow cytometry ( Figure S2B in Supplementary Material). Considering that macrophages may exert their microbicidal activity through production and release of oxidative stress mediators, we next examined the ability of the liver isolated macrophages of each mouse strain to produce ROS and NO intracellularly. As shown in Figure 3 , we observed that the infection increased the recruitment of ROS- (Figures 3A,B) and NO-producing macrophages from all analyzed groups (Figures 3C,D) . Figure S1 in Supplementary Material. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM from one of three representative experiments; n = 3-6 mice per group. Statistical significance was evaluated by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Figure S1 in Supplementary Material. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM from one of three representative experiments; n = 3-6 mice per group. Statistical significance was evaluated by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Consequently, we analyzed different subsets of liver CD4+ T lymphocytes elicited during T. cruzi infection and measured the characteristic intracellular cytokines for each subtype: IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ (Figure 4A) , IL-4+CD4+ (Figure 4B) , IL-17+CD4+ (Figure 4C) , and IL-10+CD4+ ( Figure 4D) . Interestingly, we found a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 phenotype in nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 similar to infected WT mice, whereas caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 animals displayed a predominant Th2 phenotype at 21 dpi. Furthermore, WT and nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 groups were also able to recruit IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ ( Figure 4E ) and IL-10+CD8+ cells (Figure 4F) , whereas caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 animals exhibited scarce numbers of these CD8 T cell subsets. The only subset of CD8 T cell affected in both NLRP3 and caspase-1/11-deficient mice was IL-17+CD8+ ( Figure 4G) . Altogether, our results clearly demonstrate that the deficiency in caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 worsens the induction of the cytotoxic response during the infection with this parasite. Taking into account that inflammasomes are key signaling platforms to detect intracellular pathogens and release bioactive IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which exert their biological effects through their specific receptors, we analyzed the expression of IL-1R and IL-18R on hepatic T lymphocytes. Thus, we found that nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 animals had a higher number of IL-1R+CD4+ ( Figure 4H ) and IL-18R+CD4+ (Figure 4I ) lymphocytes, whereas When we analyzed pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 in the plasma of both deficient mice, we noted that only nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice produced an increase in this cytokine in a manner similar to WT mice at 14 dpi ( Figure 5C) . Additionally, high TNF concentrations were also detected in both WT and nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice at 14 and 21 dpi, whereas in the caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 group this cytokine was only increased at 21 dpi ( Figure 5D) .",

Indeed, host immune response against T. cruzi is an intricate phenomenon that may play different roles in dissimilar models depending on different parasite strains, the infected tissues and on the point in time at which the infection occurs among other factors. Strikingly, hepatic macrophages from nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increased expression of TLR9 suggesting that this innate receptor is associated with NLRP3 signaling ( Figure S2B in Supplementary Material). Supporting this idea, a recent report described how TLR9 negatively regulates the NLRP3-IL-1\u03b2 pathway in an infection model (39) . Moreover, the absence of NLRP3 could be inducing a positive feedback on TLR9 expression as has been proposed (40) (41) (42) . Interestingly, the higher number of hepatic ROS+ and NO+ macrophages from infected nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 and caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice, prompted us to suggest that these anti-parasitic mechanisms would be relevant for an early control of infection (43) . The trypanocidal activity attributed to NO is actually mediated by peroxynitrites (44) and IFN-\u03b3 and TNF pro-inflammatory cytokines may enhance the innate effector mechanisms against the pathogen (45) (46) (47) (48) . Furthermore, it was recently reported that, independently of caspase-1/11, TNF and ROS may activate macrophages to kill pathogens by recruiting lysosomes and acidifying pathogen-containing vacuoles (46) . Interestingly, IL-17A cytokine also acts on macrophages enhancing the killing of intracellular parasites (12) . Interestingly, a caspase-1 dependent and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 independent pathway for NO production was described as an important effector mechanism played by NLRP3 to control T. cruzi-Y strain infection in vitro (28) . Further investigation of this group demonstrated that lysosomal cathepsin B was required for NLRP3 activation, since its inhibition abrogates IL-1\u03b2 release by macrophages (28) . The molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation that promote killing parasite inside macrophages infected by T. cruzi-Tulahuen strain in vitro remain unexplored and they are an interesting aspect of future studies. On the other hand, IL-17A cytokine may also act on macrophages enhancing the killing of intracellular parasites (12) . Interestingly, this cytokine was detected by us in hepatic CD4+ T cells from infected WT and NLRP3-deficient mice. The interplay between innate and adaptive immunity is very important in the progression and outcome of T. cruzi infection.",

This proinflammatory cytokine promotes the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes, regulates the infiltration of inflammatory cells, induces chemotaxis and activation of other inflammatory factors, regulates the function of epithelial cells, and might produce tissue damage by mediating inflammation (49) . In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells (Th1) was predominant over IL-17+CD4+ T cells (Th17) in infected nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice. Conversely, the defect in caspase-1/11 signaling led to the lack of IL-1\u03b2 induction and to a profound reduction of IFN-\u03b3-and IL-17-producing T cells, which is in line with other reports (50, 51) . Consequently, we observed a predominant Th2 phenotype on hepatic CD4+ lymphocytes from infected caspase-1/11 KO mice. Additionally, high levels of IL-18 were found in the plasma of infected NLRP3-deficient mice supporting the idea that IL-18 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 in Th1 (40) . The bioactivity of this cytokine depends on its concentration, the level of its natural inhibitor, IL-18 binding protein, and the surface expression of IL-18R on the responding cells (52) . In agreement with the above-described results, the high number of hepatic IL-18R+ and IL-1R+CD4+ T cells was detected in infected nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice suggesting that different inflammasomes other than NLRP3 may be activated upon infection. As expected, the number of hepatic IL-18R-and IL-1R-expressing CD4+ T cells in caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice did not suffer any change.",

Moreover, cytotoxic T cells are essential for the control of infection in adaptive immunity since mice lacking CD8+ T cell compartment succumb to acute phase and display high systemic and tissue parasite loads (25) . Besides, pre-clinical models of Chagas disease have demonstrated that antigen-specific IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells are essential for reducing parasite burden, increasing survival, and decreasing pathology in both the acute and chronic phases of disease (54) . In this study, we also observed the presence of IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells (Tc-17 subset) (55, 56) only in infected WT mice, suggesting the relevance of NLRP3 in the induction of this T cell sub-population. Interestingly, systemic IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF cytokines were associated with increased ALT and AST transaminases and LDH activities in infected WT and nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice. The increase of AST may reflect the damage exerted by the parasite and inflammatory response in the different tissues as liver, spleen, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidneys, whereas ALT represent an hepatic injury biomarker. It is noteworthy that caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 group exhibited a light increase of ALT though a strong increase in AST and LDH at 21 dpi probably due to the reduced infiltrated inflammatory foci in liver but increased and disseminated parasitemia. In line with our results, deficiency in caspase-1 resulted in high levels of parasitemia and increased number of amastigotes within macrophages isolated from caspase-1 KO mice and infected with T. cruzi-Y strain (28) .",
