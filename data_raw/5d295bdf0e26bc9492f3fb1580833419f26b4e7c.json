            "text": "Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.",

Their genome is made up of several segments, each packed in independent particles. However, since the completion of the viral cycle requires the full genome, these particles need to coinfect each host. This imposes strong constraints on the minimum number of independently transmitted particles, making the rise and persistence of multipartitism an evolutionary puzzle. By using analytical and numerical tools, we study the ecological interaction between monopartite and multipartite forms, in terms of their ability to spread on, and take over, a host population. We reveal that this interaction can take various forms (competition, cooperation, commensality), depending on the underlying structure of contacts among hosts. We also find that, in some situations, multipartitism represents an effective adaptive strategy, allowing the virus to colonize environments in which the monopartite form cannot thrive. Finally, we uncover that contact structures typical of farmed plants favor multipartitism, suggesting a correlation between the intensification of agricultural practices and an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral species.",

In most viral species, each viral particle contains all the genetic material needed to carry out replication inside a host cell, and generate a progeny of viral particles. A prominent exception to this behavior is found in multipartite viruses. These viruses, first described in the 1960s [1] , have a genome segmented in two or more parts. According to current evidence, the segments are encapsidated separately and, apparently, propagate independently [2, 3] . As of today, there is no mainstream theory able to explain the adaptive advantage of such a strange lifestyle [4] . The main puzzle regarding multipartite viruses is how the simultaneous presence of multiple segments, which imposes severe constraints on the number of viral particles that have to reach a susceptible host, is balanced by other adaptive advantages of multipartitism, whether microscopic or ecological [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Despite this apparent paradox, multipartitism is widespread in the Virosphere, as up to 40% of all known viral families are multipartite [7] . A large majority of them infects either plants or fungi, with only four known examples of species infecting exclusively animals [5] . Evolutionary pathways leading to multipartitism are likely to be multiple, since this strategy is present in RNA and DNA viruses, and in the latter case an origin to a single ancestral virus cannot be traced. Beyond its virological interest, multipartitism has a particularly negative effect on agricultural production, as several multipartite viruses are pathogenic, and routinely cripple crop yield [8] . Cultivars themselves may have directly played a role in the rise of multipartitism, as an evolutionary radiation in the diversity of viral species, many being just centuries old, was likely promoted by an intensification of agricultural practices [9] [10] [11] . It has been put forward that multipartite species might be at an advantage in the face of environmental changes, since they likely adapt faster due to new combinations of segments promoted by their genomic architecture [5] . It is known that changes in land cover offer multiple opportunities for novel interactions between plants and pathogens [12] [13] [14] [15] . Studies on the impact of agriculture in viral ecology have uncovered a surprisingly negative association between plant diversity and family-level diversity of plant-associated viruses, and a higher prevalence of viruses in cultivated areas [16] .",

Specifically, it has been shown in vitro that two defective forms spontaneously generated by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV has an unsegmented genome formed by ssRNA of positive polarity) can complement each other and quickly substitute the wt form [20] . This strategy has been formally explored in models of competitive dynamics between the wt and a number of complementing segments [21] , which implemented different advantages that could compensate for the cost of an increased MOI. The model mimicked the experimental setting where, in particular, host-cell availability corresponded to that of a well-mixed system. Two of the advantages implemented had been theoretically proposed in the past, though, as of yet, have not received empirical support (a faster replicative ability [22] and a slower accumulation of deleterious mutations in shorter segments [23, 24] ) while, in the case of FMDV, it was shown that capsids containing shorter genomes enjoyed a larger average lifetime between infection events [25] . This differential degradation, dependent on genome length, was sufficient to compensate for co-infection requirements in multipartite forms with two, to up to four, segments [21] , but cannot explain the emergence of multipartite viruses with many segments, such as nanoviruses or babuviruses [5] . Hence, the evolutionary pathway explored in that work would be applicable to a subset of all currently described multipartite viral species.",

This allows us to study the competition dynamics between the different forms causing them to coexist in, or take over the ecological niche. Using both analytical calculations and numerical tools, we investigate the outcome of a random emergence of mutants, and derive the conditions that make multipartitism a fitness-enhancing strategy, allowing the virus to adapt to a wider range of hosts and environments. Since no apparent structural feature discriminates multipartite viruses from monopartite ones-they are found exhibiting different capsid structures, genome sizes and types [26] -we include in the model as few virological features as possible, and investigate how multipartitism impacts on the spreading potential of the virus. We do, however, account for key viral mechanisms that can drive the resilience of multipartitism in an ecological context. The first one is the already mentioned differential degradation, i.e., the different average lifetime of defective viral particles with respect to wt's, or formally equivalent advantages of faster replication or elimination of deleterious mutations through sex. A second biological mechanism is the mode of transmission of multipartite viruses between hosts. Most known multipartite viruses are spread by vectors (mainly insects), which typically pick up very few viral particles from an infected plant [27] . The transmission process between hosts typically acts as a population bottleneck for the virus, entailing a loss of genetic diversity and, if severe enough, the systematic purge of deleterious forms [28, 29] . Thanks to our parsimonious modeling setup, any of the aforementioned mechanisms can be seen as effectively impacting the chances of the wt or defective particles to reach the target hosts, leading to a difference in transmissibility. A single model parameter, therefore, by tuning this relative transmissibility, embraces a number of different biological processes. In this sense, the results of our model can be extended to other systems as long as the specific mechanisms involved in their spreading fitness can be cast in the form of changes in transmissibility. Remarkably, we find out that even in the absence of an explicit microscopic advantage, ecological dynamics might cause the fixation of the multipartite form due to the stochastic extinction (analogous to random drift) of the monopartite virus.",

For a graphic representation of the spreading routes and differential transmissibility see Fig  1D. In the general case, an agent in a given compartment may transmit some (or all) of the viral species it hosts to the one it is in contact with, with a probability depending on the initial compartments of the two agents, and on the final compartment. For instance, a host in compartment \u231c1\u231f, upon contact with a susceptible one, may transmit both wt and 1, turning the susceptible into a \u231c1\u231f. It may instead transmit wt alone, turning the susceptible into a \u231cwt\u231f. The defective variant, however, cannot be transmitted alone, as it requires wt, as previously In each line, the viral particles infecting the same host cell are shown on the left, and the product of replication on the right. B) describes the different infectious compartments of the model at population level, in terms of the viral species they are infected by. In C) we outline the compartmental model of a bipartite virus. An arrow going from one compartment to another means that a host in the former state can move to the latter by coming into contact with one of the compartments marked as dots on the arrow itself. Here, we show neither the recovery rate (\u03bc) at which infectious compartments turn susceptible, nor the transmission rates corresponding to each interaction. D) illustrates the vector-mediated viral transmission from host to host. The vector picks up some viral particles of different variants (represented in the figure below the vector itself). During the time it takes for it to reach another plant, these particles degrade. One hypothesis behind differential transmissibility is differential degradation, here depicted. Lower degradation rates due of the defective variants lead to a chance of transmission higher than wt. Fig 1C. Our assumption of constant host population (of size N) holds for strictly constant size, as well as populations that are at equilibrium, i.e., the number of births equals the number of deaths, or at least any growth pattern occurs at time scales much larger than the spread of the virus. This assumption is connected to the spreading model, as the recovery process of the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible model can be regarded in two ways. It can be seen as proper recovery, with the host clearing the virus but acquiring no immunity to reinfection. It can also be interpreted as the virus killing the host, and a new (susceptible) host filling its ecological space.",

There are four possible endemic states, depending of which variants circulate. We equivalently use the term equilibria, as they are the stable equilibrium points of the spreading dynamics. The first one is wt, in which only the wt is prevalent, and the defective variants have died out. This case maps into an effective SIS model for the compartment \u231cwt\u231f. In the second one, hj, any defective segment can circulate alongside the wt because, roughly speaking, the transmissibility of the latter is so high that any defective variant can hijack it, with no need to complement the genome with other variants. In this case, we will likely see the circulation of a number of variants lower than v, as segments can go extinct without hampering the circulation of the remaining ones. The third endemic state, seg, witnesses the presence of all the v segmented variants without wt, and in this case complementation is essential. This state is an SIS model for the compartment \u231cseg\u231f. Finally, the state all exhibits circulation of the wt plus all the variants v. Borrowing some terminology from physics, we can then define different epidemic phases. Phases are regions of the space of model parameters. Inside each phase, the macroscopic behavior of viral spread is qualitatively the same. Specifically, we can define a phase in terms of which endemic states it allows. The parameter surfaces separating different phases are called phase transitions, the most important in epidemiology being the epidemic threshold. Below the epidemic threshold, only the dfs exists. Above it, the pathogen can circulate. There, we identify five other phases: wt-phase allows only wt; contingent-phase allows wt, hj and all; mix-phase allows wt, seg and all; seg-phase allows only seg; finally all-phase admits all the possible endemic states.

We denote hk m i as the m-th moment of the degree distribution, computed as hk m i = \u2211 k p \u03b3 (k)k m , as usual. The term hki appearing in Eq 1 is then the expected degree. The Greek indices \u03b2, \u03bd, \u03c3, run on all the infectious compartments defined before. The susceptible compartment is not included, as the number of susceptible hosts is completely determined by the other compartments, thanks to the assumption of constant population size. \u0393 \u03bd\u03b2 is the rate of the transition \u231c\u03b2\u231f\u231cS\u231f ! \u03b2\u231c\u03bd\u231f, i.e., a transition affecting the prevalence of compartment \u231c\u03bd\u231f through a contact between a host in compartment \u231c\u03b2\u231f and a Susceptible. \u039b \u03bd\u03b2\u03c3 encodes transmission rates among infected individuals, and specifically a transmission from \u231c\u03b2\u231f to\u231c\u03c3\u231f, that leads to the change of the prevalence of \u231c\u03bd\u231f.

Eq (1) thus links the change in the number of hosts with a given degree, and in a compartment ( _ x k n ), to one reaction and two diffusion processes. The first term, mx k n , represents the decrease due to hosts recovering back to the susceptible state. The second one, with coupling constant \u0393, contains the probability of a host, with degree k, being susceptible (1 \u00c0 P s x k s ), and being infected by a host in compartment \u03b2, and degree h.

Given that homogeneous contact networks have hki \ufffd hk 2 i, the heterogeneous (power-law-like) network recovers the homogeneous case when \u03b3 ! 1. Hence, the smaller the exponent \u03b3, the more heterogeneous the contact network is, i.e., hosts with a large number of connections become more likely. These hosts can reach a significant part of the population, and when infectious, they act as superspreades. They are responsible for causingm to go to zero (m ! 0) in the limit of large population size (N ! 1), when the exponent of the degree distribution respects 2 < \u03b3 < 3. This implies not only that T 1 goes to zero, as it is well-known [41] , but that T 2 and T s do it as well.

The points are numerically recovered endemic states, their type being indicated by the labels. In A) the underlying contact network is homogeneous, so thatm \u00bc m \u00bc 0:25. The solid vertical lines mark the analytical prediction of the total prevalence when wt is present either alone or together with just one variant. The dashed vertical lines mark the analytical prediction of the prevalence when the segments circulate without wt. The crosses mark the prevalence values of the equilibrium points averaged over the runs not leading to extinction, among the 5000 executed per point. B) focuses on P 3 (in Fig 2E) : the fixed valuem \u00bc 0:25 is obtained either as m \u00bcm (homogeneous network, as in (B)), or with two heterogeneous networks with exponent \u03b3 = 3.5, \u03bc = 0.45 and \u03b3 = 3.2, \u03bc \ufffd 0.81 (and thus hki/hk 2 i \ufffd 0.56 and hki/hk 2 i \ufffd 0.31, respectively). For each of the points and the equilibria examined, C) reports the branching ratio, defined as the probability of reaching that particular equilibrium. They are computed by starting all the simulations with all susceptible but one in \u231call\u231f (infected by wt and all the variants), and counting the fraction of the runs that reach that equilibrium, among the ones that do not go to extinction.",

These segments cannot persist on their own, but the highly prevalent wt allows them to complete the replication cycle. At this stage, any defective segment is a commensal of wt, as the persistence of the former depends on the latter, while wt's fitness remains unchanged. The emergence of multipartitism in this context is a contingent process: segments circulate simply because they are allowed to, causing no change to the overall fitness of the virus. Furthermore, there is no selective pressure towards complementation, as a combination of segments reconstructing the full genome without the presence of the wt (compartment \u231cseg\u231f) would not be able to persist. This is confirmed by the functional form of T 2 in Eq (4), which features no dependence on the number of complementing variants v: the survival of each mutant is independent of the presence of others, as effective replication and diffusion is wt-mediated. In other words, complementation would not make the variants fitter to the environment.",

Here, in addition to the commensal relationship between wt and segments, complementing variants are able to circulate on their own, without wt: the equilibrium seg emerges. Selection then imposes a bias on those segments that together reconstruct the genome, as they represent a new effective spreading configuration, and increase the overall viral fitness. They are thus advantaged with respect to purely commensal segments. This fitness-enhancing effect is quite straightforward: let us suppose that, due to viral or host population bottlenecks, or another stochastic event, wt prevalence goes down drastically, to the point where it is cleared from the system. In the contingent-phase this would lead to complete viral extinction, as all the segments would die out, too, as their persistence is linked to wt's. In the all-phase, on the other hand, the virus is more resilient, as it can still circulate thanks to complementation. This time selective pressure toward complementation is well visible in the expression of T s in Eq (4), which depends exponentially on the number of variants v. This fact is in qualitative agreement with results in [21] , where it was shown that the larger the number of segments, the harder to reach the persistence of the segmented variants within a host. Even if the multipartite genome does not enjoy any microscopic advantage, it can rise to fixation if the monopartite virus undergoes stochastic extinction. Though fluctuations would also affect the multipartite form, and stochastic extinction of the monopartite form is not very likely, similar scenarios are relevant in virus evolution [45, 46] and cannot be discarded a priori.",

The total prevalence of the latter state is higher than wt's and hj's in the same phase, implying that some hosts are infected by complementing segments without wt (compartment \u231cseg\u231f), that is by a bona fide multipartite virus. Given that the multipartite form is not endemic in this phase-the contingent-phase relies on the wt for viral persistence -, this excess prevalence of the all state is a by-product of overall viral prevalence, rather than its driver: an extinction of the wt would quickly drive segmented variants to extinction. It is, however, an important one, as while it may not increase fitness in that specific environment, it permits the independent replication of the set of complementing variants; these are then able to invade other environments in which the wt could not persist, as we will see in the following.",

A low epidemic threshold is a well known feature of heterogeneous networks [41, 42, 44] . Specifically, power-law networks with \u03b3 < 3 exhibit a vanishing threshold as they grow larger, as the emergence of highly connected hubs ensures the persistence of the disease at any value of transmissibility, that is hki/hk 2 i ! 0 (and as a result,m ! 0) as the number of potential hosts grows, N ! 1. In our case this translates into T 1 , which is the epidemic threshold, going to zero form ! 0. Also T 2 , T s ! 0. Further information is obtained when comparing their limit behaviors. Asm becomes smaller, T 2 /T 1 increases but remains finite, while T s /T 1 ! 1. This implies that, the higher the heterogeneity of the network is, the more difficult it becomes for multipartitism to persist. Specifically, reaching the all-phase from the wt-phase would require an infinite relative increase (in the limitm ! 0) in transmissibility. Even when heterogeneity is not severe enough so as to cause the threshold to vanish, i.e., when \u03b3 > 3, heterogeneity makes it harder to sustain multipartitism, as both T 2 /T 1 and T s /T 1 are decreasing functions ofm.",

Qualitatively, this is the result of the complex interaction between the bottlenecks induced by between-host transmission and the presence of superspreaders, i.e., hosts that can potentially infect a large fraction of the population thanks to their high number of contacts. Combining this mechanism with a low MOIand hence low \u03bb-predicts an evolutionary radiation of multipartite viral forms linked to the rise and intensification of agricultural practices. In crops and cultivars, contacts among hosts are much more homogeneous (and often closer) than in wild settings, tremendously alleviating the requirements imposed by co-infection. Multipartite viruses adapted to the patchy distribution of wild hosts could have found it easy to propagate in regular, monospecific host populations which in all cases have closely related wild forms from which they departed through artificial selection [47] .",

As \u03c1 increases, the endemic state seg becomes more prevalent and more likely with respect to wt (see Fig 3C and 3D) . Specifically, the value of the transmissibility for which z seg > z wt decreases as \u03c1 increases, facilitating the predominance of the multipartite form (in Fig 3A point P 3 has z wt < z seg , while P 4 and P 5 have z seg > z wt ). Most importantly, \u03c1 > 1 causes two new phases to emerge (Fig 3B, 3C and 3D) , and both facilitate the rise of multipartitism by eliminating hj from their possible equilibria. One is the mixphase, in which the virus circulates either as wt or as a multipartite.

The second emerging phase is the seg-phase, in which only the complemented multipartite virus is able to circulate, while the monopartite version quickly goes extinct (yellow, and point P 6 in Figs 2 and 3) . This phase is of paramount importance because it lies in a parameter region where, without developing multipartitism, the virus would not be endemic. In addition, by prescribing the exclusive presence of the multipartite form, it allows to explain the phenomenology observed in nature, as the simultaneous presence of monopartite and defective-complementing forms of the same virus has been observed only in vitro [20, [48] [49] [50] . In vivo, viral species circulate as either pure monopartite (endemic state wt), or pure multipartite (seg). Furthermore, although in vitro several defective viral forms are generated and detected, and propagate along the wt (which would correspond to an in vitro hj), this equilibrium is rarely found in wild plants. There is, however, an association between fully-fledged viruses and defective viral forms formally equivalent to the hj equilibrium: virus and viral satellites [51] . Often, in addition, satellites modify the aetiology of viral infections [52] , such that the transmissibility and the recovery rate might be affected by its presence in no particular direction, a phenomenon we do not consider in our model. There are other classes of hyperparasites that depend on a functional virus for replication (e.g. virophages [53] or viroid-like satellites [54] ) whose ecological dynamics could, with appropriate modifications, be described in the framework discussed here. Interestingly, it has been proposed that virus-satellite associations, a typically unrelated tandem from a phylogenetic viewpoint, might evolve towards full co-dependence, and therefore be a possible, alternative evolutionary pathway to multipartitism [5] .",

A second population, occupying an adjacent geographic area, may have a different parameter (m B >m A ), due to a different contact topology. As the inset of Fig 2C shows , the virus is able to colonize the second population only through an evolutionary process that increases its transmissibility up to at least \u03bb B 0 , so that point B 0 is above the epidemic threshold (green path in the figure). It is reasonable to assume that the larger the increase in transmissibility required, the less likely this process is, given that the required mutation(s) are less likely and possibly more costly to maintain. The emergence of multipartitism decreases the evolutionary distance between the two states, increasing adaptability (magenta path in the figure). Random mutations, in fact, need to increase transmissibility from \u03bb A (wt-phase) to \u03bb B < \u03bb B 0 (all-phase), where a complementing, multipartite version of the virus can emerge. Invasion of the second population is now possible, because the new viral forms effectively lowers the epidemic threshold inm B , thanks to the emergence of the seg-phase (point B). This simplistic example not only shows that multipartitism can emerge as a fitness-enhancing feature, but also that coexistence of monopartite and multipartite forms is a key stage in the evolutionary process, albeit possibly transient and short-lived. In addition to outlining the adaptive potential of multipartitism, this example elucidates the hampering effect of network heterogeneity. By increasing the distance between the wt-phase and the all-phase, network heterogeneity reduces the ratio \u03bb B 0 /\u03bb B , making multipartitism less advantageous. In conclusion, while making viral persistence overall easier, network heterogeneity curbs the potential of multipartitism as an effective adaptation strategy.",

We have developed a framework that, starting from few key biological features, models the interaction between monopartite and multipartite forms, driven by the spreading dynamics on a host population. Despite assuming that multipartitism emerged from complementation between defective viral forms generated by the wt virus, as it has been observed in vitro, our results can be extended to other situations with relative ease. Most importantly, in addition, we have described how the structure of contacts among hosts drives the rise and persistence of the different viral forms. We have analytically characterized the parameter regions leading to viral persistence, in the form of wt only, of wt and defective segments, or segments only. We have also defined the different types of relationships between wt and segments, and specifically the presence or absence of selective pressure towards complementation, i.e., to witnessing the circulation of defective variants that may cooperatively reconstruct the whole genome. We have corroborated these findings through stochastic numerical simulations aimed at computing the prevalence of the different endemic states, and their probability of occurrence. As a result, we have been able to identify under which ecological conditions would multipartitism be a successful adaptive strategy, in the presence or absence of microscopic advantages, to new external conditions and environments characterized by variations in the topology of contacts between hosts. Defective particles generated through replication errors would start circulating by hijacking the wt. Subsequently, a complementing set of variants might form. Once that situation is achieved, even a small advantage in transmissibility (\u03c1 > 1) would give an advantage to the multipartite form, which could anyway replace the monopartite form if chance causes the stochastic extinction of the latter. This sequence of events represents a plausible, parsimonious evolutionary pathway to the rise and persistence of multipartite viruses, and clarifies in which manner multipartitism might be an effective adaptive strategy at the ecological level.",

Firstly, we note that for v > 1 the total prevalence, now defined as z = \u2211 \u03bd x \u03bd , no longer behaves like an SIS, due to the presence of the compartment \u231cseg\u231f. Indeed, one can show that, when summing over \u03bd in Eq (1), the terms with \u039b cancel out, as they pertain to interaction exclusively among infectious compartments, which by definition cannot change the total prevalence, and so all the contributions must cancel out. This is not the case however for the terms with \u0393, so that the final equation is _ z \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 z\u00de P b \u00f0Gx\u00de b \u00c0 mz, which does not decouple from x \u03bd . Interestingly, despite this breaking of the SIS symmetry, which was crucial to solve the v = 1 model, we can still prove that the values of T 1 , T 2 found for v = 1 generalize to an arbitrary number of variants. We start from the first critical surface (T 1 ). We compute the Jacobian matrix of Eq (6) in the dfs, i.e., x \u03b2 = 08\u03b2. We get J (dfs) = \u0393 \u2212 \u03bc. We now argue that \u0393, and therefore the Jacobian matrix, is upper triangular, thanks to the specific ordering of the compartments that we introduced. \u0393 \u03bd\u03b2 is the rate at which a susceptible becomes a \u231c\u03bd\u231f, upon contact with a \u231c\u03b2\u231f. For this to happen (\u0393 \u03bd\u03b2 > 0), \u231c\u03b2\u231f must contain at least all the viral species \u231c\u03bd\u231f contains. Hence, either \u03b2 = \u03bd (diagonal term), or \u03b2 > \u03bd. By the same reasoning, the diagonal terms are \u0393 \u03b2\u03b2 = \u03bb \u03c6(\u03b2) , where \u03c6(\u03b2) is the number of viral species in \u231c\u03b2\u231f, e.g. \u03c6(\u231cwt\u231f) = 1, \u03c6(\u231call\u231f) = v+ 1. From these considerations, the spectrum of J (dfs) is {\u03bb \u03c6(\u03b2) \u2212\u03bc;8\u03b2}. Keeping in mind that \u03bb < 1, we recover the first critical point: T 1 = {\u03bb = \u03bc}.",

As customary, we assume \u03b3 > 2, so that the average degree is defined in arbitrary large populations.
