Therefore, new innovative therapies are urgently required in order to combat the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancers. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. For example, in a recent study, immunotherapy using synthetic long peptide vaccine derived from human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and E7 antigens has led to significant clini-cal responses in patients with precancerous lesions of gynecological malignancies [1] .",

Intradermal administration of DNA encoding CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and impressive antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.",

The exact mechanism of action in which imiquimod and its analogs activate the immune system is still under active investigation. Nevertheless, it is known that imiquimod activates immune cells through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), commonly involved in pathogen recognition, on the cell surface [13, 14] . Cells activated by imiquimod via TLR-7 secrete cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [15] . There is evidence that imiquimod, when applied to skin, can lead to the activation of Langerhans cells, which subsequently migrates to local lymph nodes to activate the adaptive immune system [16] . Other cell types activated by imiquimod include NK cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes [16] .",

Mice were then left untreated or treated with imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 treatments. Mice were euthanized at d21 and tumors were harvested and photographed for tumor size comparison. After having proved that imiquimod was effective as a single agent, we proceeded with the second-step experiment. Mice were divided into four groups (5/group: untreated, imiquimod alone, CRT/E7 alone, and combined group). All mice were inoculated with TC-1 cells (5 \u00d7 10 4 /mouse) s.c. over right leg at d0. For the untreated group, mice were regularly followed for tumor growth after TC-1 implantation without specific treatment. For the imiquimod group, each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days (began at d6 for a total of 6 treatments). For CRT/E7 alone group, each mouse was vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 2 \u03bcg via gene gun at d9, d13, and d17. For the combined treatment group, each mouse received the same treatment schedule as for each monotherapy alone group. Tumor sizes in the mice were monitored and measured every 3-4 days using digital calipers.",

Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of CRT/ E7 DNA vaccination with imiquimod treatment may result in an increase in M1 macrophages in the tumor, which can contribute to the antitumor effect (for reviews see [21, 22] ) It has been shown that TC-1 tumors contain significant number of M2 macrophages, that lead to suppression of antitumor T-cell response, thus facilitating tumor growth [23] .

It has been shown that myeloid-derived suppressor cells play an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment (for reviews, see [25] [26] [27] ). The reduction in MDSCs may potentially lead to improved antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses, resulting in better tumor killing.",
