We identified the salicylanilide niclosamide as a broad range antiviral agent targeting acidified endosomes. Niclosamide is approved for human use against helminthic infections, and has anti-neoplastic and antiviral effects. Its mode of action is unknown. Here, we show that niclosamide, which is a weak lipophilic acid inhibited infection with pH-dependent human rhinoviruses (HRV) and influenza virus. Structure-activity studies showed that antiviral efficacy and endolysosomal pH neutralization co-tracked, and acidification of the extracellular medium bypassed the virus entry block. Niclosamide did not affect the vacuolar H + -ATPase, but neutralized coated vesicles or synthetic liposomes, indicating a proton carrier mode-of-action independent of any protein target. This report demonstrates that physico-chemical interference with host pathways has broad range antiviral effects, and provides a proof of concept for the development of host-directed antivirals.",

Yet, broad range inhibitors against viral pathogens are presently not available. Classical antiviral strategies have targeted viral structural or enzymatic motifs with high specificity and potentially low side effects. These agents are, however, prone to viral evasion, and select for resistant strains [2] . To identify novel chemical inhibitors of virus infection we performed a high-content, image-based infection screen using a library of approximately 1200 known bioactive and food and drug administration (FDA) approved small compounds for their ability to inhibit human rhinovirus (HRV) 16 infection of HeLa cells.",

Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a capsid of 28-30 nm in diameter and a plus-sense, 6500-9000 nucleotide RNA genome. The genome encodes a single poly-protein, which is proteolytically processed during infection [3] . HRVs comprise more than one hundred known serotypes. They are the most frequent viral infections among humans and the predominant cause of the common cold [4] . HRV infections can pose severe health risks in patients with pre-existing airway conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or cystic fibrosis. This may relate to the observation that HRVs are not limited to the upper respiratory tract but also infect the lower respiratory tracts [4] . Two receptor groups have been defined for the species A and B viruses. The minor group viruses comprise twelve members utilizing low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) proteins for cell entry, and the major group uses the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) [5] . These infections are typically pH-dependent and require the passage of viruses through acidic endosomal compartments. The recently discovered species C HRVs, which are prevalent in young children appear to use distinct but unknown attachment sites for infection [6] .",

Niclosamide is an FDA approved anti-helmintic compound used in humans since more than forty years [10] . It has been applied as an agrochemical and in human therapy. It is well tolerated by rats with an acute oral toxicity LD 50 dose larger than 5 g/kg body weight and only a marginal decrease in haemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte count occurred when male and female rats were given niclosamide at 5 g/kg/day for four weeks [11] . Niclosamide was originally developed at Farbenfabriken Bayer based on the observation that bithionol (2,29-sulfanediyl-bis(4,6-dichlorophenol)) had potent antihelmintic activity. Later work on hydroxyl-biphenyls led to the discovery of niclofolan (5,59dichloro-2,29-dihydroxy-3,39-dinitrobiphenyl), which was modified to niclosamide. Niclosamide was introduced into the market in 1960 under the trade name Bayluscide (Bayer 73) , and has been used over decades to treat gastrointestinal tapeworm infections, both in humans and animals, [for an overview, see 12] . Niclosamide is receiving renewed attention due to antiviral effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [13] , anti-anthrax toxin properties [14] , and anti-neoplastic activity [15] . In addition, niclosamide is a potent inducer of LC3-positive autophagosomes [16] , an inhibitor of the Wnt/Frizzled pathway [17] , a suppressor of the autonomous notch-signalling pathway [18] , and an inhibitor of mTOR signalling [19] . In addition, it uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [20] , thus slowing down cell growth.",

We tested the efficacy of niclosamide to block picornavirus infections using a panel of different enteroviruses, comprising four HRVs and coxsackieviruses (CV). We found that pH-dependent HRVs using the LDLR family (HRV1A, 2), the ICAM1 tropic major group (HRV14, 16) and the genetic groups A (HRV1A, 2 16) and B (HRV14) were sensitive to niclosamide at IC 50 (the concentration with 50% of the maximal inhibition) of 0.84 to 1.4 mM ( Figure 1A , B and Figure S1A in Text S1). The largely pH-independent coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR)tropic CVB3 and CVB4 [21] , and the ICAM1-tropic CVA21 were broadly unaffected at 1 mM and had IC 50 values of .50 mM, 3.88 mM and 6.63 mM, respectively. This is also reflected in the therapeutic index (TI), reflecting the ratio of IC 50 to CC 50 , the latter being the concentration with half maximal toxicity. We measured cellular energy levels using a resazurin fluorometric assay to assess the toxicity of niclosamide. Toxicity was clearly separated from antiviral efficacy against HRV1A, 2, 14, and 16 at least 10-fold (see Figure 1A and Figure S1B in Text S1). The toxicity profile closely matched the antiviral efficacy against herpes simplex virus (HSV1), which had IC 50 values exceeding 10 mM.",

This suggested that the mode of inhibition did not involve high affinity drug targets or irreversible metabolic changes in the cells even when exceeding 10-fold IC 50 and longterm incubation. To better define the inhibition mode of niclosamide, we performed 19uC trapping experiments. At this temperature, uptake of cargo into early endosomes is allowed, but membrane maturation and sorting from these early compartments are strongly slowed down [23] . HRV1A or HRV16 was internalized at 19uC for 1, 2 or 3 h followed by treatment with niclosamide at 37uC, or with drugs affecting capsid conversion. Here, we used the term 'capsid conversion' to measure cellular cues priming the virus for RNA release [5] , for example virusreceptor interactions or low endosomal pH. Capsid conversion was measured by the sensitivity of HRV to pleconaril, which binds to capsid and interferes with immediate early receptor",

Targeting host pathways, on the other hand can have broad antiviral effects, albeit with possible side effects. Here, we report the mode of antiviral action of a small chemical compound, niclosamide. Niclosamide belongs to the salicylanilides, and has been FDA approved to treat parasitic helminthic infestations in humans since decades. In recent years, niclosamide was shown to have anti-neoplastic and antiviral effects. We screened a library of FDA-approved chemicals, and found that niclosamide is an entry inhibitor for a number of pH-dependent respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and human rhinoviruses. Cell biological and biochemical analyses and intracellular pH measurements showed that niclosamide neutralizes acidic membrane-bounded compartments. Niclosamide did not affect the vacuolar ATPase but acted as a protonophore, both in vesicles isolated from cells, and protein-free liposome assays. It blocked rhinovirus infections synergistically with the proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Niclosamide targets endosomes by a mode of action distinct from that of endosomal pH neutralizing agents, such as chloroquine, which accumulates in acidic endosomes.",

The (v)LDLRtropic HRV1A, in contrast, remained at least partly pleconarilsensitive, indicating that it did not get past the 19uC step towards an acidic compartment where the pH-dependent conversion step occurs, as shown earlier for the (v)LDLR-tropic HRV2 [26] . As expected, BafA1 inhibited the infection with both HRV1A and HRV16, but not the pH-independent CVB3, when added after 1, 2 or 3 h at 19uC. Likewise, niclosamide blocked HRV1A and HRV16 but not CVB3 when added after the 19uC block.

We therefore tested if niclosamide neutralized the low endosomal pH, as measured by ratiometric imaging of acridine orange (AO) fluorescence [29] ( Figure 3A ). AO accumulates in vesicular compartments and emits red fluorescence, supposedly due to quenching in acidic compartments. Upon treating cells with the lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl, or the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1 the emitted fluorescence of AO shifted from red to green, indicating de-quenching upon endosomal pH neutralization. Ratiometric live cell measurements showed that niclosamide increased the vesicular pH, similar to NH 4 Cl or BafA1 ( Figure 3G , and Figure S6A and B in Text S1). These results were confirmed by lysotracker DND99 measurements, which showed a steep decline in fluorescence upon treatment with micromolar concentrations of niclosamide, or nanomolar concentrations of BafA1 ( Figure 3B ). This indicated that niclosamide neutralized low pH endosomal compartments. It is well established that endolysosomal acidification is largely driven by v-ATPases by consumption of ATP, [reviewed in 30] . To test if niclosamide affected the v-ATPase activity, we isolated bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV), and measured the hydrolysis of ATP by the production of inorganic phosphate (P i ). While niclosamide had no effects on ATP consumption, the v-ATPase inhibitors BafA1 or concanamycin A (Conc A) completely blocked the production of P i ( Figure S6C in Text S1, for an electron micrograph of isolated CCV, see Figure 3F ). This indicated that niclosamide did not inhibit the v-ATPase activity.",

We found that the addition of pH 5.5 or 6 medium reversed the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on 19uC trapped viruses and promoted infection ( Figure 3C ). The infection stimulation was more pronounced at pH 5.5 than 6, possibly due to activation of virus penetration through the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained with BafA1 treatment of 19uC trapped virus, where the inhibition was reversed by pH 5.5 or 6, albeit pH 5.5 was more efficient than pH 6 (data not shown). Notably, the treatment of cells with pH 5.5 buffer, which leads to acidification of the cytosol [31] did not inhibit HRV1A infection.

We found morphologic alterations of EEA1 positive structures in niclosamide-treated cells, specifically endosomal clustering in the perinuclear area ( Figure 3D , E). The perinuclear intensity of LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1) positive structures was less affected.

To test if niclosamide directly affected the pH within endosomes, we measured the pH of isolated CCV by the AO red fluorescence assay. Niclosamide, BafA1 and ConcA neutralized the pH of CCV in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3F , G), notably with lower IC 50 compared to cellular assays, as seen frequently in cell free assays.

            "text": "Niclosamide is a weak acid with an estimated pKa of 5.6 [33]. At pH 7.4, about 99% of the molecules are in the deprotonated form. The octanol/water distribution coefficient (log P) of niclosamide increases from pH 7.4 to 6 [33] . To test if there was a correlation of antiviral activity and neutralization of endosomal pH, we performed a structure-activity relationship study with a library of sixteen niclosamide-related compounds, each carrying different functional groups. As a positive control we included niclosamide from two different sources, Prestwick and SIGMA-Aldrich, and found that both reagents had a virtually identical efficacy against HRV1A ( Figure 4A ). Four of the sixteen niclosamide-related compounds had antiviral activity, comparable to niclosamide ( Figure 4A and 4B). TVB-1326, 1332 and 1334 all contained features that stabilized their protonated forms, which suggested that the hydroxyl group at R1 or the central amide NH were the pH sensitive group. Condensation of the R1 hydroxyl group with ethoxy-phenyl (TVB-1329) did not diminish the antiviral efficacy compared to niclosamide, indicating that the R1 hydroxyl group alone was not essential. However, substituting the R1 hydroxyl proton with an alkyl group and replacing the electronegative R4 Cl group with hydrogen (TVB-1328, 1331, 1333, and 1324) eliminated antiviral activity. The same was true when the electron-withdrawing nitro group at R6 was replaced by less electron-withdrawing groups (TVB-1338, 1335, 1336) . The importance of the electro-negative groups on the benzene rings was confirmed by the reduced antiviral efficacy of TVB-1323, 1325, 1327, 1330 and 1337.",

Similar to niclosamide, the antiviral active compounds inhibited infection with HRV1A or HRV16 when added during the early phase (30 min) but not when added post entry at 120 min ( Figure S7B in Text S1). CVB3 was only weakly inhibited by the treatment with niclosamide or the compounds TVB-1326, 1332, 1334 and 1329. The inhibition profiles were comparable with the entry inhibitors BafA1 and NH 4 Cl, although NH 4 Cl slightly affected the infection with CVB3. The latter effect is likely due to pleiotropic effects of NH 4 Cl on cell physiology. Furthermore, TVB-1326, 1329, 1332, 1334 but not TVB-1338 readily neutralized acidic endosomes as determined by the ratiometric AO assay or lysotracker fluorescence analyses in HeLa cells ( Figure 4C , D, and Figure S7C in Text S1). Collectively, our studies indicated that the inhibition profile of niclosamide and related compounds against acid-dependent viruses closely matched with the pH neutralization profile of the compounds. Niclosamide neutralizes protein-free acidic liposomes and blocks infection in synergy with BafA1",

Upon short incubation with niclosamide the FITC-fluorescence was rapidly dequenched with half maximal efficacy at 14 mM ( Figure 5A ). Fluorescence dequenching was similar to the protonophores DNP (dinitrophenol) or CCCP (carbonylcyanid-m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone), validating the assay system. Notably, niclosamide did not affect the integrity of the liposomes, indicated by laser scatter size determination and electron microscopy of negative stained liposomes, whereas the detergent Triton X-100 disintegrated the liposomes. These data supplied direct evidence that niclosamide acted as a proton carrier from acidic vesicular lumen to the pH neutral cytosol ( Figure 5B ).",

At low concentrations of niclosamide and BafA1 synergistic inhibition of infection was found as determined with MacSynergy II (Figure S8 in Text S1). The synergistic effects were in strong agreement with results from full cycle assays where low concentrations of niclosamide (0.55 M) or BafA1 (0.5 nM) alone decreased virus titers about five-fold, and with the drug combination .300-fold ( Figure 6C ).

Nitazoxanide was shown to have a broad spectrum of efficacy, albeit with an unknown mode of action. It has anti-protozoan activity and efficacy against influenza virus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, norovirus and is in phase II clinical trials for chronic hepatitis in combination therapy with interferon [38] [39] [40] . It was also reported to inhibit the maturation of influenza virus hemagglutinin, presumably in the Golgi apparatus and to disrupt the membrane potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [41, 42] . Nitazoxanide (pKa 5.8) also has antiviral efficacy against hepatitis C virus (HCV), presumably by activating protein kinase R (PKR) [PKR, 43] . However, using PKR-knock out mouse embryo fibroblasts [44] , we did not find a role of PKR in niclosamide mediated block of infection with HRV1A (data not shown).

            "text": "Here, we show that niclosamide inhibits infection with human rhinoviruses and influenza virus by blocking the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments. Niclosamide did not affect viral uptake into cells, since it acted post conversion of HRV upon receptor engagement and post the 19uC endocytic compartment. Instead, niclosamide acted as a proton carrier and synergized with the inhibitory effects of the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1. This process affects pH homeostasis of endosomes, which is tightly maintained in normal cells, [reviewed in 47] . The mode of action of niclosamide is different from the v-ATPase inhibitor BafA1, or the lysosomotropic agents ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) or chloroquine. The latter are trapped as cationic species in the acidic organelles owing to their basic pKa, thereby elevating the endosomal pH [48] . We speculate that the lower apparent toxicity of niclosamide compared to v-ATPase inhibitors could be due to a pH-tuned action based on the mildly acidic pKa of niclosamide. This would be different from bafilomycin, which blocks the rotation of v-ATPase subunits during proton flux independent of the luminal pH [30] . Niclosamide did not affect the ATP hydrolysis in purified CCV unlike BafA1 and required lower micromolar concentrations for antiviral efficacy than lysosomotropic agents, while NH 4 Cl is effective at low millimolar concentrations [49, 50] . Comparably, chloroquine has an IC 90 of 20 mM for hepatitis C virus [51] , or mono-dansyl-cadaverine has an IC 50 of 50-100 mM against dengue virus [52] . Unlike NH 4 Cl, niclosamide does not apparently induce intracellular vacuolization, suggesting that it does not accumulate in the aqueous lumen of low pH compartments. This is supported by the observation that the hydrophobicity index of niclosamide increases from neutral to acidic pH as shown by experimental data [33] .",

            "text": "Niclosamide acts differently than classical ionophores. Nigeracin, for example, is a mitochondrial proton gradient uncoupler at high concentrations of potassium ions (K + ), and thereby catalyzes the electro-neutral exchange of K + for protons without affecting the membrane potential [53] . The infection block by niclosamide was reversed by addition of low pH medium, suggesting that the endosomal pH rather than a pH gradient across the endosomal membrane is crucial for HRV infection. This is distinct from valinomycin, which disrupts the membrane potential by shuttling Na + and protons. It is also unlikely that niclosamide neutralizes the endosomal pH by inhibition of counter-ion influx, since cation efflux rather than anion influx accompanies endosomal acidification at least in the mildly acidic range [54] . Further, the chemical properties of niclosamide make it unlikely that it acts as an alkali ionophore, such as monensin, which forms zwitter-ionic complexes with monovalent cations and transports them through membranes [55] . Interestingly, niclosamide and its related compounds not only inhibited the pH-dependent viruses HRV1A, 2, 14, and 16, but also, albeit moderately, the less pH-dependent strain CVB4. These results are in good agreement with the infection inhibition profile of EIPA (ethyl-isopropyl-amiloride), an inhibitor of the sodium-proton exchanger regulating endosomal pH [56] . For example, the niclosamide-sensitive CVB4 was as sensitive to EIPA as HRV1A, 2, 14 or 16, while the niclosamideinsensitive CVB3 was not affected by EIPA (data not shown). This suggests that the ionic milieu of endosomes affects infections, possibly by controlling membrane trafficking or homeostasis. This was supported by the observation that niclosamide altered the mildly acidic EEA1-positive early endosomal compartments. It is possible that luminal pH controls the interaction of the membrane trafficking regulator Arf6 with the c-subunit of the v-ATPase complex, and the Arf GTP-exchange factor ARNO with the membrane embedded a2-subunit, which anchors the ATPase complex in the membrane and controls proton transport [57] .",

Niclosamide readily passes through biological membranes due to its lipophilic nature, as indicated by log P = 4.48 at pH 7.0 [33]. Niclosamide (pKa of 5.6) is protonated in the acidic compartment of endosomes, and thereby increases its lipophilicity (log P = 5.63 at pH 5.7). This may enhance its partitioning into the lipid bilayer. In the pH-neutral cytosol a proton dissociates and the compound can interact again with membranes to repeat the cycle.

Preincubating HRV or CVB3 with niclosamide has no effects on infectivity. Figure S3 . Time course of bafilomycin A1 addition to cells infected with HRV1A, 2, 14, 16 and the less pH dependent CVB4, and the pH independent CVB3. Figure S4 . No decrease in antiviral efficacy of niclosamide upon HRV1A passage at low drug concentrations. Figure S5 . Niclosamide is an early and reversible inhibitor of HRV1A, 2, 14 and 16 infections. Figure  S6 . Niclosamide affects acidic compartments similar to BafA1 or ammonium chloride but has no effect on the v-ATPase activity in CCV preparations. Figure S7 . Co-tracking of antiviral efficacy with endosomal pH neutralization of niclosamide-related compounds. Figure S8 . Synergistic inhibition of HRV1A infection by low concentrations of niclosamide and BafA1. (PDF)",
