The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBVinfected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.",

These clinical symptoms were not observed in the INC group. The quantification of the viral load by RT-qPCR showed values ranging from 2.96 \u00d7 10 3 to 3.84 \u00d7 10 8 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA, with the lowest viral load in the jejuna and the highest in the kidneys (Fig. 1B) . It was noted that the viral load in the ilea was much higher than that in the jejuna, reaching 1.39 \u00d7 10 5 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA. No viral RNA was detected in the INC group. There were more goblet cells, which appeared as vacuoles when stained by H&E, in the IIBV group than in the INC group (Fig. 1C , red arrow). In addition, there were many shed villus epithelial tissue that appeared in the ilea of the IIBV group (Fig. 1C , black arrow). Among the ilea, there was no significant difference in villus height (Student's t test, P = 0.094, Fig. 1D ), but crypt depth was significantly increased (Student's t test, P = 0.0003, Fig. 1E ), and the V/C ratio was significantly decreased (Student's t test, P = 0.016, Fig. 1F ).",

As shown by the OTU counts, the number of OTUs in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens was less than that of the INC group chickens (Fig. 2b) . According to the lower ACE and Chao1 indices, NIBV infection reduced the community richness compared to that in the INC group (Table 1 ). In addition, neither the Shannon nor the Simpson indices were significantly different between the IIBV group and the INC group within the experiment (Wilcox, P = 0.5887 and P = 0.9372, respectively). The higher Shannon and Simpson index indicated a higher bacterial diversity, which meant that the NIBV infection decreased the microbial diversity compared to that in the INC group (Fig. 2c,d) . In conclusion, these data indicated a smaller bacterial diversity in the ileal microbiota of NIBV infected chickens.",

As shown in Fig. 3b , the results provided good discrimination between the groups, suggesting that the bacterial community composition of the IIBV group was different from that of the INC group. Simper (similarity percentage) is a decomposition of the Bray-Curtis difference index, which quantifies the contribution of each species to the difference between the two groups.

            "text": "The gut microbiome contains very diverse bacteria and influences myriad host functions 28 . Under pathological conditions, the microbial community composition changes, including an increase and decrease in bacterial populations, causing changes in a wide rage of metabolic functions 32, 33 . Accordingly, it is certainly necessary to understand the bacterial community composition and changes in gut microbiota with IBV infection. However, the composition of the gut microbiota and how the coronavirus can affect the gut microbiota are still unclear. Therefore, the effects of IBV infection on chicken ileum damage and the ileum microbiome were investigated in our study by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been applied extensively for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of metagenomes. It is known that the bacterial 16S rRNA gene consists of nine hypervariable regions, and sequences generated by applying different combinations of these regions generally present differing profiles of microbial diversity. Therefore, the optimal choice of the hypervariable region(s) and primer combination vary between various ecological communities. Previous research proved that the highest bacterial diversity and species richness in chicken gut microbiomes were obtained using the primer set corresponding to the V3-V4 region 34, 35 . Based on these investigations, in our study, we selected primers targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The complete intestinal structure is essential for digestive and absorptive functions which are intimately associated with the morphological transformations in villus length and crypt depth 36, 37 . In the current study, NIBV infection increased the crypt depth and lowered the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the ileum compared to those in the INC group. These findings suggest that NIBV infection can destroy intestinal mucosal integrity and may slow the growth of intestinal villus epithelial cells. Furthermore, it was reported that intestinal goblet cells play a crucial defensive role in the intestine by synthesizing and secreting several mediators, including mucins and trefoil factor family peptides, which serve defensive and healing functions in the gut [38] [39] [40] . In this study, NIBV infection obviously increased the number of goblet cells compared to that in the normal group, which indicated hyperplasia of the goblet cells in the ileum during NIBV infection and may be associated with microbial challenges.",

According to recent research, viral infection can lower microbial diversity in the gut microbiota according to recent research [43] [44] [45] . Consistent with previous findings, in this study, our results demonstrated that NIBV infection decreases the diversity and richness of gut microbiota (Fig. 2c and Table 1 ). The analysis of the taxonomic composition displayed a reduction in the Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria phyla and an enrichment of the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the ilea. Importantly, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, was increased in the ilea www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of NIBV-infected chickens. Moreover, the LEfSe results showed that Enterobacteriaceae belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were over-represented in the IIBV group. Previous research shows that in the case of intestinal inflammation, epithelial cells reduce their capacity to undergo beta-oxidation, with the consequence of an increased availability of oxygen, which is thought to promote the bloom of Proteobacteria and the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota 46, 47 . Further investigations acknowledged that nitrate produced by the host during inflammatory conditions can be exploited by commensal Enterobacteriaceae, which thus become predominant 48 . Therefore, the increased enrichment of Proteobacteria revealed that the intestinal inflammation in the ilea of NIBV-infected chickens represent a \"microbial signature\" of NIBV infection. The results also showed that NIBV infection decreased the abundance of the members of the Cyanobacteria in the ilea compared to that in the INC group chickens. The Cyanobacteria group has great biodiversity due to its secondary metabolites, which show a broad variety of biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulator or protease inhibitor activities 28, 49, 50 . Our results showed a reduction in Cyanobacteria, which indicated that the ability of the chicken ileum to clear viruses was weakened by NIBV infection. Clearly, in the case of viral infection, changes in general metabolic function are closely related to the gain and loss of microbial populations.",

            "text": "Multiple studies suggest that gut microbiota influences the host metabolism 51-53 . Cox et al. showed that disruption of microbiota (reduction in Allobaculum, Lactobacillus, Rikenellaceae and Candidatus Arthromitus (segmented filamentous bacteria, SFB 54 )) can induce obesity 55 . In the present study, we found that Candidatus Arthromitus was dramatically reduced in the IIBV group compared to that in the INC group. However, due to the lack of records of body weight and body fat percentage (BFP) data, it was difficult to verify the direct effect of the reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, such as Candidatus Arthromitus, on the body in this experiment. Fortunately, in the present study, we predicted the unobserved character states in the bacterial community by using PICRUSt, which is generally applied to investigate animal intestinal function 56 . With respect to the PICRUSt results, the \"primary bile acid biosynthesis\" and \"secondary bile acid biosynthesis\" pathways were significantly enriched in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens. Bile acids are cholesterol-derived compounds synthesized in the liver, and gut microbiota can transfer primary bile acids in the small intestine via deconjugation, dehydroxylation, or dehydrogenation to form so-called secondary bile acids, which promote the intestinal absorption of lipids and affect energy metabolism mainly via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) [57] [58] [59] . A great number of observational studies have indicated that meta-inflammatory disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are always associated with an increase in total bile acid (BA) concentrations 60, 61 . In addition, Annika et al. showed that the levels of iso-DCA, which is a common BA produced by bacteria, were significantly increased in humanized mice with low Clostridia abundance. As highlighted above, we know that the enrichment of bile acid biosynthesis is closely related to the loss of Clostridia, which may act as an important part of host metabolism in response to NIBV infections.",
