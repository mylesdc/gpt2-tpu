Recently, a PrP Sc -like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrP C (iPrP C ) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrP C in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrP T183A ) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrP F198S ) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrP C . Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrP C may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrP T183A aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.",

While it has been well documented that PrP Sc is derived from a PK-sensitive cellular PrP C in the central nervous system through an alpha-helix to beta-sheet structural transition, the specific molecular mechanism(s) behind the PrP conversion remain poorly understood [2] . Several plausible theories have emerged, including the prevailing seeding model [3] , which explains this conversion with the use of PrP Sc seeds that are introduced either by exogenous infection in diseases such as kuru, iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD, or formed by endogenous PrP Sc molecules including sporadic CJD and various familial prion diseases. However, the exact molecular nature of the endogenous PrP Sc has not been elucidated.",

All these studies provide experimental evidence that prion-like forms are present at a low level in the normal brain. Such isoforms could be either the silent prions or prion precursors proposed previously [3, 7] or the recognized PrP species implicated in long-term memory in healthy humans [8] . Neuroblastoma cell expressing various human PrP mutants are an essential tool in the study of mutant prions linked to naturally occurring familial prion diseases [9] [10] [11] 6] . Previously, using two models expressing either the mutations at residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrP T183A ) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrP F198S ), we discovered a PK-resistant PrP (PrP res ) species that exhibited higher affinity for anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 1E4, with an epitope between residues 97 and 105 [6] , compared to anti-PrP antibody 3F4, an antibody widely-used in the detection of human prions with an epitope between residues 106 and 112 [12] . Furthermore, we demonstrated that the immunoreactivity behavior and gel mobility of this PrP res is virtually identical to those of PrP *20 that we observed previously in uninfected brain [4, 6] , validating the cell model for the investigation of the spontaneously formed iPrP C .",

            "text": "In this study, using cells expressing PrP Wt , PrP T183A and PrP F198S , we made the following observations. First, these PrP mutations increased aggregation of the protein, of which PrP T183A that has been reported to accumulate intracellularly [10] exhibited the highest amount of iPrP. Second, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that 1E4 had lower affinity for PrP in cultured cells than 3F4, as on immunoblots. Third, glycans at the second site (N197) are basic, whereas glycans at the first site (N181) are acidic. Fourth, the T183A mutation not only abolished glycosylation at N181, but also altered glycosylation at N197. In addition to the immaturity of the glycan at N197 reported previously [10] , the composition of N197 may be also changed, as evidenced by the faster migration of N197 on PK-resistant PrP T183A compared to that of N181 on the PK-resistant PrP F198S or PrP Sc from sCJD. Fifth, the F198S mutation also altered glycosylation at both the first and second sites. The glycosylation on the diglycosylated PrP F198S seemed to be more mature than that on the monoglycosylated protein. Using monoclonal antibodies V14 and V61 that differentiate the two monoglycosylated PrP (Moudjou et al., 2004) , we observed that the mutation blocked the V14 epitope, which was mimicked by reduction and alkylation, a reaction that often breaks disulfide bond and prevents re-oxidation of the thiol group [13] . Although V61 detected unglycosylated PrP and PrP monoglycosylated at N197 (mono197) in the brain PrP, it failed to detect the glycosylated and de-or unglycosylated PrP from cultured neuronal cells. Finally, electron microscopy revealed that while cells expressing PrP F198S enhanced autophagy, PrP T183A seemed to completely inhibit autophagy compared to wild-type cells. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of iPrP C and abnormal folding of mutant proteins.",

We first predicated the effects of PrP T183A The N-linked glycosylation prediction algorithm NetNGlyc 1.0 was then used at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc to predict the likelihood of glycosylation at the two consensus sites. The NetNGlyc server provides a glycosylation potential value between 0 and 1 for each N-linked glycosylation site. A potential value greater than 0.5 indicates that glycosylation is probable at the site. Using this algorithm, the glycosylation potential values of N181 and N197 in PrP Wt were determined to be 0.6636 and 0.7197, respectively. Notably, the potential value was greater at the second site than at the first site in all three species tested (PrP Wt , PrP T183A and PrP F198S ). Glycosylation at only N197, but not N181, was predicted in the PrP T183A mutation (0.7196, almost identical to that of PrP Wt ), while the first and second glycosylation sites were predicted for PrP F198S (0.6633 and 0.6988, respectively). Interestingly though, the potential value at the second site was decreased for www.impactaging.com PrP F198S compared to that in PrP Wt (0.6988 vs. 0.7197), suggesting that the F198S mutation mainly affects glycosylation at N197. The expectation would be that the mutation from Phe to Ser at 198 would increase glycosylation [14] .",

As reported previously [10, 11, 6] , PrP T183A and PrP F198S have altered gel profiles, largely because of the effect of the mutations on glycosylation. Probed with the 3F4 antibody directed against PrP106-110 [12] , PrP Wt migrated as three major bands of one diglycosylated (~36-48 kDa), two mono-glycosylated (~34-36 kDa and ~32-33 kDa, respectively), and one un-glycosylated (27-28 kDa) forms (Fig. 1A , upper panel). In contrast, a single band migrating at 28-36 kDa, corresponding to the monoglycosylated PrP, was detectable in cell lysates from PrP T183A expressing cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel) . Bands migrating at 37-45 kDa and 33-36 kDa corresponding to the di-and monoglycosylated forms, respectively, were detected in cell lysates from PrP F198S expressing cells; the unglycosylated form was undetectable. From these data, we can conclude that PrP T183A mainly contains monoglycosylated PrP at the second site (mono197), whereas PrP F198S contains one di-and two separate mono-glycosylated PrP occupied at the first (mono181) or mono197. After treatment with PK at 25 \u00b5g/ml, no PrP was detected except from PrP T183A expressing cells, in which a weak band with no change in migration remained when probed with 3F4.

In the T183A samples, 1E4 revealed an intense band migrating at 23-25 kDa corresponding to the PKresistant monoglycosylated species (Fig. 1A , lower panel). PrP F198S had two PK-resistant bands: a ~32-39 kDa band corresponding to di-glycosylated PrP and a ~26-29 kDa band corresponding to monoglycosylated PrP (Fig. 1A, lower panel) . Interestingly, the mobility of di-but not mono-glycosylated PrP F198S was slightly slower than that of PK-resistant PrP Sc from sCJD ( Fig.  1A , lower panel) while the mobility of the monoglycosylated PrP T183A (second site) was faster not only than that of the monoglycosylated form of PrP F198S from cell lysates, but also than that of PrP res from the CJD brain control. Because the monoglycosylated PrP T183A carries glycans at the second glycosylation site at residue 197, the monoglycosylated form of PrP res from CJD brains and of PrP F198S from cultured cells with slower migration may represent glycans at the first glycosylation site, residue 181. Another possibility is that the glycans at the N197 site are modified differently and consequently migrate slower than glycans from PrP T183A .",

An intense spot at pH 8.8 was also detected (Fig. 3A , arrow). These spots are believed to correspond to mono197 since the first glycosylation site is eliminated by the T183A mutation. The F198S mutant protein migrated at ~36-38 kDa with pI from pH 4.5 to 5.5. Based on their molecular weights, these spots represent di-glycosylated PrP species (Fig. 3B ). However, spots detected using the 1E4 antibody were more intense and had noticeable differences on both blots. PrP T183A spots detected by 1E4 migrating at ~22-27 kDa corresponding to mono197 were mainly detected in a range from pH 7.5 to 10.0 with faint spots also detectable at pH 4 ( Fig. 3C ). PrP F198S spots were mainly detected between pH 4.5 and 6 migrating at ~35-39 kDa, corresponding to di-glycosylated forms (Fig.  3D ). Two populations of faint PrP spots migrating at ~27-30 kDa were also detected between pH 6.2 and 7.2 as well as between pH 8.0 and 9.5, corresponding to mono181 or mono197. Spots migrating at ~27-30 could be PrP species monoglycosylated at the first site since they shared the similar molecular weight with mono181 identified by 1-D blotting ( Fig. 1 and 3D ), whereas spots between pH 8.0 and 9.5 migrating at ~24-26 kDa could be the monoglycosylated at the second site ( Fig.  3D ).",

Furthermore, these 2-D analyses of glycosylated and deglycosylated PK-resistant mutant iPrP indicated that glycans at the second site are more basic, whereas glycans at the first site are more acidic. 2-D blots, similar to the 1-D immunoblotting, also demonstrated that 1E4 has higher affinity for PK-resistant iPrP compared to 3F4. As indicated above, the effect of the two mutations by themselves on the charge of the proteins was not predicted. Two possibilities that may explain the slight differences in the pH of intense spots after deglycosylation: the three types of proteins have either distinct N-terminal protease cleavage sites or distinct GPI anchors.",

Previous studies indicated that PKresistant monoglycosylated PrP T183A has a molecular weight lower than the PK-resistant monoglycosylated PrP F198S or PrP Sc . This observation may be due to two possibilities: First, there may be abnormal glycosylation at N197 on PrP T183A , even though this mutation directly eliminates N181. Second, the molecular weight the www.impactaging.com glycans is greater in mono181 than in mono197. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with a previous report [16] . In the previous study, two monoclonal antibodies termed V14 and V61 were generated using recombinant sheep PrP as an immunogen to produce glycan-controlled epitopes on the PrP molecule, which discriminate between the two monoglycosylated species [16, 17] . Notably, the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies were identified in 2.5-\u00c5-resolution crystal structures of the PrP-antibody complex; the epitopes could not be mapped using conventional peptide scanning [16, 18, 17] . It was observed that the V14 epitope is localized between sheep PrP188 and 199 corresponding to human PrP185-196, whereas the V61 epitope has not been determined precisely yet. The V61 epitope was deduced to locate in the region before amino acid 171 to the first glycosylation site [16, 17] . Interestingly, although both antibodies recognize unglycosylated PrP, V14 binds to PrP with the first Asn glycosylation site occupied (corresponding to human mono181) and V61 binds to PrP carrying the second glycosylation site (corresponding to human mono197) from sheep, humans, hamsters, and mice. It was also reported that the glycan chain was smaller at the first glycosylation site than at the second site [16] .",

Without PK or PNGase F treatment, five major PrP bands were detected by V14 (Fig. 4A ). Based on the molecular weight, the top band migrating at ~33-35 kDa represents the monoglycosylated PrP species. Since V14 detects PrP species monoglycosylated at N181, this band is mono181. The second band migrating at ~29-32 kDa corresponds to the unglycosylated full-length PrP. The third band migrating at ~ 23-25 is the monoglycosylated C1 fragment with the first site occupied (mono181-C1). The fourth band migrating at 19-20 kDa is the unglycosylated C2 fragment, an endogenously Nterminally truncated PrP fragment detected in CJD brains [19] . Finally, the fifth band migrating at ~18 kDa is unglycosylated C1 that is N-terminally truncated in normal brains [19] . After PK-treatment, only three major bands are detectable with V14. The top band migrating at ~26-28 is PK-resistant PrP monoglycosylated at the first site (mono181 +PK). The second band migrating at ~19 kDa is PK-resistant unglycosylated PrP (Un + PK). The third faint band was detected at ~18.5 kDa. In the samples treated with both PK and PNGase F, only two bands were detectable: the dominant band migrated at ~19-20 kDa, while the other migrated at ~18.5 kDa. Compared to the samples treated with PK, but without PNGase F, the band migrating at ~18.5 kDa significantly increased, suggesting that this new fragment contains both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. Moreover, since it was not detected in the untreated samples, this new fragment could be generated by PK digestion in vitro (Fig. 4A,  left panel) .",

Consistent with the observation by Moudjou et al., the migration of the PrP mono197 detected with V61 was slower than that of PrP mono181 detected with V14 (Fig. 4A) .

After treatment with PNGase F, only two bands were detected, corresponding to deglycosylated full-length at ~29-32 kDa and N-terminally truncated C1 at 18 kDa. V14 mainly detected the unglycosylated PrP T183A migrating at ~29-32 kDa.

Surprisingly, no PrP bands were detected by V61 in all three cell lysates untreated and treated with PNGase F (Fig. 4B, right  panel) . Using the two antibodies we were unable to address issues why the migration of the mono197 from PrP T183A is faster than that of PrP F198S because of inability of V14 to detect PrP F198S and because of inability of V61 to detect both wild-type and mutant PrP from cultured cell lysates. Nevertheless, our current study revealed that V14 identified a C1 monoglycosylated at the second glycosylation site (mono197-C1). Moreover, our new results for the first time indicated that F198S mutation blocked the binding of V14 to PrP and the V61 epitope was completely blocked in both wild-type and mutant PrP from cultured cells.",

The inability of V14 to detect PrP F198S raises two possibilities: First, the residue Phe itself is a key element of the epitope and the F198S mutation completely blocks V14 binding. However, the residue Phe is out of the V14 epitope, as demonstrated by the X-ray crystallography study [18, 17] , which does not support this possibility. Second, although residue Phe itself is not part of the epitope, F198S mutation may affect the disulfide bond between residues 179 and 214, which blocks the accessibility of the V14 epitope. To rule out this possibility, we next used V14 to detect PrP treated with a reducing reagent tributylphosphine (TBP) and an alkylating reagent mechlorethamine (MCT) that break disulfide bond and block the free thiol group.",

The naturally occurring mutations at residue 183, Thr to Ala (PrP T183A ), or at residue 198, Phe to Ser (PrP F198S ), falling in the two consensus sites are linked to two distinct familial prion diseases [22, 23] . Elimination of each of the two sites or two sites together by mutagenesis of hamster PrP in CV1 cells induced the intracellular accumulation of mutant proteins [24] . Lehman and Harris observed that mouse PrP mutated at T182 alone or at both T182 and T198 in CHO cells failed to reach the cell surface but those mutated at T198 did. Moreover, all three mutant PrP acquired PrP Sc -like physicochemical properties reminiscent of PrP Sc while to a limited extent PrP Wt did so only when synthesized in the presence of inhibitor tunicamycin [25] . Using M17 cells expressing human PrP N181G or PrP T183A , Capellari et al. observed that PrP N181G , but not PrP T183A , reached the cell surface even though both mutations eliminated glycosylation at the first site [10] . This indicates that the Thr to Ala mutation itself, not the elimination of the first glycosylation site, altered the physical properties of the mutant protein [10] . Although the F198S mutation falls within the second glycosylation site, Asn-Phe-Thr residues 197-199, PrP F198S slightly increased the efficiency of glycosylation at the first glycosylation site (N181), and greatly increased the efficiency of glycosylation at the second site (N197) in cultured cells [11] .",

In PrP F198S , however, monomeric species were still dominant despite an increase in the amount of aggregates, since the majority of PrP F198S was recovered in the top fractions of sucrose step gradients. The enhanced tendency of PrP T183A to form aggregates may result from the intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. The F198S mutation did not change the ability of PrP F198S to reach the cell surface [11] , although the mutation may significantly change the structure around the V14 epitope previously found to be www.impactaging.com localized between human PrP185-196 [16, 17] . Therefore, the majority of the iPrP C associated with the T183A mutation may be the result of its PrP intracellular accumulation, raising the possibility that iPrP C is derived predominantly from intracellular PrP species. Immunofluorescence microscopy of tagged PrP also indicated that PrP T183A accumulates within the cell, whereas PrP F198S was distributed both inside the cell and on the cell surface, consistent with previous observations [10, 11] .",

On 1-D blots, the migration of the PK-resistant mono197 from PrP T183A was faster than that of PrP F198S and of the dominant monoglycosylated PrP Sc from sCJD, suggesting that the apparent molecular weight of glycans at mono197 is smaller than that of glycans at mono181. However, using two monoclonal antibodies V14 and V61, we demonstrated that the apparent molecular weight of PK-resistant mono197 of PrP Sc from sCJD is greater than that of mono181 of PrP Sc , consistent with the previous finding in scrapie PrP Sc [16] . Thus, the combination of these results provides further evidence to suggest the altered composition of glycans at N197 of PrP T183A . Furthermore, our 2-D analyses revealed that pIs of PK-resistant PrP T183A are basic, while the PK-resistant diglycosylated PrP F198S are acidic. Using Endo H, we confirmed that a large amount of glycans from PrP T183A is immature, as originally reported by Capellari et al. [10] , and our findings support the hypothesis that while only some PrP T183A contains modified glycans (the ~50% Endo H resistant molecules), all of the PrP T183A fails to reach the cell surface. The present study demonstrated that the glycans at either the first or second site were virtually completely digested by Endo H from monoglycosylated PrP F198S . Interestingly, the glycans of di-glycosylated PrP F198S were not significantly digested, suggesting that di-glycosylated PrP F198S are more mature than monoglycosylated forms.",

            "text": "Glycans in mouse and hamster brain PrP Sc have been characterized by mass spectrometry in previous reports [26, 27] . Glycosylation at each of the two N-linked consensus sites of mouse ME7 strain was directly compared by mass spectrometry and differences in Nglycan populations between the two sites were observed [26] . Notably, although both sites contained major neutral components, many other minor neutral components were only observed at the first but not the second site. The majority of glycans at the first site were bi-and tri-antennary structures with a mass range of approximately 1.66-2.34 kDa, whereas the second site mainly contained tri-and tetra-antennary structures with a mass range of ~2.0-3.02 kDa [26] . Therefore, the molecular mass of glycans was greater in the second site than in the first site, having a difference ranging from 0.34-0.68 kDa. The range of oligosaccharides in PrP C and PK-resistant PrP27-30 was found to be identical while the relative proportions of some glycans were different in the two species [27] . Compared to PrP C , PrP27-30 had a reduced bisected and an increased tri-and tetra-antennary glycans [27] . Nevertheless, to date no mass spectrometry analysis of the glycans on the human PrP Sc or the PK-resistant human PrP has been reported, and the glycans on the two monoglycosylated species are not readily differentiated by Western blotting using regular anti-PrP antibodies such as 3F4. www.impactaging.com V14 and V61 are well-characterized antibodies that were generated with the recombinant sheep PrP as the immunogen but are able to discriminate the two PrP species monoglycosylated either at the first or second glycosylation site of sheep, human, hamster and mouse [16] . In addition to recognizing the unglycosylated PrP, V14 also recognizes the PrP species monoglycosylated at the first site, while V61 recognizes the PrP species monoglycosylated at the second site. Using these two antibodies, it was confirmed that the molecular mass of glycans is greater at the second than the first site [16] . Although V14 also detected the di-glycosylated sheep PrP C but it did not detect the di-glycosylated sheep PrP Sc . Our data indicated that the molecular mass of glycans is greater at the second than the first site on the human PK-resistant PrP Sc from sCJD, similar to that observed in scrapie PrP Sc [16] . However, the molecular mass of glycans at the second site of PrP T183A seemed to be smaller than that of glycans on the second site of PrP F198S or brain PrP Sc of sCJD. This provides further evidence that the T183A mutation perturbs the glycosylation at the second site. Furthermore, our present study demonstrated that the PrP F198S species monoglycosylated at the first and second sites were undetectable after the Endo H treatment. Therefore, the F198S mutation similarly alters glycosylation not only at the second, but also the first site. However, the glycans on the di-glycosylated PrP F198S were not cleaved by Endo H, indicating that glycans on the diglycosylated PrP are mature. Although the epitopes of V14, localized at sheep PrP188-199 corresponding to human PrP185-196, and V61, localized at sheep PrP169-174 corresponding to human PrP166-171, were mapped by studying the 2.5-\u00c5 resolution PrP-Fab crystal complex, the conventional peptide scanning failed to localize them on the PrP sequence [16, 18, 17] . As a result, the epitopes have been believed to be conformation-dependent [16] , which is in agreement with our results reported here. We have demonstrated previously that reduction and alkylation blocks the accessibility of the 6H4 epitope but not epitopes of 3F4 and anti-C by breaking the disulfide bond of PrP [13] .",

The V14 epitope was blocked by the F198S mutation as well, suggesting that the F198S mutation may also rupture the disulfide bond. These results parallel discoveries with other conformational sensitive anti-PrP antibodies, including 8H4, which was also reported to have the lower affinity for PrP F198S than for PrP Wt [11] . Unexpectedly, V61 detected no glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP species from all three types of cultured cells even though it detected brain PrP C and PrP Sc . Why the V61 epitope becomes inaccessible in all wild-type and mutant PrP species remains to be determined. Since the amount of PrP Wt used seemed to be large, indicated by V14 (Fig. 4B) , it is most unlikely that inability of V61 to detect PrP from cultured cells mainly resulted from its lower affinity for PrP.",

This natural process normally occurs at a basal level in cells and it can be induced by a variety of conditions [29] . Using electron microscopy, we observed that autophagy was slightly increased in cells expressing PrP F198S compared to cells expressing PrP Wt . Surprisingly, autophagy was dramatically decreased in cells expressing human PrP T183A , which further highlights a possible paradoxical relationship between autophagy and aggregation, since the largest amounts of PrP aggregates were also observed in cells expressing the T183A mutant. It is worth noting that cytosolic PrP aggregates were recently observed to activate reticulon 3 (RTN3), which inhibited autophagy and impeded the clearance of cytosolic PrP aggregates in vitro [30] . Furthermore, it was revealed that RTN3 activation was mediated by the enhanced interaction between Bcl-2 and beclin 1 [30] . Since autophagy is believed to play either a pro-survival or a pro-death role, determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in the induction of autophagy using our cell models would present an important avenue for developing therapeutic strategies for protein folding disorders.",
