We used next generation sequencing (NGs) to investigate the possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis in puppies from a dog kennel in Victoria, Australia. the near complete genome of a canine astrovirus was obtained from pooled faecal samples, and was found to be 94.7% identical with a canine astrovirus detected in the United Kingdom in 2012. The phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene found similarities to those of canine astroviruses identified in Italy in 2005 and in UK and Hungary in 2012, but distant from that of a canine astrovirus previously identified in Australia in 2012. Thus, different serotypes of canine astrovirus are likely circulating in Australia. The close relationship to european astroviruses also suggested that there had been recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses between Australia and europe. NGs also detected other infections in the puppies including several canine papillomaviruses and a canine parvovirus (vaccine strain) as well as a very low level of campylobacter. Canine astrovirus was the probable cause of diarrhoea in these puppies, with the possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria. NGS was effective as a non-targeted method to determine the likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis.",

This may have been the cause of the clinical disease, however a few reads matching bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA belonging to the genus Campylobacter, including the species Campylobacter canadensis and Campylobacter upsaliensis, were also identified among the NGS reads (data not shown). Both of these bacteria are known to cause enteric campylobacteriosis in companion animals and possibly in people [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, the severe clinical disease seen in this case may have been as a result of co-infection with astrovirus and Campylobacter, although it is also possible www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that the astrovirus infection only occurred after an initial Campylobacter infection. The fact that astrovirus was only detected by PCR shortly after clinical disease was observed, and not two and half months later, indicates that this virus was not continually circulating in dogs on the property, and that its presence was at least temporally associated with the clinical disease.",

            "text": "The presence of astrovirus sequences also in a puppy without diarrhoea suggests that astrovirus infection alone may not have been the sole reason for the gastroenteritis or that a difference in immune status may play a role. There are several reports in the literature where astrovirus infection has been associated with gastrointestinal disease in dogs in Australia 14 , UK 15 , China 7 , Korea 27 , Brazil 28 , Italy 5 and Japan 29 , and some reports where it was detected in the absence of clinical gastroenteritis 17, 30 . Similarly, in humans, astrovirus is one of the major cause of gastroenteritis in children 31 , yet asymptomatic infections have also been observed 32, 33 . In this study, we speculate that the astrovirus positive puppies may have differed in their neutralizing antibody levels to astrovirus obtained from their mothers, or in the possible co-infections such as Campylobacter spp. present with the astrovirus, resulting in the difference in their disease status. The low level of parvovirus identified in the puppies appeared to be residual vaccine virus, and was therefore unlikely to be involved in the clinical disease. Ideally, sampling during the episode of gastroenteritis would have allowed better determination of the infections present at the time of the clinical signs, however the value of NGS to detect co-infections is clearly demonstrated here.",

Analysis of the ORF2 region, which is the most variable part of the genome, showed that the closest related sequence was FM213330-AVD-3-Italy-2005, identified in Italy about 12 years earlier. Australia and the United Kingdom/Europe are geographically remote, however dogs do move between these countries, and dog semen is imported to and from Australia for breeding programs 34, 35 . It is therefore possible that an ancestor canine astrovirus was transported to/from Australia through one of these routes. Astrovirus is not currently screened for routinely as part of export/import quarantine requirements and therefore any movement of the virus between countries would have gone undetected at the time.",

This suggested that these viruses possibly belonged to different serotypes. These viruses also fell into different phylogenetic clusters when other sections of the genome were compared. These viruses were identified from dogs in the same geographical region, and this suggests that there is likely a significant diversity of canine astroviruses circulating in Australia. However it would be necessary to culture and isolate this virus in vitro to characterize its serotype, but the adaptation of some astroviruses to grow in cell culture can be challenging 36, 37 and hence it was not done as part of this study. We also detected a low level of canine parvovirus in the samples from the puppies, and sequence analysis suggested that was a CPV2 vaccine virus given to the puppies one week before sampling.",

Older puppies from the kennel in our study had a history of benign cutaneous warts which subsequently resolved. Interestingly, there was also a history of dogs from New Zealand being used in the breeding program at this kennel, which may explain the presence of a highly similar papillomavirus to that seen in New Zealand.

Samples for our study were collected with the consent of the owner in early November 2017, and consisted of faecal samples collected from the ground and saliva samples collected from empty food bowls. Faecal samples were collected immediately after being deposited by individual puppies, while saliva samples were taken by swabbing food bowls immediately after a litter of puppies had emptied and licked the bowls while deposited saliva was fresh. The studies described here were performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations and as only environmental samples were included, do not require animal ethics approval. Swabs were placed in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and stored on ice overnight. The following morning, swabs were aliquoted and frozen at minus 80 \u00b0C until analysis. The samples analysed in the present study included faecal samples from 2 puppies (1 from the group of puppies with prior gastrointestinal disease and 1 from a group of puppies from the litters without signs of disease), and saliva samples from the same two groups of puppies with and without prior disease, respectively. To reduce initial NGS testing costs, the 2 faecal samples were combined and the 4 food bowl swabs (saliva samples) combined, so that the study included a single pooled faecal sample DF-1-2-AUS-2017 and a single pooled saliva sample DS-3-4-5-6-AUS-2017. The four saliva samples were also later processed separately for testing with NGS to better investigate the viruses present in the individual dogs. In mid-January 2018, two and half months after the initial sampling of the puppies, the kennel was revisited and individual faecal samples were collected from 7 dogs aged between 3 days and 2 years old to determine if a canine astrovirus, present at the initial sampling, was still circulating there.",

For NGS, the samples were processed, and virus particles enriched using a protocol optimised in our laboratory described previously 38 . Briefly, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the samples were homogenised at 25 Hz for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 17000 g for 3 min and filtered using a 0.8 um Polyethersulfone (PES) Spin-column filter. The sample was then divided into two, one being ultracentrifuged at 178,000 g for 1 h and the other not ultracentrifuged. Both were then treated with benzonase and micrococcal nuclease for 2 h to enrich for nucleic acids protected in virus particles 38 . Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). An initial RNA denaturation step of 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by snap-cooling in an ethanol-ice bath (minus 20 \u00b0C) was carried out before cDNA synthesis and DNA amplification using the SeqPlex RNA Amplification Kit (Sigma) as per the protocol described 38 Detection of virus in the samples. The sequence data generated for each sample were analysed further for the detection of viruses using BLASTN 39, 40 query with an e-value cut-off score of 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 and BLASTX 39, 40 query with an e-value cut-off of 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 against a local database created from available virus sequences from the NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database (downloaded May 2018) as described previously 38 . Based on the number of high quality reads (initially Q > 20) matched to the reference viruses, and coverage of the reads across the reference genomes, we focused our analysis on 3 viruses of interest present in the samples: canine astrovirus, parvovirus and papillomavirus. The TMAP plugin 41 from the Ion Torrent suite was used for mapping the NGS reads using selected reference genomes of these viruses from NCBI Genbank [see Table S6 for details] which were identified as most similar to the viruses in the dog samples. Near full or partial consensus sequences were generated from the mapped sequences using Integrative Genomics Viewer software (IGV) (Broad Institute, MA, USA) 42 with a mapping quality score of 32 or higher and a coverage depth of at least 2 with further details noted in Results. phylogenetic analysis. The virus consensus sequences were compared with the online NCBI Genbank using BLASTN and the closest related sequences selected for further analyses using MEGA 7 software 43 . For the canine parvovirus 2 (CPV2) comparisons, we also added the available sequences of the CPV2 Protech C3 Vaccine and CPV2 Canigen C3 Vaccine viruses 20 . Sequences were aligned using Clustal-W 44 or in some cases for codon alignments using Muscle 45 . The Maximum likelihood (ML) method with the best fitting model, as determined by MEGA, was selected for generating phylogenetic trees and the robustness of different nodes assessed by bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates for nucleotide alignments and 500 replicates for amino acid alignments. simplot analysis. Similarity plot (SimPlot) was used to observe possible recombination between our sequence and related sequences. A 200 nucleotides sliding window at 20 nucleotides intervals and the F84 distance model with maximum likelihood method was used. Percentage identities at each analysis point were plotted on a line chart 46 . Canine astrovirus partial open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) PCR and Sanger Sequencing. Real time PCR targeting the ORF1b region of canine astrovirus was conducted in order to see if the individual faecal samples were positive or negative for canine astrovirus. Primers (Micromon -Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) were designed to amplify RNA dependent RNA Polymerase gene (RdRP) encoded by ORF1b using Primer Blast and OligoCalc software 47, 48 . TRB-CAstV ORF1b-F3 (5\u2032-TCCATGGGCCTAACAAGCAG-3\u2032) and TRB-CAstV ORF1b-R3 (5\u2032-TGGTTTGAGAAGTGAGGCCA-3\u2032) were used as forward and reverse primer respectively. cDNA was synthesized as described above. The PCR master mix was made with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermofisher Scientific) with 1 mM of each primer and 2 ul of cDNA in a total reaction volume of 10 ul. A QuantStudio \u2122 Flex 6 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplification at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 54 \u00b0C annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec and a final 72 \u00b0C step for 3 min. A melt curve analysis was performed immediately post PCR with reactions subjected to 95 \u00b0C for 15 sec, then 60 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by a continuous temperature ramp between 60 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C increasing at 0.05 \u00b0C/sec. PCR products of ~269 bp size were purified using the 2% Size Select E-Gel System (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). These products were re-amplified by AmpliTaq Gold \u2122 360 Master Mix (Applied Bio systems) using the same primers and PCR program mentioned above.
