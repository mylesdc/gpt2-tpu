The disease also occurs in non-tropical areas of Australia, China and Japan. Globally, BU has been reported in over 30 countries [1] [2] [3] . The burden of BU is however most severe in sub Saharan Africa where the true incidence of the disease is difficult to determine as a result of poor surveillance measures and case confirmation [2] . Available data however reveals an increase in BU incidence over the last several years in the west African countries of Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin. In these countries BU has replaced leprosy as the second most prevalent mycobacterial disease [1] , [3] [4] [5] .",

Microscopic examination detects 29%-78% of clinically suspected BU cases and is currently the only rapid and affordable test available for BU diagnosis in many endemic areas. The detection rate of culture is between 34%-79% and takes an average of 9-12 weeks to yield positive results. Culture therefore cannot be used for rapid laboratory confirmation of BU. Histopathological analysis is reported to detect 30% additional cases than other confirmatory tests, however this technique is restricted to external reference laboratories and are unavailable in peripheral health centres or district or regional hospitals. IS2404 PCR has close to 96% sensitivity and is considered the method of choice for laboratory confirmation of BU [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Thirty clinical specimens from suspected Buruli ulcer patients were investigated by the modified LAMP (or pocket warmer LAMP) and the conventional LAMP, as well as IS2404 PCR, a reference method for the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans. There was no significant difference in the detection rate (63-70%) in all of the methods when purified samples were used for the tests.

This study demonstrates that the LAMP test can be used for rapid detection of M. ulcerans when purified DNA preparations are used.

In a previous study a pocket warmer reached 58uC in 30 min and stayed around 60uC for more than 60 min in a Styrofoam box [34] . The 3 pocket warmers (of a pack of 30 hand warmers) tested in this study achieved a temperature of 60uC after 60 min and maintained this temperature for about 90 min. The pocket warmer thus provided a suitable temperature (60uC) and time range (60 min) for amplification. Both pwLAMP and the conventional LAMP assays were able to detect to the limit of 300 copies of the target sequence after 60 min of amplification. This limit improved to 30 copies when the conventional LAMP was carried out at 65uC (the pocket warmer was not able to attain this temperature and was therefore not investigated). ",
