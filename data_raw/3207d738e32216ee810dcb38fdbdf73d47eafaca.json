In this study, a BALB/c mouse model of sciatic nerve injury was used to explore the role of glycyrrhizin in sciatic nerve repair and its underlying mechanism. Glycyrrhizin with intragastric gavage of 10 and 20 mg/kg weight per day (mid-and high-dose, respectively) inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) expression at the protein and mRNA levels versus the 5 mg/kg (low-dose) group and control (0.9% NaCl solution) at one, two, four and eight weeks following sciatic nerve injury, and simultaneously improved the action potential amplitude and motor nerve conductive velocity. Combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson's silver stain and Luxol fast blue staining results indicated that high-and mid-dose glycyrrhizin promoted improved sciatic nerve myelination compared with the low-dose or control groups eight weeks after injury. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that glycyrrhizin had an inhibitory effect to a certain degree on local hypertrophic scar and inflammatory responses in the mouse model. In conclusion, glycyrrhizin can promote sciatic nerve regeneration and functional repair, in which doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg per day are more effective than lower doses, and such regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR.",

The sciatic nerve injury model was created as previously described (19, 20) , with certain modifications. Briefly, all mice underwent intraperitoneal injection of 3% ketamine using 100 mg/kg weight for anesthesia. The two cm-longitudinal incisions were aseptically made on the unilateral rear thigh. The sciatic nerve cords were completely interrupted at 0.5 cm below the ischial tuberosity and immediately underwent microsurgical anastomosis using 11-0 microsutures (Sharpoint\u2122 MicroSutures, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Finally, the muscle and skin were sutured. Mice were randomized into four groups of 40 mice each and treated with different concentrations of glycyrrhizin for four different time periods. Glycyrrhizin was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and administered intragastrically, daily for 14 continuous days. The final high-, mid-and low-doses were 20, 10 and 5 g/kg weight/day, respectively. An NaCl solution (0.9%) of an equivalent volume served as the control. Mice were sacrificed one, two, four and eight weeks after injury.",

This was verified by measuring the potential amplitude and MNCV in mice. Dual staining of the affected spinal cord segments, L4-L6, connected to injured sciatic nerves, was performed to examine the structural evidence that 10 and 20 mg/kg doses of glycyrrhizin can elevate the number and diameter of myelinated fibers, accelerating nerve regeneration. Subsequently, the GFAP-and NSE-marked fluorescence in astrocytes was employed to assess the nerve damage-associated molecules. Upregulation of GFAP in astrocytes partially marks the formation of glial scars, showing that astrocytes interact with fibrous tissues to reconstruct the glial layers around the central injury core (24, 25) . NSE, a homodimer, is a biomarker for mature neurons and neuroendocrine cells (26) . High-dose glycyrrhizin results in increased NSE and reduced GFAP expression in astrocytes, indicating sciatic nerve repair. Nerve repair and regeneration following injury involves a complex biological process, including an inflammatory response, an adhesion reaction, a synergistic effect of the extracellular matrix, the regulatory function of neurotrophic factors on the regeneration, synthesis and release of a neurotransmitter, the formation and extension of a growth cone and final neuronal regeneration (9, 14) . Following nerve injury, the local excessive immune response leads to expression of inflammatory response genes, forming a local glial scar. This scar can directly affect the recovery of nerve conduction. Reducing the scar can provide a favorable external environment for the repair and regeneration of nerves.",

This downregulation of p75NTR synchronizes the functional recovery of the sciatic nerve, structural myelination and neuronal regeneration and the improvement of molecular markers. Considering p75NTR is an apoptosis-inducing receptor and is associated with the inflammatory response of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , the downregulation of p75NTR may likely result in the reduction of the local inflammatory response, lessening the glial scar and recovering nerve conduction function. Simultaneously, downregulation of p75NTR may attenuate the apoptosis-inducing receptor function of p75NTR, promoting neuronal regeneration and the expression of marker molecules. Therefore, sciatic nerve regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR.",
