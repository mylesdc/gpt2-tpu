Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract (EAFPg) on the LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. Male Swiss mice received either EAFPg at different doses or dexamethasone (per os) prior to LPS intranasal instillation. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Animals were culled at 4 h after LPS challenge, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected for analysis. EAFPg and kaempferol effects on NO and cytokine production by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were also investigated. Pretreatment with EAFPg (100-300 mg/kg) markedly reduced cell accumulation (specially neutrophils) and collagen deposition in the lungs of ALI mice. The same animals presented with reduced lung and BALF TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression in comparison with vehicle controls (p < 0 05). Additionally, incubation with either EAFPg or kaempferol (100 \u03bcg/ml) reduced NO production and cytokine gene expression in cultured LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Overall, these results demonstrate that the prophylactic treatment with EAFPg attenuates acute lung inflammation. We suggest this fraction may be useful in treating ALI.",

ALI incidence remains high, and it is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity worldwide, especially in developing countries [3] . ALI is characterized by intense transepithelial leukocyte infiltration, exudate accumulation in the lungs, loss of integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, and tissue damage [4] . This response has been suggested to be due to the increased production of inflammatory mediators including cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), especially by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils [5] .",

Separation was performed using a Phenomenex Kinetex C-18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Torrance, CA, USA). The column oven was maintained at room temperature. The HPLC was set up with an elution gradient as follows: 0-2 min, 5% B; 2-10 min, 5-25% B; 10-20 min, 25-40% B; 20-30 min, 40-50% B; 30-40 min, 50-60% B; and 40-50 min, 70-100% B. Acetic acid (2%) in Milli-Q water was used as mobile phase A, and methanol was used as mobile phase B. The injection volume consisted of 25 \u03bcl of the reconstituted sample at 5 mg/ml, with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Detection was achieved in a diode array detector (DAD) at 200-500 nm and with direct mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, a method in negative electrospray (-ESI) mode with a detector voltage maintained at 4.0 kV, ion source at 40 V, and capillary temperature at 320\u00b0C. The nebulizing gas was nitrogen (N 2 ) flowing at 7 ml/min, a sheath gas provided at a pressure of 27 psi, while helium was used as the collision gas. Analyses were carried out using full-scan mass spectra and data-dependent MS 2 scans from m/z 100 to 2000. The compounds were identified on the basis of their molecular ion mass fragmentation. The obtained mass spectrum was compared with that of the literature.",

Cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were treated with EAFPg (50-100 \u03bcg/ml), kaempferol (25-100 \u03bcg/ml), or dexamethasone (2-4 \u03bcg/ml) and stimulated with LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml; 30,000 EU/well/100 \u03bcl; Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA), at noncytotoxic concentrations. Then, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Vehicle-(1% DMSO in PBS) treated cells were used as controls. 2.4.2. RT-qPCR Assays in RAW 264.7 Murine Macrophages.",
