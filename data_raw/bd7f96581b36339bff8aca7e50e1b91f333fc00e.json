            "text": "China's healthcare system is experiencing significant growth from expanded government-backed insurance, greater public-sector spending on hospitals, and the introduction of private insurance and for-profit clinics. An incremental reform process has sought to develop market incentives for medical innovation and liberalize physician compensation and hospital finance while continuing to keep basic care affordable to a large population that pays for many components of care out-of-pocket. Additional changes presently under consideration by policymakers are likely to further restructure insurance and the delivery of care and will alter competitive dynamics in major healthcare industries, notably pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and diagnostic testing. This article describes the institutional history of China's healthcare system and identifies dilemmas emerging as the country negotiates divisions between public and private in healthcare. Building on this analysis, the article considers opportunities for public-private partnerships and greater systems integration to reconcile otherwise incommensurable approaches to rewarding innovation and improving access. The article concludes with observations on the public function of health insurance and its significance to further development of China's healthcare system.",

            "text": "Healthcare is arguably the most complex of the institutional systems with which people interact on a regular basis. In every country, healthcare systems combine to differing degrees public state administration and private market economies for insurance and the provision of care. Debates about the superiority of predominantly public or private systems have a strong ideological component, and international comparisons are made difficult by the reality of subtly different mixes of public and private in each country and the shifts induced over time by frequent reforms (Saltman 2003; Weintraub 1997) . Health systems nonetheless exhibit core identities based on the division of power between public and private that are open to negotiation at certain historical moments but otherwise closed off to significant reform possibilities (Rosenberg 2007) . This article finds that that the underlying identity and institutional design of China's health system is presently in flux. As policymakers negotiate what counts as \"public\" and the role of \"private\" in health insurance and the delivery of care, they also are encountering a dilemma between supporting profitseeking industries that offer the potential for new medical products and services but want free-market pricing, and public access to low-cost care that requires redistributive policies and price controls to function efficiently.",

Industry analysts predict healthcare spending in China to grow further to $1 trillion by 2020, which would triple 2010 levels and then comprise an estimated 7 percent of GDP (Le Deu et al. 2012) . Policy discussions concerning where to direct additional public spending and the degree of private enterprise that is desirable in China's future healthcare system are underway following a merger in early 2013 of the Ministry of Health and the National Population and Family Planning Commission to create the National Health and Family Planning Commission (H&FPC). While many analysts expect further liberalization of insurance and hospitals, greater government spending on health also will bring increased regulatory oversight and additional demands for access to care and the protection of public interests.",

China's public has benefitted from a significant increase in lifespan and an 11.5 percent decrease in infant mortality between (OECD 2013 .

A longstanding body of research has examined markets as optimal for the production and exchange of private goods, while government is needed to generate public goods and regulate areas subject to market failure (Samuelson 1954; Breyer 1982) . But as the economist Kenneth Arrow (1963) suggested, the provision of medical care is complicated since it exhibits dimensions of public goods (e.g., preventing disease contagion or keeping people productive) and private goods (e.g., seeing a physician or purchasing prescription drugs). As a consequence, nearly every country's healthcare system has a mix of public and private insurance, public and private delivery of care, and public and private support for the development of new medicines and treatments (Johnson and Stoskopf 2010) .",

Large urban hospitals (tier-II and tier-III hospitals in China's domestic ranking system, under which tier-III are the best) earn revenue from markups on diagnostics and drug sales, leading direct financial incentives for doctors to over-prescribe brand-name drugs and diagnostic tests (Ramesh et al. 2013) . Medical infrastructure varies tremendously among regions and capital spending lags other sectors. The insurance system is underdeveloped and consumer information necessary for effective risk management and risk pricing is lacking. The quality of medicines varies widely and counterfeits of prescription drugs and traditional Chinese medicines are widespread. Thanks to the interconnected nature of the healthcare system, any regulatory changes will have repercussions on incentives for physicians, hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device firms.

Physicians and trained medical personnel likewise moved to cities; in the space of fifteen years, township health centers across China lost nearly all of their qualified doctors (Gong and Wilkes 1997). As the economy grew at double-digit rates, a middle class emerged. However, few employers provided health insurance and only expatriates had access to private insurance.

            "text": "Starting in the mid-2000s, the Chinese government began to increase spending on healthcare, mostly to expand insurance coverage but also for biomedical infrastructure of hospitals and research facilities (Barber and Yao 2011). A series of pilot projects begun in 300 rural counties in 2003 subsequently evolved into the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on the national level (Zhang et al. 2010 ). Restricted to rural participants, NCMS offers very basic subsidized insurance to households. At its origin, a typical insured member paid an annual contribution of 10 RMB ($1.60) b , with additional contributions by the central and local governments of 20 RMB each; premiums and coverage subsequently rose, though only modestly. Administration of NCMS and coverage decisions are the responsibility of local governments, who manage budgets by setting reimbursement limits. At present, coverage is limited to inpatient care and annual ceilings per patient are used to control expenditures. In 2012, the government set a common formula for coverage limits of eight times average annual farm income, but not less than 60,000 RMB ($9,600). NCMS operates on a local basis, and deductibles and copayments typically increase for treatment away from home (Brown and Theoharides 2009). Although NCMS is voluntary, it was designed from the start with sufficient scale to allow for risk pooling. The central government encouraged provinces to actively build membership through a baseline requirement of 80 percent participation for receipt of subsidies (You and Kobayashi 2009) . While payment models such as capitation were used on an experimental basis in the early 2000s, fee-for-service emerged as the dominant approach by the end of the decade. Studies of NCMS have found that the utilization of services rose, but its implementation also increased out-of-pocket spending since insurance did not cover chronic disease care or most branded prescription drugs (Yip and Hsiao 2009; Wagstaff et al. 2007) .",

Government leaders including former Health Minister Zhu Chen have commented openly on the need to improve hospital efficiency and deal with public concerns regarding \"poor access and high fees\" (Fei 2012) . Hospitals nevertheless are public in ownership and financing, even as a small number of specialty clinics and VIP treatment centers with a maximum of 50 beds have been licensed in wealthier cities.",

Clinics such as those operated by Parkway Health, a Singaporean company, offer better facilities and advance scheduling of doctor visits and surgical procedures. Private clinics employ the same physicians that work in public hospitals, but with significantly better compensation. Wealthier patients enjoy a better experience of high quality facilities and minimal wait times even as some of the population pressure on the public system is reduced. However, this initially modest degree of privatization could evolve to better care for the wealthy and greater social fragmentation. Supporters of private care delivery argue that physicians will continue to work in public hospitals for career advancement and prestige even as they offset poor compensation from public hospitals.",

Base salaries are notoriously low, with a national average of only 4,200 RMB monthly ($672) (Chinese Medical Doctor Association 2011). Even in top-tier cities, such as Shanghai, monthly pay starts at 5,000 RMB ($800) for young doctors and rises to just 10,000 RMB ($1,600) for experienced physicians. But doctors typically also receive a significant yearly bonus that adds 40 percent or more to their salaries. Bonuses are based on the hospital's overall revenue or the quantity of services a physician provides, including admissions, medical procedures, tests, and prescriptions (Yip et al. 2010) . In a study critical of the practice, public health scholars noted that admissions had doubled and the frequency of operations tripled at hospitals that implemented revenue-related bonus systems (Liu and Mills 2005) . Overall, concerns have been raised that Chinese doctors are implicated in a system with financial incentives to provide unnecessary care. Physicians and ethicists warn that medical judgment is being distorted (Chen 2007) .",

As part of the 2009 reforms, the government reversed previous plans to phase out 3-year programs and instead refocused them on training for rural primary care. Even as the country struggles with a shortage of primary care physicians, concerns have been raised that medical schools admit too many students, weakening the quality of education and generating a shortage of clinical internship positions (Ba 2007) . The combination of openings for students but low compensation for physicians has produced a peculiar employment dynamic in China. Until the late 1990s, nearly every new doctor went to work as practicing physicians. But in the decade between 2000 and 2010, the majority of medical graduates found employment outside of general medicine, often for pharmaceutical or medical device firms (People's Republic of China 2012b).",

Tensions have mounted with a spate of attacks on medical personnel by patients and their families, averaging one per month in 2010 and 2011 (Jiang 2011; Yingqi 2011). c For their part, physicians express severe stress concerning workload and poor pay. Doctors commonly see twenty or more patients per hour and in some clinics, patients pile into doctors' offices while jostling for a position. Noting the challenges for physicians, the vice minister of health, Huang Jiefu, stated, \"How could a doctor maintain a good attitude for all day long, with no time to take a rest, to drink, and to go to the toilet?\" (Fei 2012 ). According to a poll conducted by the Chinese Medical Doctor Association in 2011, 95 percent of physicians are dissatisfied with wages, which are just 20 percent above the national average for all workers (Chinese Medical Doctor Association 2011).

Countries worldwide are struggling to treat rising numbers of patients with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. New treatments are likely to require health and genetic data from large patient populations, in addition to big clinical trials. Combining a growing scientific workforce and a large patient population, China has the potential to build domestic firms that develop and market drugs globally and build clinical trials into a profitable international service business. Drug development, including pre-clinical discovery, the modification of compounds to make them safer and more effective, and clinical testing all remain underdeveloped in China. Seeking to overcome technical barriers, government-sponsored projects are underway to develop standards for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and other aspects of drug formulation. But policy concerns about multinationals exploiting Chinese patients have led to a process requiring 10 to 18 months to authorize new trials. Likewise, accreditation of clinical trial sites in China requires national and local government reviews taking six months or more (Le Deu et al. 2012) .",

The country's potential to emerge as a global leader for clinical trials was downplayed by analysts in the mid-2000s, who instead expected India and Russia to dominate (Bailey 2006) . However, India has advanced policies that strongly favor generic drug firms while trials in Russia have proven difficult to manage.

Health economists have suggested that in an optimal co-insurance model, individuals are covered for unexpected or financially catastrophic disease, but do not pressure physicians for excess treatment since they must pay for it directly (Ma and McGuire 1997; Eggleston 2000) . In China, however, out-of-pocket spending is extremely high and contributes to a worldleading savings rate. In effect, the Chinese are deferring present consumption out of concern for future medical bills. Proposals for new government-backed catastrophic plans seek to create a broader redistribution system. Under this scenario, China will have public insurance at the top and bottom of the cost scale, and out-of-pocket or private insurance for the middle. However, that development may severely constrain the development of private insurance by making it too difficult for insurers to create profitable patient pools.

Public hospitals, which bill patients at government-set prices at the point of service are not equipped to handle post-hoc private insurance reimbursement. But investors need to be convinced of the viability of private insurance plans in order to underwrite new private clinics. An integrated insurance and care delivery model could break through this dilemma only if it simultaneously recruits respected physicians and a broad enough pool of customers that pay annual insurance premiums. If private insurance develops in this manner, it will reduce some of the pressure on the public system but raise tensions concerning inequality of access to top care facilities and providers.",

Alternatively, a fully free-market system might better reward physicians and promote innovation, but at the expense of universal insurance and access. Central planners hold a vision of state-run institutions at the center, for-profit firms in supplementary roles, and other nonprofit health entities making contributions through nursing homes and end-of-life care (National Development and Reform Commission 2009).
