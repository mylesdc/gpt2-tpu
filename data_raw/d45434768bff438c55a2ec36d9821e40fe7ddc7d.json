            "text": "Glycans are multi-branched sugars that are displayed from lipids and proteins. Through their diverse polysaccharide structures they can potentiate a myriad of cellular signaling pathways involved in development, growth, immuno-communication and survival. Not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ML6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ML6 displays antitumor activity that is >10 5 times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. This activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ML6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield na\u00efve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. Thus, ML6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydratedirected therapies. Further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ML6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer.

            "text": "The outer surfaces of mammalian cells are decorated with a complex array of branched carbohydrates attached to membrane proteins or lipids, collectively referred to as glycans [1] . Structural diversity of these molecules leads to a broad spectrum of biological functions, where glycans play key roles in protein folding, modulation of immune responses and wound healing, to name a few [2, 3] . Dysregulation of glycosylation is also central to the initiation and progression of various human diseases. For example, early stages of cancer are characterized by impairment of normal glycosylation pathways that ultimately produce incomplete glycan structures [4] . Conversely, changes in gene expression in advanced cancers can lead to the de novo synthesis of unique glycans [5] . Collectively, this aberrant glycosylation can inhibit immune-mediated destruction of tumor cells and induce signaling pathways that promote carcinogenesis, tumor metastasis and contribute to drug resistance [6] . Despite the link between defective glycosylation and malignancy, the glycome of many tumor types remains largely unknown and, along with it, a wealth of potentially novel targets for therapies [3, 4] . Molecules capable of distinguishing altered expression of glycans on malignant cells represent powerful biochemical tools to probe pathways important to cancer biology, and in some cases also disrupting cell functions to serve as potential therapeutics. One such class of agents are lectins, which comprise a diverse family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that recognize and bind to glycans with sugar-specificity. Lectins are found in organismal proteomes [7, 8] , and secretomes [9, 10] across all kingdoms of life, and have a variation of ligand selectivity that rivals' that of antibodies. In many cases mammalian cell-surface binding of lectins, and subsequent intracellular transport, can modulate a manifold of biologic pathways with remarkable potency [11] . For instance, less than 2 mg of ricin, a ribosome-inactivating lectin produced by the castor bean plant [12] , is sufficient to kill an average sized human. A more positive example is the human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a component of the innate immune system, which is responsible for binding to the high-mannose glycoprotein coat of pathogenic microbes and apoptotic cells to promote their destruction and removal [13] .",

For example, a mannose-binding lectin from red-algae has nanomolar inhibitory activity against HIV, hepatitis C, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola viruses, while displaying no deleterious effects on human immune cells and rodent animal models [14] . In one notable study, mice treated with a high-dose of a recombinant mannosespecific lectin survived otherwise fatal Ebola viral infection and became immune to virus rechallenge [15] . Interestingly, an individual human's expression level of MBL also affects incidence and severity of certain cancers [16] , suggesting that, in addition to their antiviral activity, lectins may also play central roles in tumor prevention and therapy.",

For this purpose we used a database of bacteriocins (http://bagel2.molgenrug.nl) as Blast query sequences. Searching for bacterial genes in sequences of eukaryotic soil microbes was motivated by the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfer may have occurred. The best match from this search involved the query protein putidacin_L1 (Pseudomonas sp.; 31% identical amino acids and 130-144 mismatches out of 230 aligned amino acids, bitscore = 66). This is a weak match, as expected given that we were looking for horizontally transferred genes. Putadicin_L1 contains two canonical mannose-binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), involved in alpha-D-mannose recognition. This query sequence, and more specifically its mannose-binding domains, aligned to two sequences from Virola surinamensis roots, Virola_comp126176_c0_seq1, and Virola_comp114133_c0_seq1. Deduced proteins from these sequences contain 12 and 6 mannose-binding domains, respectively. Nine of the domains in Virola_comp126176_c0 are different from each other, as are all six in Virola_comp114133_c0_seq1. This diversity of binding motifs caught our attention as it suggested that minor changes in a particular glycan on target cells could reduce binding with one particular mannose-binding motif, but not others, making these lections somewhat \"evolution proof\". Hence, these looked like versatile and possibly useful mannose binding lectins. To our knowledge, high valency of mannose-binding domains and sequence diversity among those domains has not been used to select lectins for testing as reagents, therapeutics, and other applications.",

            "text": "Within libraries of poly-adenylated gene models (i.e. eukaryotic) obtained from de novo transcriptomes of six species of tropical tree seedling root samples [17] , we performed bioinformatic searches to discover potentially bioactive proteins. Among these we identified a diverse library of >80 novel lectins. Notably, species-rich rainforest root communities [17] [21] comprise mutualists, saprophytes, pathogens [22] , and even predators (fungi that use lectins to trap and eat nematodes [23] ). This diversity suggests that some of the identified proteins in this community may be involved in between-species interactions [24] , and potentially serve as components of defensive or offensive systems that may have co-evolved with rival organisms. The first lectin we examined for functional properties was based on a sequence obtained from the roots of Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae). A double-stranded DNA was synthesized (IDT gblocks 1 ) using codons optimized for bacterial expression and produced in E. coli as a recombinant protein (see methods). This 28,058 Da protein (Fig 2A, S1 Fig) , named ML6 (Mannose-binding Lectin 6), contains six unique instances of the canonical QxDxNxVxY domain (where X can be any amino acid) characteristic of bulb-type lectin mannose-binding domains (Fig 2A) . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirm that recombinant ML6 binds to monosaccharide mannose haptens with high affinity (K d = 1.5 \u03bcM; S2 Fig) . Although the species origin of this lectin is unknown, a mycologic assay found that it inhibits the growth of the pathogenic plant fungus Mycosphaerella zeae (S3 Fig). This antifungal activity suggests ML6 may be produced by a mutualist that defends tree seedlings from pathogenic fungi or competes in some other ecological context. Interestingly, ML6 has only 39% overall amino acid identity to known proteins (NCBI protein and translated nucleotide databases), while the additional 80 lectins in our library have <60% amino acid identity with sequences in any database. This low identity suggests ML6, along with the other lectins in the library, come from species fairly distant from taxa with characterized genomes, and thus may have unique protein conformations and potentially novel biochemical functions.",

However, ML6 exhibits a number of unique and important differences. Most known \u03b2-protein lectins display 1-3 monosaccharide binding sites, and associate into homo-dimers, homo-tetramers, or homooctamers to increase their effective valency [26] [27] [28] . These arrangements enhance the capacity, potency, and specificity of lectins to bind their sugar targets, particularly complex N-linked glycans [29] . Uniquely, ML6 possesses six mannose-binding domains, all of which have divergent sequences relative to each other and are spaced in close proximity (22-25 amino acids separate domains ; Fig 2A) . This domain number and arrangement are in stark contrast to well-known plant mannose-binding lectins like Galanthus nivalis agglutinin 1 and 2 (GNA-1/ 2), which possess two mannose-binding domains in the monomer that are separated by~50 residues [30, 31]. Thus, ML6 is unusual in its ecological and taxonomic (albeit unknown) origin, monomeric composition, and diversity of mannose-binding domain sequences. ",

For example, garlic bulb (Allium sativum) lectins were found to have inhibitory effects on lymphoma cells at concentrations >0.5 mg/mL [33] . Similarly, lectins isolated from the plant Clematis montana displayed potent antineoplastic activity towards human breast, ovarian, and liver cancer cell lines [34] . With this background in mind, we screened the toxicity of ML6 against a panel of human cancer cells and normal cell line controls. Results (Fig 3A and Table 1 ) demonstrate that ML6 elicits picomolar toxicity toward five of the tested cell lines, including A549, OVCAR-3, HeLa, T24 and Caco-2. Remarkably, for the most sensitive cell line in the panel, A549, ML6 was active even at femtomolar concentrations (IC 50 = 40 fM; 1.2 x10 -9 mg/mL). Competitive inhibition assays demonstrate that the activity of ML6 is critically impaired upon co-incubation with excess mannose (S5 Fig), suggesting mannose-binding is fundamental to ML6's mechanism of action. Active concentrations of ML6 yielded a stark change in A549 cell phenotype after 24 hours of incubation, characterized by the presence of large intracellular vacuoles and contraction of the cell membrane (Fig 3B,  Top) . These morphologic changes were not observed for the ML6-insensitive MCF-7 cell line treated under similar conditions (Fig 3B, Bottom) . Taken together, these results support our assertion that ML6 avidly interacts with monosaccharide mannose haptens, and suggests that binding to mannose residues on cell surface glycans is a prerequisite for ML6-mediated anticancer activity.",

Conversely, ML6 was found to be inactive towards both of the tested non-mucosal cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Jurkat), as well as three non-cancerous controls (Fig 3A and Table 1 ). Calculating selectivity Table 1 indices for each cell line (SI; Table 1 ) reveals that ML6 is >100-10,000 times more active towards mucosal cancers than non-malignant cells. This mucosa-specific activity of the lectin is perhaps not surprising given the dense glycocalyx of mucosal epithelium, where surface displayed glycans operate as key intermediaries between cells of the respiratory, urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts and the external environment. For example, mucin-type glycoproteins expressed on epithelia provide important defenses against toxins and pathogenic microorganisms [35] . Abnormal expression of these mucins is a common phenotype of epithelial malignancies, where they play central roles in cancer pathogenesis [36, 37] .",

This decoration of the cell surface by lectins did not result in significant cell-cell agglutination To test the cell-specificity of ML6 binding we performed similar microscopy experiments using the insensitive cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines MCF-7 and NL20, respectively (Fig 4B & 4C) .

This was performed by hybridizing ML6 to an array of 300 different glycans that encompass both synthetic polysaccharides as well as natural N-glycans, glycolipids, human milk oligosaccharides, and tandem epitopes. This analysis revealed high-specificity of the lectin towards five short, mannose-rich N-glycans (Fig 5A and S2 Table) . Among these putative targets is a conserved structural subunit: GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,2-Man-\u03b1-1,3-Man-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc. Given that this carbohydrate pentamer is present in the stem of all human glycans, our results suggest ML6 does not target a unique tumor glycan, but more likely that the accessibility of this motif is increased on aberrant and incomplete glycans overexpressed on the surfaces of malignant cells. Further supporting this assertion is the fact that ML6 did not bind to glycans with identical carbohydrate backbones, but which were terminated with sialic acid (Fig 5B) . Sialic acids are typically found terminating the branches of fully formed glycans and have been reported to 'hide' mannose antigens on the surfaces of cells from immune-activating MBLs [39] . Taken together this suggests that ML6 may differentiate healthy and malignant cells by binding GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,2-Man-\u03b1-1,3-Man-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc units on na\u00efve and incomplete glycans produced by mis-regulated glycosylation pathways in tumors. This conserved motif of N-glycans may also be more sterically shielded on 'healthy' hyperbranched glycan structures capped with terminating sialic acid residues. In addition, ML6 did not bind to a Discovery of antitumor lectins from rainforest tree root transcriptomes short glycan in which mannose disaccharides are joined through an \u03b16-linkage (see fourth entry from the top in Fig 5B) , while a similar backbone with \u03b13-linked subunits was a target for the lectin (see fourth entry from the top in Fig 5A) . This glycan specificity demonstrates that stereochemical orientation of the divalent mannose moiety in the carbohydrate backbone is also integral to ML6 binding activity.",

This distribution pattern may indicate both surface and intracellular locations where ML6 elicits pleiotropic anticancer effects. For example, programmed cell death occurs through extrinsic or intrinsic pathways: death-receptor (extrinsic) mediated apoptosis triggered by the ligation of Fas or other plasma membrane receptors, and a mitochondriadependent (intrinsic) pathway induced by the release of cytochrome c. A number of recent studies have shown that plant lectins can modulate extrinsic apoptosis signaling in cancer cells by activating cell surface death receptors that include TNF, TRAIL and FasL [47] .

Intracellular abundance of this glycan in the pathway is altered by the Man2a1 enzyme, as well as substrates, co-factors, and nearby enzymes in the biosynthetic process [51] .

Given this link, there is clinical interest in developing protein-based therapies in oncology that target and inhibit N-glycosylation pathways [54] .
