Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic. The objective of our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies implemented in Egypt. In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt. Then, we assessed the risk of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using a multi-criteria evaluation approach. Finally, we combined the animal trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely. Our results indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then, they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing) seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction, and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed.",

            "text": "Introduction Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus which belongs to the Phlebovirus genus, within the family Phenuiviridae (order Bunyavirales). It is the causative agent of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that may affect both humans and animals, mainly ruminants, but also camels. In livestock RVF causes large number of abortions (abortion storms) and high mortalities in young animals. In humans, RVFV infection generally causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness, although in some cases disease progresses to more severe forms, with neurological disorders, blindness, hemorrhagic fever or thrombosis [1] . RVFV infection of animals may occur by the bite of an infected mosquito (mainly of the Culex or Aedes genera) or through direct contact with infected animal tissues or fluids [2] . Infection via mosquito bites is considered the primary mode of transmission in the first stages of the epidemic, while contact with contaminated material is more relevant during the amplification stage. RVFV within infected tissues is quite resistant to inactivation and may remain infectious for a few days [2] . In fact, the majority of human cases are likely to occur in farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse employees due to contact with infected material [3] .",

            "text": "The continuous importation of viraemic ruminants or camels, mainly from Sudan, was considered the main source of introduction of RVF into Egypt [6] . Furthermore, those importations may also result in the introduction of other exotic diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8] . RVF is considered to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with major outbreaks associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding [9] . Socio-economic changes, with human population growth and the associated increased demand for meat, or changes in the meat market prices could result in greater controlled and uncontrolled transboundary movements of livestock. A consequence of all those changes would be an increase of the risk of introduction of RVFV into areas of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East [3] . While surveillance and diagnostic methods for RVFV are available, RVFV control is hindered by the difficulties of vector control, and the fact that vaccines are only available for ruminants, with either inactivated vaccines (with a limited efficacy) or live attenuated vaccines (with a residual pathogenic effect) [3, 10] . Therefore, the best strategy to protect countries at risk of RVFV introduction is the implementation of regional monitoring and control programmes in endemic countries, as well as the establishment of early warning systems in the countries at risk. The Egyptian authorities implement both measures to prevent the introduction of RVFV (vaccination of imported animals, quarantines and testing of a proportion of imported animals) and measures to prevent the spread (vaccination of the Egyptian susceptible population). If those measures were effective, there would be no risk of RVFV introduction and spread, however, their efficacy has not been evaluated, and some deficiencies have been identified in the past [6] . Given the limitation of resources, risk-based methods (i.e. focusing on those areas and/or practices that pose the highest risk) may be considered as a cost-effective alternative for the surveillance of RVF in Egypt. Many of those risk-based methods are data-driven, which rely on comprehensive information about disease-associated events. In a data-scarce context, knowledge-driven methods, which rely on the previous information on the factors associated with disease occurrence, offer an alternative approach to identify areas at risk [11] .",

Cattle, sheep and goats density maps were obtained from the FAO-Gridded Livestock of the World modelled data [15] . For buffaloes and camels, as density raster maps were not available, the data on the number of animals by governorate was obtained from OIE-WAHID, densities were calculated and maps were rasterized. Density maps for the different species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are shown in Fig 1- upper row. All animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year (MALRE personal communication). Data on the number of vaccine doses administered the first and second semesters of 2014 and 2015 by animal species and governorates were provided by the ED-MALRE. For the year 2015, the vaccine coverage (i.e. the proportion of animals correctly vaccinated, that is, that received two vaccine doses) by species and governorates were calculated taking into account the censuses by species for the different governorates (Fig 1-middle row) . By multiplying the animal density data layer by the vaccine coverage layer, we obtained a layer of the density of susceptible animals by species (Fig 1-lower row) . Then, the weights for the relative susceptibility of the different host species (see below the determination of weights) were applied, and the results combined to produce a map to represent the density of all susceptible hosts. Finally, that map was standardized, i.e. put in a continuous scale from 0, equivalent to the minimum value (density), to 1, equivalent to the maximum value (density). Standardization allows the combination of layers with different characteristics/units to produce the final risk maps. Mapping the distribution of Cx. pipiens. Culex pipiens has been traditionally considered the main vector of RVFV in Egypt [16] , and recent entomological studies seem to confirm that [17] . In fact the competence of Egyptian Cx. pipiens for RVFV transmission was demonstrated experimentally [18] . Other species potentially involved in RVFV transmission is Cx. antennatus, considered by Gad and collaborators [19] as an important secondary vector of RVFV in Egypt. Cx. antennatus is found in every governorate of Egypt, and their primary breeding include flooded areas, rice fields and irrigation channels [20] .",

Then, a linear regression model was fitted to the data, and the contribution of each factor to the variation of the risk of RVFV transmission was calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares related to that factor on the total sum of squares of the model.",

In order to validate the risk of RVFV transmission map, data on any previous outbreak of RVFV occurred in Egypt for which the location was available was collected from several sources. For the 1977 epidemic data on the location of several outbreaks which affected humans and animals were reported by Meegan [5] . Affected locations included the villages of Bilbeis, Zagazig and Inshas (in Sharqia governorate), El Khanka (in Qalyubia governorate) and Imbaba (in Giza governorate). For the 1993 epidemic several outbreaks affecting cattle, sheep and goats were reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health [25] in the villages of Kom Ombo, Edfu and Al Balyana (in Aswan governorate). In the 1997 epidemic, outbreaks in cattle and sheep were reported in the villages of Daraw (in Aswan governorate) and Manqabad and Durunkah (in Asyut governorate) [26] . In 2003, repeated cases of RVF in humans were reported to the World Health Organization [27] in Seedy Salim district (in Kafr Al-Sheikh governorate). Besides, from 297 pools of female mosquitoes collected in Kafr Al-Sheikh governorate, RVFV was isolated in 3 pools of Culex antennatus (Becker) from 2 different sites. In 2012, an outbreak of RVF in cattle was reported by FAO in the village of Al Khwajat (in Faiyum governorate), although the case was not confirmed by the Egyptian Authorities [28] . In total, 16 outbreak locations were used for the validation of the risk map.",

During the period 2012-2015, 762,291 camels were legally imported into Egypt, 79.4% of which came from Sudan, and the rest (20.6%) from Ethiopia. The temporal pattern (Fig 2) evidences a continuous flow all the months between 2012 and 2015. However, throughout this period there were some significant variations. From January 2012 to July 2012, the average number of camels imported per month was above 20,000. After that, and until the end of 2013, the number decreased to about 12,000. Then, importations progressively increased to about 15,000 in 2014 and 18,000 in 2015 (Fig 2) . That increase coincided with the intensification of the trade with Sudan, as the number of camels imported from Ethiopia actually decreased. No seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported into Egypt throughout this period. a) Importation of camels from Sudan: of all the camels imported in 2015, 139,664 (63% of the total) arrived from Western Sudan to Abu Simbel quarantine in South-Central Egypt (Fig  3) .

The weights for the relative susceptibility of the different host species, determined by the paired comparison method developed by Saaty [23] were 0.32 for sheep and goats and 0.12 for cattle, buffaloes and camels.

            "text": "Camel meat is an important source of cheap protein for the Egyptian people. However, as the resident camel population in Egypt is really small, 66,233 animals in 2015 (according to OIE data) and located mainly in remote areas, large number of camels need to be regularly imported into Egypt, the majority of which come from Sudan (86% of the total in 2015) and the rest from Ethiopia. The flow of camels is continouos throughout the whole year and the number of animals imported per year seem to have an increasing trend. In 2015, an average of 18,000 camels were imported per month. During the first RVF epidemic in Egypt in 1977, mortality and abortions were reported in camels in Aswan governorate (in the south of the country), and RVFV was isolated from this species [32, 33] . Therefore, even though the source of the outbreak could not be determined, the possibility of introduction of the disease from Sudan by camels was considered the most likely explanation. In the following epidemics (1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003) , importation of camels, mainly from Sudan, was also considered as a possible source of introduction, although no proper epidemiological investigations were carried out, and alternative mechanisms were considered [6, 26] . As a result, the role of camels in the epidemiology of RVFV remains unclear. In fact, it has been suggested that camels may be essential for RVFV transmission in some ecosystems where their density is high, which would allow viral amplification and transmission to alternative hosts, but not in others [34] . Furthermore, data on factors such as duration of viraemia, infectiousness to mosquitos, or the risk of infection of humans from contaminated products remain unknown, and further studies on camels would be required. Despite those uncertainties, camels are considered susceptible to RVFV, and the virus has been isolated from blood from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan [32, 35] . While RVFV infections in camels are usually mild or asymptomatic, abortion waves were observed in RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt [34] . In the 2010 epidemic in Mauritania, clinical signs other than abortions were observed in camels, either a peracute form with sudden death within 24 hours; or an acute form with fever and systemic lesions, that resulted in death when haemorrhagic signs occurred [36] . RVFV infections in camels have been recorded in most sub-Saharan African countries, with prevalences ranging from 3.0 to 51.9 percent [34] . In fact, RVF is thought to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with large epidemics occurring after heavy rainfall and flooding [9] . Phylogenetic analyses carried out in Sudan with RVFV strains from the 2007 and 2010 epidemics, indicated that they were the result of multiple introductions from eastern Africa [37] . Since then, there were evidences of circulation of RVFV during the inter-epidemic period: in 2014-2015, 9.6% of camels in Khartoum State (Sudan) had RVFV antibodies, including at least one positive born after the last reported epidemic [38] .",

In contrast to camels, the data revealed a more seasonal pattern, with an increase of importations in the months of July, August and September, just before the major Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha (\"Sacrifice Feast\") in those years. Importation of cattle also poses a threat for Egypt, in fact, the epidemics of foot and mouth disease (serotype A) and of lumpy skin disease that affected Egypt in 2006 were both linked to the importation of animals from Ethiopia [40] . Increase of importations of cattle and camels into Egypt may be explained by the growing demand of meat.

Those movements within Egypt would contribute the spread of RVFV in the event of introduction of the virus, as evidenced in other countries [43, 44] . The EVS characterized the network of animal markets by collecting information on the location, but also on several characteristics of 273 animal markets distributed throughout Egypt. That combined with the slaughterhouse data allows having a basic picture of the animal movement patterns within the country, which offers an alternative approach in countries without the resources to have a comprehensive recording of animal movements. That information is very useful for planning risk-based surveillance strategies (i.e. target those markets where detection of a particular disease is more likely), with the advantage the criteria may be adapted to each specific disease. The collection of more comprehensive information on for example the number of animals by species or the origins and destinations of the animals that went across those markets, would allow a much clearer picture of the animal movement network, and is therefore recommended The animal market network in Egypt is mainly composed of small markets, which basically operate once a week. Interestingly, almost 40% of the markets traded animals from different governorates, which means that infectious diseases are likely to spread efficiently once introduced into the country. In relation to the species, 2% of markets traded exclusively camels, and a 17% further traded camels plus other species susceptible to RVFV. Most of the markets are located in the areas beside the Nile river and its delta, but there are also animal markets alongside the Mediterranean coast, or even in the Sahara desert (Farafra market). Of the 273 markets, only 17 were in the governorates bordering Sudan, where smuggling of small ruminants was considered more likely. The risk-ranking score for markets varied between 5 and 15, with a mean value of 7.9. The markets with the highest risk of RVFV transmission were in the proximities or within the main cities (e.g. Cairo, Minya or Aswan), while most of the camel slaughterhouses were near Cairo. That proximity to urban areas results in an increased risk of RVFV transmission to humans (zoonotic risk). In contrast to camels, all cattle imported into Egypt are slaughtered within the quarantines to which they arrive, which are located in remote areas, far from populated areas.",

The inactivated vaccines against RVFV require a booster 3-6 months after initial vaccination, followed by yearly boosters [45] . Besides, the efficacy of the inactivated vaccine has not been tested in camels [45] , and further research on that field would be needed. While it has been argued that the long distance that the camels from Sudan need to walk to reach the Egyptian border would be enough to prevent the importation of infected animals, there are still many uncertainties in relation to RVFV infection in camels, and in any case, that measure does not comply with OIE rules for importation of live animals [6] .

Besides, about 10% of the camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia in the last 5 years were tested against RVF by RT-PCR, and were negative (MALRE personal communication). However, the sensitivity of such non-statistically based testing protocol for detecting the infection, if present, is questionable. While the measures currently implemented in camels are likely to reduce some of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt, their effect is likely to be limited. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the strategies implemented in cattle with the particularities that all cattle are slaughtered within the quarantine premises, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was estimated to be very low. Therefore, vaccination of imported cattle is unlikely to have a significant effect on the reduction of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt.",

However, the analysis of the vaccination data evidences a great heterogeneity in the level of vaccine coverage among species and governorates. Despite the increase in the number of vaccine doses administered in 2015 as compared to 2014, the level of vaccine coverage (30% in sheep and goats, 35% in buffaloes and 60% in cattle) would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country, in particular in those governorates where the level of vaccination is below average. Differences in the density of susceptible species throughout the country combined with the heterogenous application of vaccination programs among areas and species results in the identification of some areas of high density of susceptible hosts of RVFV, which is where efforts should be focused. Failures in the local application of vaccination programs were identified as one of the causes of previous epidemics of RVFV in Egypt [6] . There were also areas where high levels of vaccine coverage were reached resulting in a significant reduction of the risk of RVFV transmission. Conclusions in relation to vaccine coverages should be taken with caution, as the censuses used for their calculation may not be totally accurate/updated. Even though we used the distribution of Cx. pipiens to map vector distribution, we believe it is an accurate representation of the RVFV transmission by vectors. Entomological surveys indicate that Cx. pipiens is the most common mosquito species in Egypt [19, 47] and was considered the primary vector of RVFV in previous epidemics [5, 16] . Besides, the primary breeding areas of other RVFV vectors (e.g. Cx. antennatus) coincide with those of Cx. pipiens [16] .",

Model results may be influenced by the accuracy of some model inputs (e.g. vaccine coverage), or the uncertainty about some model parameters (e.g. susceptibility of the different species).

On the other hand, RVFV transmission within those quarantines may also occur by direct contact with tissues, body fluids or fomites of infected animals.",

            "text": "While all cattle are slaughtered within quarantine facilities, imported camels (potentially infected) may be taken to animal markets or to slaughterhouses after the quarantine period, and those would be the places where RVFV transmission would be more likely. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors at the 273 animal markets was rather variable (between 0 and 0.84), but the mean risk was quite high, 0.60. In the case of the 18 camel slaughterhouses, the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was quite high (mean risk of 0.59-0.60), and there was in fact less variability than in the case of animal markets. Establishment of an effective surveillance system in the areas surrounding key markets and camel slaughterhouses may allow the early detection of RVF and the timely establishment of control measures. That may include improving passive surveillance by raising farmers' awareness for the reporting of any symptom compatible with RVF and providing the mechanisms that allowed a prompt laboratory confirmation of any suspected case. Also, the establishment of some active (sentinel) surveillance in the locations identified as having the highest risk would be essential. Besides the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors, the slaughtering of animals, which in the case of cattle is carried out within quarantine premises, poses an important risk for humans by exposure to body fluids or tissues of infected animals. Infectivity of blood during the acute phase of infection in mammals is high [2] . Moreover, given that RVFV is quite resistant to inactivation, infected tissues may remain infectious for a period of a few days [2] . In fact, Nicholas and collaborators [48] concluded that practices such as skinning or slaughtering animals were significantly associated with the risk of RVFV infection. A cross-sectional survey on 1181 abattoir workers in 15 governorates of Egypt after the 1993 RVFV epidemic evidenced a 2% prevalence of anti-RVF IgM antibodies [49] . Antibodies were found in 9 of 31 slaughterhouses and 8 of 15 governorates, including several areas where no clinical disease had been reported. Therefore, Egyptian abattoirs in which imported cattle or camels are slaughtered should implement measures (e.g. use of personal protective equipment) to prevent the infection of the personnel.",

Illegal trade of animals through the borders is likely to occur, but its relevance in relation to the risk of RVFV introduction is difficult to assess, and would require further studies. On the other hand, the possibility of RVFV spread (potentially to distant areas) through the movement of infected (viraemic) humans and subsequent infection of competent vectors remains controversial. While for some authors humans infected by RVFV may develop a viremia sufficient to infect na\u00efve mosquitoes [50] , others consider humans as dead-end hosts [3] . Also, wind-borne transportation of infected mosquitos has been proposed [5] , but not demonstrated scientifically.",
