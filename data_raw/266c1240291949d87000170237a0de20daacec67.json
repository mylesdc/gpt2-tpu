Next generation sequencing was used to generate >90% RSV full-length genomes for 51.1% of positive samples (191/374). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed during household infection outbreaks ranged from 0-21 (median: 3) while SNPs observed during single-host infection episodes ranged from 0-17 (median: 1). Using the viral genomic data alone there was insufficient resolution to fully reconstruct withinhousehold transmission chains. For households with clear index cases, the most likely source of infant infection was via a toddler (aged 1 to <3 years-old) or school-aged (aged 6 to <12 years-old) cooccupant. However, for best resolution of WAIFW within households, we suggest an integrated analysis of RSV genomic and epidemiological data.",

As a result, alternative approaches are being considered including boosting infant antibody levels through maternal sub-unit vaccine immunization, pre-season delivery of high titre extended half-life immunoglobulin, reducing virus circulation in the community by vaccination of older babies and children or by cocoon vaccination to interrupt chains of transmission leading to infant infection 4, 17, 18 .

However, our initial analysis of RSVA full genome sequences (~15,200 nt) showed significant promise in providing phylogenetic resolution of viruses circulating in different households 10 and similar application of these methods have been shown for norovirus 22 , foot and mouth disease virus 23 , influenza A virus 24 , MERS-CoV 25 , and Ebola virus 26, 27 .

            "text": "Study location, design and samples. The study was undertaken within Kilifi County, which is located in coastal Kenya. A detailed description of the study location and study design was provided elsewhere 28 . Briefly, 47 households scattered across an area of approximately 21 km 2 were followed up over a 6-month period beginning December 2009 and ending June 2010 coinciding with the RSV peak activity months in the area 29 . Households were defined as a group of people sharing a compound and eating from the same kitchen 20 . The selected households (abbreviated HHs) were given designated identifiers from 1 to 57 (HH01 to HH57). Twice weekly throughout the study period, a nasopharyngeal-flocked swab (NPS) was obtained from each member regardless of symptom status. The NPS samples were screened for RSV using a multiplex real-time RT-PCR method which subtyped RSV positives into RSVA and RSVB 30 . For whole genome sequencing (WGS), we targeted 20 select households that documented RSV infection of \u22652 members. A geographical map showing the distribution of the study households is provided in the Additional File: Fig. S1. RNA extraction, amplification and whole nucleotide sequencing. Viral RNAs from the positive samples of selected households were obtained using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and RSV whole genome amplification was achieved using a six-overlapping PCR fragments strategy (each ~2.5 kb) as previously described 21 . Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera DNA Library Prep kits and nucleotide sequencing performed using Illumina MiSeq platform multiplexing 15-20 samples per run to generate approximately 1 million paired-end reads (150 bp \u00d7 2) per sample 21 .

The short reads from the MiSeq instrument were de-multiplexed, quality checked (median read Phred score of \u226535) and trimmed using QUASR v6.08 31 . Reads passing quality checks were de novo assembled into longer contigs using the SPAdes v3.5.0 32 . RSV contigs were identified by matching to a database of RSV sequences using USEARCH program 33 , examined for completeness of the expected open reading frames (ORF) using Geneious v8.1.6 (https://www. geneious.com) and, where necessary, partial contigs were further combined to longer ones using Sequencher v5.0.1 34 . These were subsequently checked presence of intact ORFs, sorted by household, re-aligned and positions of nucleotide variation double-checked if these were supported by majority of the raw reads associated with that sample 10 . Multiple sequence alignments were prepared in MAFFT v7.220 35 . phylogenetic analysis. Sequence phylogenies were inferred using Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods in MEGA7 36 and RAxML v8.2.12 37 . The best-fitting models of nucleotide substitution for each alignment were in IQ-TREE v1.4.3 38 . Best tree search was performed by Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI). Branch support was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated in pairsnp 0.0.6 39 . The phylogenetic relatedness of the household RSVA and RSVB genomes was assessed at three levels; (i) in combination with global sequences deposited in GenBank (RSVA, n = 657 collected between 1977-2015 while RSVB, n = 416 collected between 1978-2016), (ii) among the households viruses alone and (iii) among viruses collected from same households only. The potential transmission networks within and between households for each group were inferred in PopART package v1.7.2 using median joining tree (MJT) method with an epsilon of zero 40 . Evolutionary analyses were determined in maximum-likelihood-based TreeTime program 41 ",

This was motivated by unsuccessful vaccines for early infants and that evaluation of other options (family cocooning, school age vaccination 20, 42 ) requires an improved understanding of WAIFW. Our earlier work, based on temporal case observations, clearly suggested that the older children (siblings or cousins aged <15 years), particularly those attending school, played an important role in introducing the virus into the household leading to infant infection, but was not able to resolve within household transmission chains 20 . We have subsequently formalised the epidemiological analysis of RSV transmission in the household using an individual-based statistical approach to quantify the risk of infection from a range of host, pathogen and environmental factors 7 . The present study takes an alternative perspective of the problem, by focusing on the temporal patterns of genomic sequence variation to elucidate who infects whom in the household. This work extends a smaller study based on genomes of RSVA from 9 households 10 , to the current study of genomes of RSVA and RSVB in 20 households.",

Overall, the sequenced RSVB viruses showed ~7 times greater genomic diversity compared to RSVA. It is likely that the observed difference reflects annual stochasticity in the number of introduced strains rather than an inherent biological difference although a few previous reports indicated existence of subtle differences between the two groups in transmissibility and local persistence 21, 45 . Despite the close genetic relatedness of RSVA viruses detected in the study, our analysis showed that the 9 infected households were invaded by up to 5 distinct RSVA \"epidemiological strains\" that diverged at least 6 months before their collection date. For RSVB we determined This household showed high genetic variation in general. Infant was the third secondary case in the household and virus was close to index case 5707 (a schoolaged member) and 5702 (a toddler member). Table 2 . Inferring who most likely infected the infant in the household. \u00a5 Infant refers to the persons that were <1 year-old during our RSV surveillance period; Definition of the age defined intervals are: toddler (ages 1 to <3 years); pre-schooler (ages 3 to <6 years); school-aged child (ages 6 to <12 years); adolescent (ages 12 to <18years); adults (aged >18 years); \u00a3 Infector refers to the person whom most likely infected the infant in the household; \u20ac Co-index cases refer to the two individual whom were found concurrently first to be RSV positive in a household. \u00df Equivocal refers to when two individuals had an equal probability of being the source of the infant infection by our analysis approach and that could not be resolved further. Note that by our diagnostics, the infant in HH18 did not get RSV infected during our surveillance period.",

Highly similar intra-household and intra-host genomic variation patterns were observed between the two groups. Due to the intense logistics involved in undertaking such a study, only 50 households from one administrative unit (14, 998 persons in 1,835 homesteads) within Kilifi County were recruited 20 . The genome sequencing work targeted 20 households where \u22652 members were found to be RSV infected. Despite these households occurring in a small geographical area (~20 km 2 ) it was surprising to see up to 12 epidemiological strains in circulation. Most of the sampled viruses clustered by household. Some households shared the infecting strain with other households, suggesting a shared infection source although direct transmission between these households was unlikely given the large fraction of non-sampled households. Four out of the 12 identified epidemiological strains occurred only in one household each. Notably, households in close physical proximity did not necessarily end up being infected with similar virus clades or subclades implying other unobserved epidemiological factors rather than physical proximity may be more important in determining WAIFW in this community 46 .",

Perplexingly, the study infants were the second most frequent index cases (32%) and were co-index in a further 14% of the household episodes 20 . It is possible that some of the infant co-index cases were the infectors of infants in the household, but our diagnostic method (nasopharyngeal swab combined with RT-PCR) failed to detect the virus in the preceding samples. This may occur perhaps due to limited virus replication in older individuals or our 3-4 days sampling interval may have been too wide to capture index cases before onward transmission. By our diagnostic method, a parent was the index case only in one household.",

These individuals may have been true prolonged shedders of the virus or were virus re-infected. If prolonged shedders, then it is perplexing that in some individuals, there was one or more negative sample(s) separating the positive samples. Alternately, these could be false negative assay results which may have arisen due to the sensitivity of our sampling or diagnostic method or that the virus was temporarily absent from the upper respiratory tract airway but was still present elsewhere in the individual's respiratory tract. Prolonged shedding of RSV of up to 2 months has been previously reported especially in immune-compromised populations 47, 48 . Alternatively, if these were indeed reinfections, then this observation calls for an interrogation of protective RSV immune responses and this has implications to the development of effective RSV vaccines 49, 50 .",

The pace of RSV substitutions was demonstrated to be insufficiently fast to enable the full inference of within household RSV transmission trees. Additionally, we have previously shown that patterns of sharing of minor variants does not add insight beyond the consensus sequence approach 43 . Since in close to half of the study households the infant participant was the infection index or co-index case, for future studies we recommend sampling protocols that also consider, in addition to households, other potential RSV transmission settings in the community e.g. child-care centres, post-natal clinics, schools, school transportation, sporting events etc. Contact data should be collected to reinforce the viral sequence data and epidemiological data to support robust inferences of transmission pairs 46 . The protocols for genomic sequencing also need to be optimised to obtain virus sequences even from samples with diminishing virus titres. Given the imperfections of analyses of epidemiological data or genomic data in isolation, there is a clear need to undertake the joint analysis of both sources of information using a probabilistic framework 7 , that will allow inference of events not directly observable with inevitably imperfect data.",
