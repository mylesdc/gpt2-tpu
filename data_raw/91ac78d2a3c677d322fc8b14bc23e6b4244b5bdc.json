            "text": "This study analyzed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against HIV-1 using three different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses (NSV) expressing HIV-1 Gag as vaccine vectors: rabies virus (RABV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8 + T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8 + T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8 + T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8 + T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.",

Despite increasing knowledge of HIV as a pathogen and the interaction with the immune system [2] , the conundrum is creating a vaccine against a pathogen for which no adult human has been reported to have completely cleared an infection [3, 4] . The consensus is that the search for the most effective vaccine is no easy feat partly because the correlates of complete protection are unclear. However, like other clinically significant infectious diseases such as smallpox [5] , the need for a vaccine against HIV is of utmost importance in the management of the global HIV epidemic.",

Unlike other pathogens, attenuated HIV as a vaccine has not been explored, because attempts to attenuate SIV did not prevent rhesus macaques from getting an AIDS related illness [7] . Resultingly, other modes of antigen delivery have been explored. Live attenuated viral vectors have been particularly successful in the delivery of foreign antigens to the host. Distinct from other modes of vaccines such as subunit vaccines or DNA-plasmids, attenuated live viral vectors are able to induce robust cellular and humoral responses, largely due to their ability to undergo several rounds of replication in vivo [8] . To date, a number of different viral vectors have been extensively characterized and studied. A significant vaccine trial using human adenovirus-5 failed to result in protection of high-risk individuals from HIV infection [9] . One of the major drawbacks of this system was thought to be the presence of pre-existing antibodies against the viral vector [10] , necessitating the characterization of viral vectors with potential for use in HIV vaccine development. The goal of the project presented here was to evaluate three well-characterized NSV vectors in heterologous and homologous prime/boost experiments. The study of multiple vectors in the same laboratory environment also allows for comparisons to be made between vectors while keeping other variables static.",

NSVs have an advantage as vaccine vectors because they replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore do not have the risk of genetic recombination with host cell DNA. Of the aforementioned viruses, RABV, VSV and NDV are wellestablished candidates for HIV vaccine development. Schnell et al. first established a reverse genetic system in 1994 that allowed the recovery of infectious RABV from cloned cDNA [11] . This system was used to obtain other recombinant NSV including VSV [12] and NDV [13] . The genomes of these viruses can be readily manipulated to express multiple foreign genes [14, 15] . Unlike adenovirus-5, most individuals have not been previously exposed to these viruses and are thus seronegative. This factor makes them rank highly as potential viral vaccine candidates. In addition, all these viruses have been extensively studied as potential HIV/SIV vaccine vectors and shown to induce potent immune responses [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Induction of an effective T cell response requires replication of the vectors to achieve adequate antigen expression levels in both the priming and boosting phases. As such heterologous vaccine regimens might facilitate sufficient replication of the vectors to enhance the resulting cellular immune response, since they avoid the problem of anti-vector immunity in the boosting phase that is typical of homologous prime/boost protocols. To analyze the benefits of a heterologous prime/boost approach, we immunized mice with RABV-Gag followed by a second immunization with RABV-IG-Gag (which expresses VSV-Indiana G instead of RABV G), VSV-Gag, or NDV-Gag (Figure 2A ). Of note, throughout this study NDV-Gag was always applied twice 6 days apart, because the initial NDV infection does not prevent a second immunization by vector-specific antibodies as observed for RABV and VSV [13] . Two additional groups of mice did not receive any boost or were given an equal volume of PBS as a control. Following the boost immunization, the percentage of HIV-1 Gag specific cells was measured by AMQMLKETI tetramer on activated CD62L lo CD8 + T cells ( Figure 2B ). Functional expression of cytokines by CD8 + T cells was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining ( Figure 2C-E) . As shown in Figure 2 , mice immunized with NDV-Gag had significantly higher induction of Gag-specific CD8 + cells compared to VSV-Gag (p,0.0001) and RABV-IG-Gag (p,0.01). Similarly, a higher percentage of activated CD8 + T cells from mice boosted with NDV-Gag expressed IFN-c (p,0.0001), TNF-a (p,0.05), or both IFN-c and TNF-a (p,0.001).",

Taken together, VSV-Gag effectively increased the CD8 + T cell response after NDV-Gag prime, whereas this increase was not seen at a similar level after the boost with the RABV-based vaccine vector.",

Therefore, mice primed with RABV-Gag followed by heterologous immunizations with the other vectors were challenged with VV-Gag as shown ( Figure 5A ). The percentage of HIV-1 Gag CD8 + T cells ( Figure 5B ), as well as the expression of IFN-c and TNF-a, was analyzed as above ( Figure 5C-E) . Of note, although NDV-Gag induced the most robust CD8 + T cell response when used to boost mice immunized with the other NSVs, mice that had been boosted with NDV-Gag had a lower recall response after VV-Gag challenge. Differences between NDV-Gag and VSV-Gag in IFN-c + cells were statistically significant (p,0.001). In the second series of challenge experiments, mice that were primed with VSV-Gag followed by booster immunization with the other NSVs were challenged with VV-Gag ( Figure 6 ). In general, challenge with VV-Gag resulted in strong responses in all groups compared to the PBS only group, which did not induce any HIV-1 Gag-specific cells. Subtle differences in percentage of IFN-c + (p,0.0001) and TNF-a + (p,0.05) cells were evident when comparing boosted group responses to those from animals that received VSV-Gag prime only.",

            "text": "RABV, VSV and NDV as vaccine vectors against HIV-1 Gag have been extensively studied [15] [16] [17] [18] . Their genomes are easy to manipulate for insertion of multiple genes without affecting replication [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, their pathogenicity and immu- nogenicity have extensively been studied in mice and NHP [13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 30, 31, 38, 40] , and appropriately attenuated vectors have been developed. In this study, we analyzed HIV-1 Gag CD8 + T cell responses using each combination of the NSV vectors. Heterologous combinations of the vectors were able to boost HIV-1 Gag CD8 + T cells compared to not boosted control animals (Figures 2, 3, 4) . As expected, homologous combinations were not as effective at improving the response due to pre-existing immunity to the vector for RABV and VSV. NDV-Gag induced significantly higher CD8 + target cell responses in mice primed with RABV-Gag ( Figure 2 ) and VSV-Gag ( Figure 3) ; however, we need to consider that, in the case of NDV-Gag, two boost immuniza-tions were applied. As in previous studies, RABV-IG-Gag was also able to boost responses to RABV-Gag, because it contains the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of the VSV-G Indiana strain [26] . On the other hand, VSV-Gag induced the higher CD8 + T cell response in mice primed with NDV-Gag. Together, these post-boost data imply that both NDV-Gag and VSV-Gag are good candidates for use as boost vaccines with any of the three NSVs analyzed in this study. One interesting result of this study was that NDV-Gag was able to efficiently boost Gag-specific CD8 + cells after RABV-Gag priming, but VSV-Gag failed to do so ( Figure 2B ). This finding might help to further elucidate the mechanism of secondary responses for HIV-1 vaccines, and we do suspect that differences in the pattern of cytokine induction pattern might be responsible for the observed effects [26] .",

            "text": "It is important to note that the codon-optimized Gag gene inserts were cloned into the VSV and NDV recombinant vectors. Studies with NDV expressing codon-optimized Gag have been published [49] . Optimized Gag expression did not alter NDV recovery, which grew to similar levels as NDV control vectors. Furthermore, increased Gag expression enhanced the CD8 + T cell response as determined by reduction in VV-Gag titers in challenge experiments. Similarly, higher levels of HIV-1 Gag were expressed by VSV with optimized HIV-1 Gag than by VSV with nonoptimized HIV-1 Gag (data not shown). RABV expressing codon optimized Gag on the other hand did not express higher levels of Gag in the cell lysate or supernatant. In fact, the expression levels of Gag and RABV-N were lower when using codon-optimized Gag compared to the wild-type vector. One possible explanation is that codon optimization leads to differences in viral replication and transcription in the case of RABV. However, Gag expression levels cannot explain the robust post boost responses by VSV-Gag and NDV-Gag ( Figure 1B and C) , because NDV did express the The challenge studies in the mice were done using VV-Gag as previously published [50, 51] . VV-Gag is a virus that replicates and induces robust responses against foreign antigens like HIV-1 Gag in mice. The results from the challenge experiment showed that all prime-boost regimens generated significant recall responses compared to na\u00efve controls ( Figures 5, 6, 7) . Post VV-Gag challenge, mice that had been boosted with NDV-Gag had a lower CD8 + T cell response as compared to RABV-Gag and VSV-Gag boosted mice. This is not what we would have expected based on the robust responses induced by NDV-Gag boost data (Figure 2 -3). One difference between the boost and challenge studies was the immunization schedule: 35 days between prime and boost compared to 33 days between prime and challenge. However, previous studies have shown good challenge responses at 3 weeks post boost with NDV-Gag [18] . This could potentially be due to differences in long-term memory CD8 + T cells. The functional profile of the cells induced in the immune responses was determined by analyzing expression of IFN-c and TNF-a. Other cytokines analyzed included IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10. However, the levels of expression of these latter cytokines compared to background were too low and therefore not included (data not shown). In general, expression and co-expression of IFNc and TNF-a was proportional to the magnitude of the immune response induced post boost (Figure 2, 3, 4) and post challenge ( Figure 5, 6, 7 and Figure S1 ).",
