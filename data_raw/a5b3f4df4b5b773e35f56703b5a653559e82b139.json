Here we develop methods that estimate individual reproduction numbers and their variation through time and space. Individual reproduction numbers, R c , describe the state of transmission at a point in time and differ from mean reproduction numbers, which are averages of the number of people infected by a typical case. We assess elimination progress in El Salvador using data for confirmed cases of malaria from 2010 to 2016. Our results demonstrate that whilst the average number of secondary malaria cases was below one (0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.65), individual reproduction numbers often exceeded one. We estimate a decline in R c between 2010 and 2016. However we also show that if importation is maintained at the same rate, the country may not achieve malaria elimination by 2020.",

This information is necessary to effectively target resources to remaining 'hotspots' and 'hotpops' 5 where transmission remains, decide if and when it is appropriate to scale back interventions, and to evaluate the success of existing interventions. However, as countries approach zero cases, increasing focality in transmission and the impact of imported cases pose challenges to both reaching elimination 6 and measuring progress towards that goal. Increased spatial and temporal heterogeneity in malaria cases [7] [8] [9] in low transmission settings reduces the usefulness of national or regional level trends in incidence or prevalence, which can mask small areas of high transmission intensity. Furthermore, end-game surveillance and control measures are increasingly expensive per case. Therefore, while interventions must be targeted efficiently to be costeffective 7, 8, 10 , the identity of areas driving remaining transmission and their stability over time are poorly understood.",

Importation of malaria cases from neighbouring countries poses an additional challenge in many elimination settings. If many cases of malaria are imported, control measures may appear less effective due to small numbers of locally acquired cases arising from imported cases 16, 17 . If there is sufficient importation, local cases can continue to occur even when the reproduction number of malaria under control, R c , is below 1. Conversely areas with a high underlying R c but little importation may see sudden outbreaks of cases following a rare importation event due to their receptivity to malaria infection 18 . Challenges arise in measuring the sustainability of elimination 6, 17 , both in terms of quantifying the impact of control measures on transmission in the lead up to elimination, and in determining the risk of resurgence once elimination is achieved [19] [20] [21] . This information is also important when deciding if, when, and how to scale back intervention and surveillance methods 19 .",

The entomological inoculation rate (EIR), often seen as the 'gold standard' in measures of transmission intensity, is not reliable when transmission is highly focal and potentially unstable since EIR is very sensitive to heterogeneities in vector populations 24, 25 . Use of serological data, while promising [26] [27] [28] , is not currently feasible for use in many near-elimination contexts, as suitable cross-sectional survey data and/or appropriate markers to determine changes in malaria transmission are not available in all contexts.",

However, by 1995, the country contributed just 2%, maintaining low incidence until the present day. The country is now in the elimination phase and saw seven malaria cases in 2015 (0.1% of cases in Mesoamerica) 38 . Epidemiologists in El Salvador have kept records at a high spatial and temporal resolution throughout their malaria control and elimination efforts. In addition there has been a long history of reactive and active case detection, testing and treating all patients with fever with antimalarials and an extensive network of community malaria workers has been in place since the 1950s 38 , evidence suggesting that case detection and treatment is strong. A full understanding of elimination in El Salvador could therefore provide useful insights for other countries as they aim to achieve and sustain elimination. Using the epidemiological line-list maintained by the Ministry of Health, we applied our methods to these data to estimate how transmission varied over space and time in El Salvador between 2010 and 2016.",

Our results suggest that the time-averaged R c has been below 1 in El Salvador since 2010, suggesting that sustained endemic transmission at the country level has already been interrupted. However, we estimated individual reproduction numbers exceeding one, resulting in ongoing outbreaks of transmission. Assuming the downward trend observed in R c between 2010 and 2016 continues, we expect the probability of such outbreaks to be <5% by 2023 if current levels of malaria importation and control continue. However, because we found imported cases to have higher reproduction numbers and their inclusion in the transmission tree increased the overall likelihood of the tree much more than locally acquired cases, it is important to note that the rate of importation is likely to affect the distribution of R c . With increased importation this timeline to elimination could lengthen. Conversely, if importation was reduced, the timeline would be shortened. Thus the levels of malaria importation from neighbouring countries would likely need to be decreased in order to achieve elimination by 2020, following current WHO certification policy of three years of zero locally acquired cases.",

These could be sources of the missing infections identified in our study. However, El Salvador is unlikely to have a large amount of asymptomatic cases due to a long history of low numbers of cases. If our missing source of infections was mainly indigenous asymptomatic infections, it would signify that there is an asymptomatic reservoir contributing to onward transmission and that must be controlled to reach elimination. This could be achieved through PCR-based screening and treatment or increased vector control in focal areas. An alternative explanation is that there may be a small number of unreported symptomatic cases or relapse cases which were not reported or detected, which could be indigenous or imported. If due to importation this would further support the need for strong regional cooperation via initiatives such as EMMIE to reduce burden in neighbouring countries, and to maintain vigilance over extended periods in a near-elimination stage.",

In these contexts the number of cases is likely to be higher and there may be less complete reporting data and potentially a higher reservoir of asymptomatic infection. In order to address these challenges several adaptations to the methods presented here may be required. First, there may be a need to incorporate more sources of information, e.g., demographic, spatial and possibly genetic data 30, 37 . Second, Bayesian data augmentation techniques 43 may be required to explore the implications of large amounts of missing infection and potential reporting biases. In the case of more asymptomatic or untreated malaria there may be more uncertainty in the serial interval of malaria, however using our current approach can propagate this uncertainty through the model. Generalisations to full likelihood based or Bayesian hierarchical inference 36 can be beneficial by providing flexibility through parametric forms by allowing for the incorporation of additional factors (e.g., genetic distance) specific to the disease and context. This work provides a novel framework for making use of routine surveillance data, and allows quantification of malaria transmission and its variation over space and time in contexts where traditional methods such as parasite prevalence are unsuitable. This is key in designing optimal strategies to accelerate, achieve and maintain elimination. To apply to other contexts several adaptations and extensions may be required. Firstly, in this dataset there were no confirmed relapse cases, however in many contexts we may see P. vivax relapse, in which case the algorithm could be adapted to allow for a likelihood for 'reinfection' or a looped network edge. Second, in settings where transmission links are less clearly identifiable or different data sources are available, this approach can be adapted to incorporate additional features such as spatial or genetic distance weightings into the likelihood function 37 , following on from work based on Wallinga and Teunis approaches 30, 43, 44 . Finally, asymptomatic reservoirs and causes of missing cases, as well as their impact on transmission dynamics could be explored in more detail to consider surveillance system design and evaluation of its strength.",

Such approaches offer opportunities to better understand transmission dynamics and their heterogeneities in near elimination settings to better target interventions for elimination. We estimated timescales for reaching elimination and clarified the effect of importation on the speed and feasibility of achieving and maintaining zero cases. In the context of El Salvador, our results highlight the impact of importation on sustained transmission and highlight the need for cross-border collaboration. Our approach could be useful in a wide range of contexts where good quality routine surveillance data are collected, such as outbreaks and endemic diseases nearing elimination.",

The line-list featured a unique patient identifier, address, age, sex, symptom onset date, and treatment seeking date, as well as details about treatment and diagnostic testing.

Detailed case investigation was carried out by MINSAL and cases were identified as imported or locally-acquired based on travel history, as well as primary, secondary, tertiary or orphan cases without clear sources, based on relationship with and proximity to previous cases. We obtained the latitude and longitude of the address, accurate to caser\u00edo (hamlet) level, using Open Street Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org/). El Salvador carries out reactive case detection following presentation at health facilities. However, in 2011, of 4500 slides examined through reactive case detection (representing 4.5% of all slides examined), just one additional case was detected. Both passive and active screening of migrants at key border crossings and in agricultural areas near borders also takes place. In these targeted areas, individuals are monitored for fever in the past 30 days, tested, and a single dose of chloro-primaquine prophylaxis is provided. In 2011, the Ministry of Health reported that 33,000 migrants were reached through active and passive case detection and an additional four cases of malaria were found 45 . Most cases were detected through passive surveillance in health facilities, at borders and by community health workers in rural areas.",

Two cases imported from West Africa were P. falciparum, however the remainder of cases were P. vivax. As a result the prior distribution was altered to better reflect the biology of P. vivax and the dominant vector species in El Salvador, Anopheles albimanus, but was uninformative enough to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics, for example due to imported infections with P. falciparum. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of asymptomatic or undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing transmission, which will take on a longer serial interval.

Our exposition until this point is the same as that introduced by Wallinga and Teunis 29 and extended to a wide variety of contexts by others [30] [31] [32] 43, 44, 50 . However, in contrast to previous methods based on Wallinga and Teunis we maximise the likelihood f \u00f0tjG\u00de conditional on an underlying G, a problem that is NP-hard 51 . Previous approaches have either allowed all possible connections in G 29 , sampled from the likelihood 52 or explored a limited number of pathways 53 . Here, by following the approach introduced by Rodriguez and Sch\u00f6lkopf 35 , we find the most likely underlying transmission network given the timing of symptom onset for a set of k transmission events linking cases. The computational hardness of maximising f \u00f0tjG\u00de meant that an optimal solution could only be found by exploring every possible transmission tree on G. However, due to the submodularity of the independent cascade model 33 a near optimal solution could be found using a greedy algorithm. Briefly, the greedy algorithm used starts with an empty graph, and then add edges sequentially such that the marginal gain in the likelihood of the transmission tree for each iteration is maximised. The marginal gain measures of importance for each edge of the network through the gain that each edge provides to the total solution over competing edges, and therefore applies shrinkage to the raw pairwise likelihood with the likelihood of competing edges. We stop when we have reached k edges (see Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Stopping at k edges ensures that the resulting network is sparse which not only ensures a parsimony but removes unnecessary edges that could influence R c calculations. An appropriate value of k is defined by adding edges until the marginal gain in likelihood of adding additional edges is below a given threshold (0.0005). We carried out a sensitivity analysis and find our results are robust to changes in this threshold between 0.001 and 1e\u221210 (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 3) .",

Symptomatic cases may be missed by not seeking care or being found through active case detection, and or cases may be asymptomatic and therefore unlikely to seek care or be detected. The latter may have densities of parasites in their blood which are too low to be detectable by microscopy if active case detection occurs. These processes apply to both imported cases or locally acquired cases. We assume the pool of asymptomatic cases in the country is low and has a small contribution to ongoing transmission. To estimate the proportion of cases which may be going undetected within our independent cascade framework, we consider outside sources of infection, \u03c0 that represent unobserved individuals who can infect any observed individual, i, in a transmission chain. Every observed individual i can get infected by unobserved individuals, \u03c0, with an arbitrarily small probability \u03b5. This so called \u03f5-edge is connected to every node in our network and do not, by design, participate in the diffusion propagation. The \u03f5-edges prevents breaks in the network diffusion cascade where the likelihood of transmission between observed cases is sufficiently low, and instead the case is linked to an external source. The specific value of \u03b5 was set at 0.0005, aiming to find a balance between false positives and false negatives when linking cases by infection events. The higher the value of \u03b5, the larger the number of nodes that are assumed to be infected by an external source.",

Thin blue lines represent 300 realisations of the SI distribution resulting from draws from the distributions of the parameters determining the shape of the SI and incubation period. The serial interval distribution is the distribution of the time between the onset of symptoms (fever) in a case and the onset of symptoms in the case(s) it infects. The thicker blue line represents the expected SI distribution. For comparison, the grey line represents the SI distribution estimated for symptomatic, treated P. falciparum infection from 47 and the black line shows the expected SI for P. falciparum from 17 . b Heatmap showing likelihood of transmission occurring between infector and infectee pairs. The X axis represents all possible infectors (all reported cases) of the observed cases, organised by symptom onset date. The Y axis represents all possible infectees (all locally acquired cases, as by definition we assume imported cases were infected outside of the country). Each square represents a potential infector/infectee pair. The colours of the heatmap represent the normalised likelihood of infector j having been the infector of infectee i. where red is 1 and grey is 0. Grey squares show where cases were not likely to be infected by to any observed case, and therefore presumably infected by an individual who was not detected by surveillance. These could be asymptomatic or unreported clinical cases. c Reconstructed network, where numbers represent the ID of cases in temporal order.
