            "text": "Bats are associated with several important zoonotic viruses from different families. One example includes adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), that are extensively detected in several animals, especially primates. To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.",

AAVs are a group of small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses without envelopes that belong to the parvovirus family. The entire genome of AAV is approximately 4.7 kb and contains two major ORFs that encode for Rep and Cap proteins. Under normal circumstances, the AAV virus can coexist within the mammalian host for an extended period without apparent pathogenicity. However, productive infection only occurs in the presence of a helper virus, either adenovirus or herpesvirus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Due to this, AAV has become an important gene therapy vector for its non-pathogenic and conditional infectious life cycle 8 .",

To date, thirteen AAV serotypes (designated AAV1-AAV13) and more than 100 unique variants have been isolated and identified from primate and non-primate hosts [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Hosts can be as diverse as Chiropteras, Porcine, Serpentes, Bovines, Caprines and Chickens. Among these natural hosts, bats are more geographically dispersed. In addition, Bats host a greater number of emerging viruses per species compared to any other mammalian clade 26, 27 . Bats have been increasingly recognized as a natural host for AAVs in recent years, in addition to the many other important zoonotic viruses, such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus [28] [29] [30] [31] . With the development of molecular and sequencing technologies, numerous novel AAVs are being discovered. These include BtAAV-YNM 14 , Rp-BtAAV1 and Rs-BtAAV1 32 . Yan Li identified several adenoviruses and AAVs in a wide host range of bat species with remarkable genetic diversity 14 . Lau SKP investigated the presence of parvoviruses among different bat species in Hong Kong and mainland China 32 . Their work broadened the current knowledge of AAV diversity in Bats. Several studies also have investigated the origins of viral diversity in bats or the maintenance of bat-associated viruses in nature. In addition, considerable emphasis has been placed on understanding the direct epidemiological interface from bats to humans [33] [34] [35] .",

The average prevalence rate is as high as 18.6%, which suggests that AAVs are considerably prevalent among various bat species. However, the absence of Myotis formosus AAV in this study may be due to the limited sampling size. Partial rep and cap ORF sequences analysis of the detectable bat AAVs revealed a relatively large genetic diversity among the bat samples. This suggests that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations as previous studies have reported 14, 32 . However, further extensive work has to be The phylogenetic study of BtAAV-CXC1 with 26 other AAVs suggested that it was a novel AAV member of the genus Dependovirus. It was phylogenetically closer to mammalian AAVs compared to avian, waterfowl or snake AAVs. BtAAV-CXC1 shared a large branch with the previously reported Rp-BtAAV1, BtAAV1-YNM, and other known human or non-human primates AAVs. This included Adeno-associated virus A, Adeno-associated virus B, and all proven human AAVs (Fig. 3) . Amino acid sequence analysis of the rep gene of this novel BtAAV-CXC1 showed 64.8% similarity with human AAV2. Similar results were obtained in a previous study 32 . In addition, several previous studies have indicated that mammalian and non-mammalian AAVs had a separate evolutionary path, except for a few avian, waterfowl and reptilian AAVs that were distantly related to mammalian AAVs. Bats are thought to be the original host for alpha coronaviruses and beta coronaviruses, while birds for gamma coronaviruses and delta coronaviruses 32, 37, 38 . The discovery of additional AAVs from bats and other mammals will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary origin and pathways of mammalian AAVs. Our study found that the co-occurrence of bat adenovirus and AAV in bat samples was as high as 33.7%, which was similar to the findings in Li et.al. 's study 14 . This may be because other viruses such as herpesvirus and vaccinia virus are essential for the replication of AAV 39 .",
