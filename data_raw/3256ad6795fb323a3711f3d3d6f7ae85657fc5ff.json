In this study, we further showed that 2H6 binds stronger to the NS1 of H5N1 than A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48. A crystal structure of 2H6 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has also been solved and docked onto the NS1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody-antigen complex. In one of the models, the predicted molecular contacts between residues in NS1 and 2H6-Fab correlate well with biochemical results. Taken together, residues N48 and T49 in H5N1 NS1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mAb 2H6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody. Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-2009 and the majority of seasonal H3N2 circulating in humans since 1968 has N48 in NS1, suggesting that mAb 2H6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains. Consistent with the involvement of residue T49, which is well-conserved, in RNA binding, mAb 2H6 was also found to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and double-stranded RNA.",

The conventional influenza vaccine aims to stimulate immunity to produce antibodies against the viral envelope HA protein. Unfortunately, these antibodies are mainly strain specific, in which case IAV might be able to evade the recognition of the antibody by constantly mutating the antigenic determinants 7 . Thus, one way to overcome this limitation is to produce and/or engineer antibodies that could neutralize most viral strains. Alternatively, another option to combat IAV is the use of antiviral compounds, which include two classes of drugs. One is directed against M2 ion channel protein to block the uncoating of virus after its entry into the host cells 8 and another is against NA to block the release of 1 newly formed virions to surrounding uninfected cells 9 . As resistance to these two classes of antiviral drugs has occurred in the circulating strains of the IAVs 10 , there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches.",

By binding to and sequestering dsRNA from 2\u2032 -5\u2032 oligo (A) synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway, NS1 protects IAV against the antiviral state induced by IFN-\u03b2 17 . NS1 could also inhibit ubiquitin ligase activity of Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) to modulate retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) induced IFN response 18 . Recently, the direct interaction between RIG-I and NS1 with strain specificity has been reported 19 , which provided the structural basis for how this interaction might modulate virulence during the infection. Besides, direct binding of NS1 to protein kinase R (PKR) could help IAVs counteract PKR-mediated anti-viral response 20 . NS1 has also been shown to interact directly with the p85\u03b2 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) but it is unclear how this interaction contributes to apoptosis regulation in infected cells 21, 22 .",

To further define the contribution of residue 48 in H5N1-NS1 to the interaction with mAb 2H6, two mutant proteins in which N was mutated to A and S respectively, were generated. Comparative ELISA showed that mAb 2H6 bound to NS1(RBD)-wild-type (WT) stronger than NS1(RBD)-N48S when different amounts of protein were coated on the plate and analyzed with 5 \u03bc g/ml of mAb 2H6 ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, when a fixed amount of protein (125 \u03bc g/ml) was coated on the plate and analyzed with different concentrations of mAb 2H6, the binding to NS1(RBD)-N48S was significantly lower than NS1(RBD)-WT (Fig. 2B ). Furthermore, when N was substituted with A at residue 48, the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1(RBD) was totally abolished in all the conditions tested ( Fig. 2A,B) . This result suggests that the difference at residue 48 is the main reason for the stronger binding of mAb 2H6 to H5N1-NS1(RBD) when compared to H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) (Fig. 1 ). Since both N48 and S48 are polar amino acids while A48 has no side chain, it is probable that the formation of hydrogen bonds is important for the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1.",

Thus, recombinant PR8 (rgPR8) viruses expressing the NS1 protein containing a single amino acid substitution at residue 48 (rgPR8-NS1-S48A and rgPR8-NS1-S48N) were generated using a reverse genetics system.

Since the three dimensional structure of 2H6-Fab has been solved, a commercially available Lipodin-Ab reagent (Abbiotec), which is a protein transfection reagent dedicated to the transport of antibodies into living cells, was used to deliver 2H6-Fab into A549 cells. The cells were then subjected to infection so as to determine if 2H6-Fab has an impact on viral replication. When either 2H6-Fab or 1A9-Fab (which is derived from a negative-control antibody binding to the spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus) 31 was transfected into A549 cells using Lipodin-Ab reagent, intracellular accumulation of Fab was observed even up to 24 h post transfection (Fig. 4A) . The intracellular accumulation of Fab was also observed at as early as 4 h post transfection (data not shown). The transfection efficiency was about 70% and most of the Fab molecules were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm but there were some punctate staining which could be due to aggregation of Fab inside A549 cells. In contrast, no intracellular accumulation of Fab was observed when 1A9-Fab or 2H6-Fab was added to the cells without Lipodin-Ab reagent. As shown in Fig. 4B , the delivery of Fab did not have any significant effect on cell viability at either 12 or 24 h post transfection.",

As additional ELISA results showed that 3 residues, namely S42, R44, and G47, in NS1 are not involved in interaction with mAb 2H6 ( Figure S1 ), this information was used to distinguish between the models in these 3 clusters. Of all energetically best models generated, 9 predicted models were grouped into cluster 2. The average buried surface area was 1670.7 \u00b1 52.6 \u00c5 2 , and RMSD from the overall lowest-energy structure was 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5. Among them, the best predicted model from this cluster showed good agreement with our comparative ELISA data, since only residues N48 and T49 were predicted to be involved in the interaction, while the side chains of S42, R44 and G47 were either distal from the interface (S42 and R44) or inaccessible (G47) to the binding partner of 2H6-Fab (Fig. 5) . By analyzing the polarity of the amino acids and distance between them in this model, it is predicted that residues N52 and N54 in the variable domain of heavy chain (VH)-complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2) of 2H6-Fab could form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of N48 in NS1(RBD). In addition, the side chain of T49 in NS1(RBD) could form hydrogen bonds with residue R57 in VH-CDR2. In contrast, VH-CDR1, VH-CDR3 and all the CDRs in the variable domain of light chain (VL) are unlikely to be involved in the interaction as they are distal to helix \u03b1 2 of NS1(RBD).",

The key residues in NS1 involved in the interaction with dsRNA are T5, D29, D34, R35, R37, R38, L41, S42 and T49, most of which are positively charged residues and mainly clustered in the middle of helices \u03b1 2/\u03b1 2\u2032 of the RBD 33, 34 . To investigate whether mAb 2H6 hampers dsRNA-NS1 interaction in vitro, an AlphaScreen assay was carried out. In this experiment, glutathione S-transferease (GST)-tagged H5N1-NS1(RBD) protein, which was produced in E. coli, was incubated with synthetic 21-nucleotide siRNA (21nt-siRNA) followed by addition of streptavidin coated donor beads and anti-GST-conjugated acceptor beads which recognize biotinylated RNA and GST-tagged protein respectively. If the interaction between NS1 and 21nt-siRNA brings both beads to close proximity, transfer of excitation energy from donor beads into acceptor beads will yield a luminescent signal (Fig. 6A ) 35 . When NS1(RBD) was pre-incubated with different concentrations of mAb 2H6 followed by addition of 21nt-siRNA, acceptor and donor beads, the luminescent signal decreased at high concentration of mAb 2H6 (Fig. 6B ). The luminescent signal was reduced by ~30% and ~70% at mAb 2H6 concentrations of 1 and 5 \u03bc M respectively (Fig. 6B) , suggesting that the binding of mAb 2H6 to NS1(RBD) can block the interaction of NS1 with dsRNA. On the other hand, the negative control mAb 1A9 did not reduce the luminescent signal at all the concentrations tested. Furthermore, when mAb 2H6, NS1 and 21nt-siRNA were mixed simultaneously, 5 \u03bc M of mAb 2H6 could reduce the signal by about 30% (Fig. 6C) , which suggest that mAb 2H6 also directly competes with dsRNA to bind to NS1.",

The NS1(RBD) consists of the first 73 amino acids and contains residues critical for dsRNA binding 14 . The dimerization of the RBD is a prerequisite for its RNA binding activity 13 . Since the NS1 protein is an intracellularly expressed viral protein, which is subjected to less host selective immune response and thus has lower mutation rate, antibodies targeting this protein could be helpful for the development of therapeutic treatment of influenza A infection.

Interestingly, a recent computational study compared the viral proteins of highly and lowly pathogenic H5 viruses and identified S48 to N substitution as a potential marker of pathogenicity of avian influenza virus subtype H5 37 . As for human isolates, the majority (93%) of seasonal H1N1 isolated before 2009 have S48 in NS1 like H1N1-PR8. However, almost all the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pdmH1N1) isolates have N48 in NS1. As for seasonal H3N2, 91% of viruses isolated before 2009 have N48 and this percentage increased to 99% for those isolated from 2009 to 2015.

Based on one of the energetically best models generated, the side chain of residue N48 in NS1(RBD) could form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of residues N52 and N54 of VH-CDR2 of 2H6-Fab.

These predictions are consistent with the results of binding assays performed using substitution mutants of NS1 as described above and in our previous study 29 . While the predicted 3D model of the antibody-antigen complex gives us some clues on how residues 48 and 49 in NS1(RBD) interact with 2H6-Fab, it may be able to accurately reveal the contributions of all molecular contacts between NS1(RBD) and 2H6-Fab.

            "text": "Furthermore, an AlphaScreen assay showed that mAb 2H6 could inhibit the interaction between NS1 and dsRNA (Fig. 6) . While both residues 48 and 49 are located in helix \u03b1 2 of the NS1(RBD), it has been shown that T49, but not S48, is one of the key residues involved in dsRNA binding 34 . Thus, the interaction between T49 and 2H6-Fab predicted in the docked model is consistent with the ability of mAb 2H6 to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and dsRNA. Although a previous study has demonstrated that mutation at residue 48 did not affect the affinity of NS1(RBD) for dsRNA 30 , our study suggests that the side chain of N48 makes crucial contacts with mAb 2H6 to stabilize the antibody-antigen complex. As such, when the side chain is not present in the case of GST-tagged NS1 protein was incubated with biotinylated dsRNA and the interaction between NS1 and dsRNA could bring streptavidin-coated donor bead and anti-GST-conjugated acceptor bead close to each other. When excited at 680 nM, singlet oxygen molecules ( 1 O 2 ) are produced from donor beads, which react with acceptor beads to produce light emission measured at 520-620 nM. (B) Inhibition activity of mAb 2H6 was determined by pre-incubating 10 nM GST-tagged NS1 protein with serially diluted mAb 2H6 or a negative control mAb 1A9. Following that, luminescent signal was measured after the addition of 10 nM biotinylated dsRNA, acceptor and donor beads. (C) Inhibition activity of mAb 2H6 was determined by incubating 10 nM GST-tagged NS1 protein, 10 nM biotinylated-dsRNA and serially diluted mAb 2H6 or 1A9 simultaneously. Following that, luminescent signal was measured after the addition of acceptor and donor beads. All readings obtained were normalized against that of samples in the absence of antibody. Error bars represent SD of the experiment carried out in triplicates. *Indicates statistically significant difference of p < 0.05 when compared to mAb 1A9. the N48A substitution mutant, interaction with mAb 2H6 is completely abolished (Figs 2 and 3 ). This indicates that the interaction between the side chains of residue T49 in NS1 and residue R57 in 2H6-Fab is not sufficient to maintain the antibody-antigen interface. On the other hand, the T49V and T49A substitution mutants still retained some binding to mAb 2H6 ( Figure S1 ), presumably because of the hydrogen bonds between residue N48 and the heavy chain of the antibody. Based the AlphaScreen assay, a high concentration of mAb 2H6 (~5 \u03bc M) was required to reduce the interaction between NS1(RBD) and dsRNA by > 50% (Fig. 6) . On the other hand, the concentration of mAb 2H6 required for binding NS1(RBD) in ELISA was in the nanomolar range (Fig. 2) . This discrepancy could be due to the differences between the two assays but it also suggests that the binding of mAb 2H6 to NS1 could have other effects on NS1 besides disrupting its interaction with dsRNA. Indeed, our previous gel filtration and dynamic light scattering results suggest that the complex between 2H6-Fab and NS1(RBD) is multimeric in nature and each oligomer could consist of 6 molecules of NS1(RBD) and 6 molecules of 2H6-Fab 29 . In contrast, NS1(RBD) eluted out the gel filtration column as a dimer, as would be expected, in the absence of 2H6-Fab 29 . In addition, the delivery of 2H6-Fab into A549 cells also caused a reduction in the replication of rgPR8-NS1-S48N recombinant virus (Fig. 4) . While it is difficult to precisely define the biologically relevant quaternary structures of NS1, several studies have shown that the NS1 has conformational plasticity and dynamic changes in the quaternary structure of NS1 are likely to be important for the different functions of NS1 in infected cells 39 . Hence, it is possible that the binding of 2H6-Fab to the NS1 expressed in infected A549 cells could affect the conformational plasticity of NS1 and/or its ability to interact with certain cellular factor, thus resulting in a reduction in viral replication. In future studies, advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques could be used to determine the effect of 2H6-Fab on the dynamic of NS1 inside infected cells.",

After solving a high resolution crystal structure of 2H6-Fab, a HADDOCK-derived model of the antibody-antigen complex has been obtained and the molecular contacts predicted from this model are in agreement with results obtained from comparative ELISA performed using NS1 mutants. This model may be used in antibody engineering experiments to increase the affinity of interaction between NS1 and mAb 2H6 so as to increase mAb 2H6's potency in viral inhibition. In addition, it may be useful in structure-based rational drug design to identify small molecule inhibitors of NS1.",

A total of 360 frames of a native data set with 1 oscillation at 1.5418 \u00c5 wavelength were collected for 2H6-Fab. All data sets were processed by HKL2000. Most of the crystals diffracted rather weak and the scaled data sets were anisotropic with strong ice rings and high mosaicities. Nevertheless, one of the data sets displaying Scientific RepoRts | 6:33382 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33382 weak ice ring was able to scale to 2.4 \u00c5 at the mosaicity of 1.8\u00b0. This data was used for structure determination and refinement with the statistic table listed as Table 1 .",

As the three-dimensional structure of NS1(RBD) of A/chicken/Hatay/2004(H5N1) has not been solved, the structure of NS1(RBD) of A/crow/Kyoto/T1/2004(H5N1) (PDB ID: 2Z0A) was used instead. As shown in Fig. 1A , there are 3 amino acid differences between the NS1(RBD) of these two strains but the sequence of helix \u03b1 2 in the NS1(RBD) is 100% identical. Mutagenesis data from comparative ELISA was used to generate a series of models for the complex between 2H6-Fab and NS1(RBD) by using version 2.2 of HADDOCK webserver 32, 42 . Along with the available individual structure, HADDOCK utilizes the experimentally derived data to predict the complex structure. To achieve this, NS1(RBD) was docked to 2H6-Fab using the Easy Interface of HADDOCK webserver, where both residues N48 and T49 of NS1(RBD) and amino acids in the CDRs of 2H6-Fab were defined as active residues involved in the interaction. In this docking experiment, only the variable domains of 2H6-Fab were used.",
