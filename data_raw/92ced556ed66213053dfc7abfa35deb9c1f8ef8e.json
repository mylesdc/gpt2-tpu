A need for solidarity, resources and strong governance Tikki Pang I n the wake of recent outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and the MERS-CoV viruses, and with trust in global institutions at an alltime low, many are asking: how prepared is the global public health community to deal with future emerging pandemics? A recent report by the Commission on the Global Health Risk Framework, convened by the US National Academy of Medicine, stated that \"we are underinvested and underprepared\" (GHRF Commission, 2016) . What needs to be done? Our experience so far shows that collective action at national, regional and global levels, backed by strong political will and sufficient resources, is the best way to enhance pandemic preparedness and deal with what is not just a health, but a much wider global security issue.",

The Ebola crisis in West Africa demonstrated the dire consequences of fragile health systems unprepared to deal with a massive epidemic. National preparedness is based on the capacities for surveillance, rapid diagnosis, case management, a trained health workforce and surge capacity within the health infrastructure to deal with large numbers of affected persons. WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), which covers surveillance, monitoring, containment and core capacity building, serves as a guide for countries to strengthen their national health infrastructure and pandemic preparedness. Within a larger context, the strengthening of health systems through provision of universal health care is necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Touraine et al, 2014) , and pandemic preparedness must be seen as a part of the overall health infrastructure in a holistic and integrated manner.",

At a higher policy level, WHO continues to be the major international public health agency with a mandate to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which it has done three times in relation to pandemic influenza, the resurgence of polio and Ebola. Besides alerting the world to a potential pandemic, a PHEIC declaration raises global awareness, facilitates coordinated action and, importantly, helps to mobilize resources to mitigate the impacts of a pandemic. At the front lines, global responses by international NGO's such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the International Red Cross have also been critical in dealing with rapidly deteriorating situations, such as with Ebola in West Africa.",

The WHO is not an organization, which can, in 48-72 h, mobilize 100 doctors, 100 nurses and 100 tons of equipment and then transport them to crisis hotspots around the world. Despite the fact that one of its core functions is \"to provide technical support to Member States\", it is not an emergency response organization and it is not equipped to do so. What it can, and perhaps should have done, was to be a information clearing house to more rapidly alert the world of the impending emergency. The delay was partly attributed to WHO's organizational structure and delays in information flows between its regional offices and its headquarters in Geneva (Maurice, 2015) . MSF, on the other hand, responded heroically on the front lines but was soon overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the Ebola outbreak. WHO has borne the brunt of the criticisms, but questions have also been raised about the role of other entities during the Ebola crisis, including the World Bank, the governments of the affected countries, NGOs and other humanitarian groups, and the African Union. In addition, bilateral government responses from the militaries and agencies of the USA, the UK and France were instrumental in helping to deal with the Ebola crisis, but such responses have important diplomatic and political repercussions, which require more analysis and dialogue.",

Four are proposed: (i) reforming, consolidating and strengthening key WHO functions; (ii) providing significant and sustainable resources to rapidly responding to outbreaks: suggestions have been made, for example, for a contingency fund of US$100 million to be established at WHO and a much larger Pandemic Emergency Facility to be set up between WHO and the World Bank; (iii) highlevel political commitment and mechanisms to ensure rapid and coordinated global action, perhaps through the imprimatur of the UN Security Council which declared a resolution on Ebola (Gostin & Friedman, 2014) ; and (iv) the need for a more multi-sectoral approach. For instance, in lieu of the fact that many emerging diseases have animal origins, organizations involved in animal health should also participate, through a \"One Health\" approach, in joint monitoring and surveillance efforts (McCloskey et al, 2014) .",

While it may be attractive in the current atmosphere of disappointment with global institutions to propose a new \"Global Fund for Health\" (Ooms & Hammonds, 2014) , this decision should not be taken lightly. There are already many entities and the creation of new structures has huge implications with regard to the risk of fragmentation of efforts, governance, resources and political issues, which extend well beyond health. Prudence dictates that strengthening existing structures and mechanisms, based on the lessons learned from recent pandemics, would be a better strategy. To give the needed effort the necessary political boost, it has been suggested that a high-level summit meeting should be convened, ideally by a respected third party outside of the United Nations, which will allow all interested parties to objectively compare their diagnoses of what is needed, and suggest solutions for enhancing preparedness (Garrett, 2015) . Such an opportunity may occur in May 2016 during the G-7 Summit at Ise-Shima in Japan where outbreak preparedness is likely to be on the agenda as part of the broader theme of human security.",
