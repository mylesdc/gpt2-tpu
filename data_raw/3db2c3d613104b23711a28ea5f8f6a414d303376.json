This observational study was conducted over two-year period in a tertiary care teaching hospital of Eastern India. Nasal and throat swabs were collected, transported to the laboratory at 2-8 \u2218 C in viral transport media, and then processed for detection of viruses using mono/multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. A total of 300 children aged 2-60 months with ARIs were included. The most common age group affected with LRI was 2-12 mo and with URI was >12-60 mo. Viruses were detected in 248 cases. In URI, 77 were positive for single virus and 19 were positive for more than one virus; in LRI, 113 were positive for single virus and 12 were positive for more than one virus. The most common viruses isolated from URI cases were rhinovirus and adenovirus. The most common viruses isolated from LRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Most cases occurred in the months of January, December, and August. Conclusion. Viruses constitute a significant cause of ARI in children under five. RSV, ADV, RV, and IFV were the most prevalent viruses isolated.",

Though the pathogens causing ARIs vary geographically and by season, globally viruses play a major role [1] [2] [3] . In a recent systematic review, the most common respiratory viruses causing acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) in children under five years of age were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus (RV) [1] . Besides this, 10%-50% of children affected with ARI develop secondary bacterial infections, namely, acute otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia [4] . Moreover, viruses are the most common pathogen associated with severe respiratory diseases (e.g., bronchiolitis), exacerbation of asthma, or pneumonia in early life and are leading cause of hospitalization in children under two [5] [6] [7] .",

Children aged 2 to 60 months with symptoms and signs of acute respiratory tract infections suggested by WHO were included [9] . WHO classification of acute respiratory tract infection in children presenting with cough, difficult breathing, or both is as follows: pneumoniarespiratory rate per minute >50 breaths (2-11 months of age) or >40 breaths (12-59 months of age); no lower chest indrawing; severe pneumonia-symptoms of pneumonia, and lower chest indrawing with or without rapid breathing; very severe disease-symptoms of severe pneumonia, inability to drink, convulsions, central cyanosis, being abnormally sleepy or difficulty to wake, stridor in calm child, or clinically severe malnutrition. Those with suspected bacterial etiology (e.g., streptococcal sore throat, lobar pneumonia, pneumatocele, and empyema), underlying chronic conditions, HIV, illness lasting more than a week, severe malnutrition, and those hospitalized in last one month were excluded. The Institute Ethics Committee approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal guardians. Nasal and throat swabs were collected and pooled into tubes containing 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM, Copan, Brescia, Italy) and kept in refrigerator at 2 to 8 \u2218 C. Then the samples were transported over ice to the laboratory (Regional Medical Research Centre, ICMR) situated at Bhubaneswar, a Grade 1 equipped virological laboratory [10] . Samples were kept there in \u221280 \u2218 C until further processing. Total nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 L of each specimen using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all collected specimens, PCR or RT-PCRs were performed to detect infection with RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV, adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human corona virus (hCoV), enterovirus (EV), and RV. The method used for each virus is described in the following references: PIVs 1-4, EV, RV [8] , IFV (A, B, and C), and RSV (A and B) [11] were detected by two multiplex nested RT-PCRs; hCoV [12] and hMPV [13] by two-step RT-PCR; ADV [14] by single-step PCR; and hBoV by touchdown PCR [15] . RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript II onestep RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). All products underwent electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. Typing for IFV, PIV, and RSV was performed according to PCR product size.",

RSV (25.8%), RV (21.9%), IFV (21%), and ADV (12.5%) were the most prevalent single viruses isolated from all the ARI cases. The most common viruses isolated from acute URI cases were RV (32.6%), ADV in the month of January, December, and August. In URIs, the most common age group affected was >12-60 mo, and in LRIs, the most common age group affected was 2-12 mo. Present study results are similar to the previous study results from India. In the study by Broor et al., RSV, IFV-A, and PIV-3 were important causes of ARI in children under five in the rural Indian community [8] . In the study by Singh et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (21.3%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by IFV (9.0%), measles (8.5%), and ADV (5.3%) [16] . In the study by Bharaj et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (58.1%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by PIV (22%), hMPV (10.5%), and IFV-A (9.3%) [17] ADV (1.5%) [18] . In the study by Yeolekar et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (26%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by IFV (5.4%), PIV (2.07%), and ADV (0.8%) [19] . Panda et al. recently found RV as the most frequently detected pathogen (24.7%) followed by RSV (4.22%), PIV (2.11%), and hMPV (2.11%) in children with ARI from Eastern India [20] . In the present study, we found RV as the second most important agent to RSV causing ARI in young infants and children. The present study findings are more or less similar to the recently published studies from other parts of the globe, though the most prevalent virus may be different [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Similar was finding by previous studies [8, 16, 17] . Infants <12 mo age were most commonly positive for RSV and less commonly for IFV, the latter occurring commonly beyond infancy in older children. This is because maternal antibody protection against RSV during infancy remains questionable, and as the child grows, the immunity builds up against RSV due to repeated exposures [28] . IFV due to marked antigenic diversity evades the herd immunity and does not give long lasting immunity. Therefore, the susceptibility to IFV increases as the child grows [29] . ADV is uncommon during first six months, where maternal antibody confers protection [30] .",

One study observed that significantly higher number of children below 12 mo of age had RSV infection, those presenting with preceding bronchiolitis were significantly associated with virus positivity, and ARI in family was significantly associated with virus positivity [17] . In another study, patients testing positive for viruses showed significantly high percentage of cough, nasal discharge, and diarrhea [16] . We found a significantly higher number of children below 12 mo being virus positive, those presenting with preceding bronchiolitis being significantly associated 6 International Journal of Pediatrics with virus positivity, rhinorrhea significantly presenting in the virus positive group, and ARI in family being significantly associated with virus positivity. The respiratory illness exhibits a clear-cut seasonality, and all the published studies till date support this. However, there may be some difference in the seasonality. Most of the studies report increased incidence of acute respiratory infection (both URI and LRI) during winter and fall season [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . This is because of the following sequence of events: decrease in air temperature causing decrease in the nasal airway temperature (compromised cooling of the nasal airway) leading to poor defence against infection (because of decrease mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis) [31] . In the present study, the incidence of both URI and LRI was higher in winter season (as upper airway acts as an entry point to lower airway). However, an additional peak of acute LRI was also found during August. Though this cannot be solely explained based on the above hypothesis, it may be because of an increase in the birth cohort during this period [32] .",

First, good hand hygiene, maintenance of warm temperature in the living place/avoidance of exposure to sudden cold temperature, avoidance of taking of freeze dried/cold food items, and wearing of the mask to prevent spread of the infection should be practiced. Second, the nutritional status of the children in the community should be improved as malnutrition predisposes to increase risk of infection and severe illness. Third, vaccines should be developed against respiratory viruses (including against the new viruses) to decrease the morbidity and mortality from respiratory illness. Fourth, any child with ARI and viral coinfection should be closely monitored for development of complications/severe illness.",
