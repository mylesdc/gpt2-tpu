The first and second author then drafted the webpages. An informal mapping process was employed to check that each of the relevant factors identified from theory and literature had been addressed (there was insufficient time to carry out an exhaustive, systematic reviewing and intervention mapping process). To check that the intervention was effectively addressing the right behaviors and determinants we also carried out four empirical studies, as follows:",

We then carried out a qualitative study (N = 31) to determine which of these were also viewed as feasible and acceptable by our target population, and what factors would influence their adherence to the behaviors. Participants were invited to discuss their perceptions of infection transmission and likely adherence to infection control measures in both non-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Infection control measures discussed included handwashing, social distancing and cough hygiene (e.g. covering mouth, disposing of tissues immediately etc.). Thematic analysis revealed that handwashing was regarded by our participants as more feasible than cough and sneeze hygiene and more acceptable than social distancing, and identified a number of factors that were potential barriers to carrying out infection control behaviors.",

Participants (N = 84) completed a self-report web-delivered questionnaire measuring intentions to engage in hand-washing and hypothesized behavioral determinants of intentions, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Protection Motivation Theory. In a factorial 2X2 design half the participants were first randomized to receive messages about potential negative consequences of pandemic flu (the 'high threat' condition) and half were assigned to receive 'coping' messages describing the rationale and effectiveness of hand-washing for reducing the risk of infection. This study provided encouraging confirmation that our intervention development was proceeding correctly. Our measures of intentions proved sensitive to group differences, and the behavioral determinants we included in the study explained a substantial proportion of the variance in intentions. The study also provided useful indications that our high threat message might increase hand-washing intentions, that providing hand-gel might be beneficial, and that it would be necessary to actively manage the risk of selective dropout in the intervention group.",
