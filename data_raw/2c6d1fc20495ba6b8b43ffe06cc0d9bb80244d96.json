The stability of the siRNA in cells was monitored by flow cytometry. The antiviral effect of siRNA was evaluated by measurement of cell survival rate using the MTT method and viral RNA was quantitated with real-time RT-PCR. The presence of cells containing siRNA at 0.25, 1, 3, 5, 7 days after transfection were 66.0%, 52.1%, 32.0%, 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. After 7 days incubation with DEN, there was reduced cytopathic effect, increased cell survival rate (76.9 \u00b1 4.5% vs 23.6 \u00b1 14.6%) and reduced viral RNA copies (Ct value 19.91 \u00b1 0.63 vs 14.56 \u00b1 0.39) detected in transfected C6/36 cells. Conclusions: Our data showed that synthetic siRNA against the DEN-1 membrane glycoprotein precursor gene effectively inhibited DEN-1 viral RNA replication and increased C6/36 cell survival rate. siRNA may offer a potential new strategy for prevention and treatment of DEN infection.",

Upon introduction into the cells, exogenous dsRNAs are cut into 21-25 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) by an RNase III-like enzyme called Dicer. The siRNAs form RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with other cellular components, and lead to the cleavage of their homologous transcript and eventually the silencing of specific gene [9] [10] [11] . RNAi is believed to be an effective endogenous mechanism for host cells to defense against virus attack [12] , and has been applied as an exogenous measure to inhibit viral replication, such as HIV [13, 14] , influenza A virus [15] , HBV [16] and SARS-CoV [17] .",

            "text": "DEN is one of the first animal viruses that could be efficiently inhibited by RNAi [12, 18] . Like other flaviviruses, DEN generates intracellular dsRNA as an intermediate of their replication, which may induce RNAi in the host cells. A new explanation for mosquitoes' non-pathogenic and persistent infections of DEN is that RNAi could be an important modulator [19] . Exogenous long length dsRNA corresponding to DEN sequences, introduced by either plasmid or Sindbis viruses, has been proven to mediate RNAi in mosquito C6/36 Cells and lead to inhibition of DEN replication in cultured mosquito cells [20, 21] . Genetically modified Aedes aegypti has been raised to develop dengue virus resistance [22] [23] [24] . The mixtures of DEN specific small interfering RNAs, the hallmark of RNAi, were detected in all aforementioned studies. But little was known about the role of single siRNA with particular target sequence in the inhibition of DEN replication. Our present study was designed to investigate if a single siRNA has the inhibitory effect on DEN-1 replication in mosquito cells. Effects of siRNA on C6/36 survival to DEN challenge CPE in each group was observed at the 7 th dpi. The virus positive control group and control siRNA group showed a large number of CPE up to ++++, characterized by cell swelling and fusing, and reduced cell number; while normal group and siRNA group showed no CPE and no observable decrease in cell number. The cell survival rate of C6/36 cells, measured by MTT assay, of siRNA group was 76.9% \u00b1 4.5%, control-siRNA group was 43.9% \u00b1 3.6%, and virus positive control group was 23.6% \u00b1 14.6%. Compared with virus positive control group, the cell survival rate of siRNA group increased by 2.26-fold (n = 5, P < 0.05), but siRNA control group showed no significant difference (n = 5, P > 0.05) ( Figure 2 ).",

This likely happened at the moment between the uncoating of viral RNA and the viral replication [25] . Virus resistance has been proven to be generated by RNAi triggered from exogenous DEN-specific dsRNA. Adelman et al. [20] showed this resistance by a 290 nt dsRNA homologous to the type II dengue virus PrM gene which was expressed by plasmid, in cultured mosquito C6/36 cells. Travanty et al. [23] developed transgenic mosquito lines that transcribed the same 290 nt dsRNA with insect promoters, but failed to express in critical site for DEN replication such as midguts. Franz et al. [24] increased the size of dsRNA to 578 nt and succeeded in midgut expression and viral transmission diminishing. In addition to DEN-2, alternation of the replication kinetics of DEN-1 has also proven to be triggered by dsRNA in C6/36 cells [26] . However, long dsRNA fragments are associated with higher cost in synthesis, poorer stability, and raise the chance for mismatch rate. At the same time, introduction of dsRNAs longer than 30 base pairs into mammalian cells will activate the potent interferon and protein kinase R antiviral pathways, resulting in non-sequencespecific effects that can include apoptosis [27] . Therefore, these disadvantages largely restrict the use of long dsRNA in pre-clinical and clinical applications.",

Therefore, in this study, we designed and synthesized 21 nt siRNAs against the DEN-I viral PrM gene, and investigated their inhibition effects of dengue virus replication in transfected C6/36 cells. In four siRNAs we designed, only one showed the function to reduce CPE after DEN infection.

These data indicate that siRNA against DEN viral genome can effectively inhibit viral RNA replication in the C6/36 cells, protect host cell from viral attack, suggesting its potential role in prevention and treatment of dengue fever. Recent study have shown [19] that Aedes aegypti can produce dsRNAs homologous to dengue viral genes and trigger an intrinsic siRNA anti-viral action, but this endogenous anti-viral mechanism can not effectively inhibit the replication of dengue virus. Data presented in our study revealed that exogenous siRNA in Aedes albopictus cells is effective in inhibiting viral DNA replication. Therefore, it is possible that the anti-viral mechanisms mediated by exogenous and endogenous siRNAs may act synergistically in the protection of cells from viral attacks, although this hypothesis needs further researches to prove.",
