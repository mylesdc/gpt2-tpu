            "text": "Influenza viruses are the major pathogens causing respiratory diseases with severe morbidity and mortality worldwide [1] . Novel and recombinant strains of influenza viruses have caused pandemics resulting in millions of deaths. The rapid detection of these viruses is essential for a medical response and infection control [1] . A low-cost and rapid identification of influenza types and subtypes in clinical patients is essential for initial clinical treatment and avoidance of antibiotic misuse, as well as prevention of influenza virus transmission, especially in resourcelimited regions [1] . Molecular assays are highly sensitive and specific for detecting influenza viruses such as rapid immune colloidal gold diagnostic tests, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral culture. Nucleic acid based tests for respiratory viruses are currently used as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic approach for clinical specimens. A cost-effective, accurate and rapid multiplex assay is highly desirable in clinical virology laboratories for testing and diagnosing common and emerging viruses. Even though the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of respiratory viruses, such assays are limited to a maximum of four multiplexed targets, and the high cost of reagents and equipment involved is particularly limiting for laboratories with low financial constraints [2] . Therefore, a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) technology was developed to solve these problems. The DPO primer contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker, which assumes a bubble-like structure not involved in priming, but which delineates the boundary between two regions of the primer [3] . This structure confers distinct annealing properties on the two primer segments. The longer 5\u2032-segment initiates stable priming, while the short 3\u2032-segment determines targetspecific extension [3] . The advantage of DPO based PCR is the blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates under less than optimal PCR conditions [3] . DPO technology was commercialized and used in many recent studies to test different respiratory viruses [3] . Additionally, several studies have compared DPO based multiplex PCR with other rapid methods for the detection of influenza viruses. The results suggested that the DPO based multiplex PCR system had a higher sensitivity and specificity than the other methods tested [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, most of these recent studies, including those using commercial DPO based rapid detection kits, tested numerous different respiratory viruses or different types of influenza viruses. Only one commercial kit (Seeplex\u00ae Influenza A/B OneStep Typing, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) can simultaneously detect influenza A, B and subtypes of influenza A including 2009 pandemic H1 and Human Seasonal Influenza A (H1 and H3). Recently, the live poultry market has posed a high risk for human infection following the avian infection in Beijing, China [8] . The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was identified in local poultry and wild birds is enzootic in China [8] . Therefore, it is important to develop a rapid and simple method to detect avian influenza viruses. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the development of a DPO multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of influenza A, B and subtypes of influenza A including H5N1.",

Although the use of conventional primer has a low cost and requires less technical training for lab technicians, this approach often produces false positive results with low sensitivity and specificity. The use of conventional primers has a number of disadvantages including primer competition, primer dimers and varing anealing temperatures required for different primers. The current use of multiplex conventional PCR requires further validation including nested PCR or probe hybridization assay to verify the results [17] . In addition to the use of PCR methods, the rapid detection of influenza virus can also be carried out using the immune colloidal gold technique supplied as commercial kits. The current study demonstrated that this rapid detection method had the lowest sensitivity and specificity for virus detection when compared with the three different PCR based methods (Figure 8 ).",

However, the World Health Organization strongly suggests that the assay should be repeated to verify the diagnostic result if the Cq value is in the range 30-35 as determined by qPCR [10] . From the comparative study of positive specimens detected by qPCR and multiplex DPO PCR in this study, 89.3% of influenza A positive specimens were observed at a higher Cq range (30 < Cq < 35). The analytic results from influenza B testing indicated that 96.5% samples were in the Cq range from 30 to 35 ( Figure 10 ). The high percentage of qPCR positive specimens not detected by multiplex DPO PCR might have had a low target concentration or were degraded by re-freezing of the sample [4] .",

Furthermore, the sensitivity of DPO PCR was higher than for the immunochromatographic assay, lower than for qPCR and similar to conventional single PCR for the detection of influenza A and B. Multiplex DPO PCR is cost-effective, has a short running time and low technical requirements indicating its significant potential for influenza virus detection, early diagnosis and treatment in clinical laboratories.

RT-qPCR data was analyzed by SDS software from Applied Biosystems\u00ae. Amplification curves were evaluated by the threshold line being placed above the background signal, intersecting the initial exponential phase of the curve. Amplification of influenza virus was observed at a quantification cycle (Cq) value of 35. A test result was considered positive when a well-defined curve that crossed the threshold cycle within 35 cycles was observed.The detection kit used in our study was from Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd. A 25 \u03bcl reaction system was set up containing 2 \u03bcl template RNA, 0.125 \u03bcl Takara Taq (250 U/\u03bcl), 0.5 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 PCR Buffer (Mg2+ Plus), dNTP mixture (2.5 mM) and 17.4 \u03bcl RNase free water. The test was performed using a Applied Biosystems\u00ae 2720 Thermal Cycler. The PCR reaction was amplified under the following conditions: pre-denaturation step for 5 min at 94\u00b0C, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.",
