Changes in clinical features and laboratory findings of KD were evaluated over a period of 10 years. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of KD patients and compared the clinical and laboratory features of two KD patient groups: those admitted from 2000 to 2004 (group A, 284 cases) and those admitted from 2010 to 2014 (group B, 331 cases).",

Incomplete KD patients had milder values in some laboratory indices. The preadmission and total fever durations were longer in group A than in group B. The proportion of incomplete KD was higher in group B, but incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) was lower. For laboratory indices, the C-reactive protein and follow-up platelet values were lower, and the hemoglobin and albumin values were higher in group B. The same clinical and laboratory findings were confirmed in the KD subgroups; those with the same fever duration of 5 or 6 days and same ages, those with complete KD, and those with incomplete KD in the two different time periods. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that clinical features of KD tend to be milder over time and manifest in a higher incidence of incomplete KD, lower incidence of CALs, and less severe laboratory findings in recent KD patients in Korea compared with their historic counterparts.",

            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting systemic inflammation that can involve multiple organs, especially the heart via coronary artery lesions (CALs) [1] . KD is a newly appeared disease in the East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China; though infantile polyarteritis nodosa, which may be a severe form of KD, has been reported in the Western countries since the late nineteenth century [2] . KD began being reported in Asian countries in specific time periods: in the early 1960s in Japan, 1970s in Korea and in 1970-80s in Taiwan and China, and possibly 1990s in India and other economically grown Asian countries [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , which suggests that economic growth and westernization of these countries are associated with the emergence of KD [8, 9] . KD has shown epidemiological characteristics in these countries; it has the same age predilection of 6 months-4 years and has become a nationwide endemic disease within 2 decades with the incidence slowly increasing after its first report. Additionally, KD occurs throughout the year with slight monthly and regional variations. On the other hand, the incidence of KD in Western countries is lower by tenth to one twentieth to Asian countries and has plateaued during recent decades [10] . These unique epidemiological characteristics are not observed in any newly emerging infectious diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thus, it is proposed that KD may be an acute immune-mediated disease that develops after an infection with an unknown pathogen(s) in genetically susceptible immune-immature young children, and that the immunopathogenesis of KD may be similar to that of infection-related immunemediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever rather than that of infectious disease such as scarlet fever [9] .",

            "text": "In the present study, we found that KD patients in Korea are increasing, but clinical and laboratory features might be changing to milder phenotypes over time. Nationwide epidemiological studies have indicated that the proportion of patients with incomplete KD was as high as 20% in 2007-2008 in Japan [23] , and 42.2% of patients in 2009-2011 in Korea with no fatalities [15] . In this study, we confirmed this trend as well as in our previous studies [16, 17] , the proportion of incomplete KD significantly increased from 26.4% in 2000-2004 to 46.2% in 2010-2014. In the present study, we found that incomplete KD patients had fewer cases of repeated IVIG treatment (5.7% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.015) and less severe values of some laboratory indices such as WBC differentials, CRP, albumin and ALT, but the rate of CALs in the incomplete KD patients was not different from that in complete KD patients (20.2% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.75) ( Table 1) . Other studies have also indicated that incomplete KD and complete KD patients had similar laboratory findings with similar incidences of CALs [24, 25] . These findings suggest that KD may appear as various phenotypes and immune responses against KD pathogen(s) and/or insults from the infection are similar in both KD patient groups, with individual variations such as involvement of ALT/ALT elevation and CALs. Thus, Values are mean \u00b1 SD or n (%). Abbreviations as in Table 1 Values are mean \u00b1 SD or n (%). Abbreviations as in Table 1 our results suggest that patients with incomplete KD may have milder clinical manifestations with less systemic inflammation reflected by some laboratory parameters compared to patients with complete KD. As for incomplete KD patients, Pediatricians in Korea have skillfully used other signs such as skin changes at the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin inoculation site for infants or slit lamp examination to search the anterior uveitis for older children [26, 27] , as well as laboratory findings. The reduced risk of CALs in recent patients in this study could be attributable to early diagnosis and early IVIG in incomplete KD treatment as suggested in other studies [14, 15, 23] . Our KD patents in the 2010-2014 group also visited the hospital earlier (4.9 days vs. 4.2 days, P < 0.001) and subsequently they were treated with IVIG earlier than the patients in the past KD group. On the other hand, the complete and incomplete KD groups had the same preadmission fever duration (4.5 days vs. 4.6 days, P = 0.80), and incomplete KD patients received IVIG treatment later than complete KD patients (1.4 days vs. 1.1 days, P < 0.001), but there were no differences in CALs in the two groups. Therefore, other factors may also be associated with the low rate of CALs in recent years.",

This was satisfied by all KD patients in this study, with each patient confirming platelet elevation during admission. In addition, we found that the platelet count and immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA levels increased in the early convalescent stage of KD, and the extent of increase in these parameters correlated with each other [unpublished observation]. These findings suggest that platelets and immunoglobulins may be involved in the recovery from KD and the extent of increased the parameters in the subacute stage may reflect the extent of systemic inflammation. This characteristic of KD inflammation could be helpful for KD patient selection after IVIG therapy.",
