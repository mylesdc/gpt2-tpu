Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations.

We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a ''mild-to-moderate'' pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as ''avoidable'' mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored.",

Indeed, the vast majority of previous health system analyses in relation to pandemic influenza have focused on developed countries [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , while the capacity of health systems in low and middle income countries remains largely unstudied. Paradoxically, understanding outbreak response capacity in low and middle-income countries is arguably of greater importance than that in developed countries, not only because health systems are weaker [12] , but also because many of these countries are in regions where the risk of emerging infectious diseases is highest [13] . Moreover, these countries may suffer disproportionately because of associations between morbidity, pandemic influenza and poverty [14] .",

In the Southeast Asia region, while surveillance and outbreak response capacities have been strengthened in hope of early detection and control of outbreaks, there has been much less investment into preparing health systems for pandemic mitigation [17] . Modeling studies have been used to inform optimum intervention strategies for responding to pandemic influenza, but often neglect to take into account feasibility of health systems to implement such a response and the potential impact of resource shortages on the pandemic burden. Investigation of health system capacity in East and Southeast Asia is of particular interest, not only given the fertile conditions for the emergence and spread of new diseases [13, 18] , but also the wide socio-economic inequalities within the region, and focus of investment by the international community into pandemic influenza preparedness [19] . Resource gaps for a pandemic response are likely to be wide and vary greatly between and within countries in Asia [20] . But exactly how wide are these gaps, what are the consequences of the gaps in terms of the pandemic disease burden, and to what extent could these consequences be mitigated by improving resource allocation and mobilization?",

Briefly, the model is based on a deterministic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered/removed) model described by differential equations tracking number of people in each compartment over time. Given that the primary aim of this analysis was to provide relative estimates of resource gaps within and across countries, rather than to accurately simulate the spread of pandemic influenza throughout each country, the model structure was kept relatively simple, with homogeneous mixing patterns and no age-structure assumed within the modeled population. However, novel complexity is incorporated through making parameters describing the clinical course of infected individuals conditional upon the availability of certain key health system resources (antivirals, beds, and ventilators). Thus we could obtain relative indications of the consequences of resource shortages on the pandemic disease burden, specifically in terms of ''avoidable deaths'', which we define as deaths that would not have occurred in the presence of sufficient resources.",

These assumptions regarding resource spare capacity and oseltamivir usage were relaxed in a multivariate uncertainty analysis (described below).

The corresponding statistical distributions of resource capacities across areas within each country can be found in Figure S1 . A summary of overall resource gaps for each country is presented in Table 1 . There was substantial variation in resource gaps both between and within countries, and across resources types (Figures 1 and S1) . Overall, the biggest gaps were generally seen in Cambodia and Lao PDR, particularly when standardized by population size, with almost all provinces in these countries displaying gaps in all resources, with the exception of nurses which were estimated to be sufficient in approximately half of the provinces in these countries. In contrast, relatively few provinces in Taiwan were estimated to have gaps, at least in general health system resources (beds, ventilators, and human resources), with quantities of these resources often considerably above those predicted to be needed for this scenario. Nevertheless, almost half of provinces in Taiwan were predicted to have insufficient oseltamivir supplies to treat all severe cases (although it should be noted that the results in Figures 1 and S1 do not account for central stockpiles which might be mobilized in the event of a pandemic, as discussed later).",

(A corresponding map showing absolute numbers of estimated avoidable death is given in Figure S2 .) Figure 3 shows estimated avoidable death rates attributable to gaps in each resource type (antivirals, beds and ventilators) aggregated across all provinces in each country, and accounting for uncertainty in resource effectiveness and spare capacity. Avoidable deaths for a given resource gap were estimated by calculating the number of deaths that would be prevented by filling that resource gap only. Figures 2 and 3 highlight how resource gaps could have a substantial impact on mortality rates during an influenza pandemic. A combination of the large population size and shortage of ventilators results in the estimation that, out of the five countries for which nationwide data were collected, Vietnam would have the highest total number of avoidable deaths. However, the results for Jakarta and Bali suggest that Indonesia would have the highest avoidable death toll if the data is extrapolated across the entire population of this country. When standardized by population size, the highest rates of avoidable deaths were estimated in Cambodia and Lao PDR, accounting for over half of all pandemic-associated mortalities in these countries. The median avoidable death rates for these countries were over 15 times higher than that for Taiwan, where a relatively low proportion (median: 7.6%, IQR: 5.5-10.7%) of total deaths was estimated to be due to resource gaps. Almost all avoidable deaths in Taiwan were predicted to be due to local shortages of oseltamivir. In all other countries shortages of ventilators were estimated to be the biggest cause of avoidable deaths (Figure 3 ). In Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam, this result was largely robust to uncertainty surrounding resource effectiveness and spare capacity. For Cambodia and Thailand, however, the uncertainty analysis suggested that gaps in oseltamivir might also be a main cause of avoidable deaths (Figure 3 ). When adding an additional layer of uncertainty to the model assumptions, by allowing for up to 5% of mild cases to be treated with oseltamivir, the increased shortages of the latter further increased uncertainty surrounding the relative importance of gaps in oseltamivir ( Figure S3 ). Given such uncertainties and the sensitivity of results to model assumptions, the proportion of mortalities that can be attributed to gaps in specific resources should be interpreted with some caution.",

Our estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortality rates at country level show a clear association with national GDP. This result is consistent with a previous analysis of data from the 1918 influenza pandemic, which found that per capita income explained a large proportion of the variation in mortality across countries during the pandemic period [14] . Moreover, extrapolation of these mortality rates to the 2004 world population suggested that around 96% of deaths from pandemic influenza would occur in developing countries [14] . Our results suggest that, due to inequitable distribution of resources, the variation in pandemic burden is likely to be profound within, as well as between, countries. Countries which have experienced the highest burden of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1), namely Vietnam and Indonesia, appear to be most prepared in terms of the availability and geographical distribution of oseltamivir. In the other study countries, we estimated that central stockpiles of oseltamivir would be sufficient to cover any provincial gaps for treating all severe cases from the modeled scenario, and thus mobilization of this resource could potentially avert a large number of avoidable mortalities in these countries. Indeed, in all countries except Vietnam, we estimated that optimum mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could save more than 10% of avoidable deaths. While timely mobilization of resources may be possible in Taiwan, with its small geographical size and relatively developed infrastructure, the feasibility of this scenario is questionable in the poorer, and larger, countries of the Mekong region, where it might be prudent to disburse central stockpiles of antiviral drugs to provincial and district health facilities prior to an outbreak.",

In reality, surge capacity is likely to vary substantially between and within countries (and over time), but few data on this are available. Robust analytical frameworks are urgently needed to define and measure health system surge capacity in order to inform analyses of resource gaps for emergency response scenarios. The effectiveness of resources such as antiviral drugs, ventilators, and general hospital care for improving the survival rates among severe influenza cases is also surrounded by considerable uncertainty and may vary between settings. Our results show that, even if epidemiological parameters describing transmission and pathogenicity are kept constant, uncertainties in spare capacity and resource effectiveness lead to considerable uncertainties in estimates of avoidable mortalities rates. Nevertheless, the distributions of model outputs from our multivariate uncertainty analysis still showed some significant differences when compared across countries and across resource types (Figures 3 and 5) .

However, the same cannot be said for the relative importance of gaps in different resource types. Thus, although our results generally suggest that shortages of ventilators could be a major cause of avoidable deaths in low-and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia, investment in this resource should not necessarily be prioritized over other healthcare resources. A natural extension of this study would be to investigate the cost-effectiveness of investing different types of health systems resources for mitigating the burden of an influenza pandemic. However, more data on the effectiveness of different resources for managing severe influenza cases is needed before such assessments can be made.",

In reality, heterogeneities in factors such as age-structure, geographic structure, population density, human behavior, and the underlying health of the population are all likely to play a role in transmission dynamics and burden of influenza. A previous modeling analysis, for example, has shown that higher levels of population heterogeneities, such as in age and spatial structuring of contacts, result in lower overall attack rates and peak prevalence for a given basic reproduction number [33] . However, there is a lack of data on such heterogeneities and how they might affect patterns of pandemic progression for our study region. Ongoing studies, such as contact pattern surveys in Asia similar to those undertaken in Europe [34] , are attempting to rectify this. Another limitation is that the resource data were collected between May and September 2009, which includes the first wave of the H1N1-2009 pandemic; thus some resource data (particularly for antiviral stockpiles) may be influenced by the time point within this period at which the data were recorded.",

Rather, they highlight the scale of health system inequalities within and across countries in Asia, and the considerable impact such inequalities could have on the pandemic disease burden. By indicating the relative disparities in resource availability within and across countries, and the potential consequences of resource shortages, these results could help guide investment decisions in scaling up resources to mitigate the burden Figure 5 . Estimated impact of resource mobilization/redistribution across provinces on avoidable mortality rates within each territory. Data were calculated by estimating the number of avoidable deaths if available resources (including central stockpiles for oseltamivir) within each territory were geographically distributed in proportion to provincial population size, and comparing with the total number of avoidable deaths predicted given actual resource distribution. Boxplots show medians, interquartile ranges, and 95 th percentile ranges derived from a multivariate uncertainty analysis.
