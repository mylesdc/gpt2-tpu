            "text": "Functioning as an extracellular protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) preferentially cleaves the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue. We report here that DPP-IV cleaves the first two amino acids from insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), revealed by mass spectrometry. The kinetic parameters of the proteolytic cleavage indicate that this reaction is physiologically relevant. Interestingly, truncated IGF-1 is less potent than the full-length protein in activating the IGF-1R, but binds more readily to IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of DPP-IV mRNA is dramatically lower in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues than in adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues. However, this reduction was not observed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Our study suggests a possible link between IGF-1 and DPP-IV in cancer development in a specific tumor niche. A DPP-IV-related pathway may be important in mitigating IGF-1 signaling. Consequently, a robust IGF signaling pathway may accelerate early carcinogenesis in environments lacking DPP-IV.

Its catalytic domain is located extracellularly, anchored to the membrane by a single transmembrane domain. DPP-IV dimerization is essential for its enzymatic activity (2) (3) (4) . The substrates of DPP-IV are small oligopeptides, including hormones, chemokines, and neuropeptides (5) (6) (7) (8) . DPP-IV is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Interestingly, the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV is reduced in the sera of patients with melanomas or oral cancers (9, 10) . Attenuated DPP-IV expression on the cell surface is also observed in malignant cells, such as melanomas and lung nonadenocarcinomas (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . In melanocytes, the elimination of DPP-IV occurs concomitantly with growth factor independence (14, 15) . Re-expression of DPP-IV in these melanoma cells suppresses the malignant phenotype of the melanocytic cells (16) . In human nonadenocarcinoma cancers, the enzymatic activity and expression of DPP-IV is dramatically reduced compared with those in normal bronchial and lung alveolar epithelia (11) . Interestingly, the reexpression of DPP-IV in lung cancer cells inhibits tumor events, such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and tumorigenicity, in nude mice (17) . The mechanisms of DPP-IV downregulation and tumor growth in these tissues are not yet clear.",

A single polypeptide of 70 amino acids, IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) with high affinity (20, 21) . The biological function of IGF-1 is mediated through IGF-1R tyrosine kinase signaling. IGF-1R phosphorylates several downstream adaptor proteins, thus activating distinct downstream signaling pathways, including the AKT, RAF, and MAPK pathways (22) . The physiological concentration of IGF-1 is tightly regulated. The total concentration of IGF-1 in the blood is 10-40 nM (23) (24) (25) . The IGF-1 concentration is controlled by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which bind free IGF-1 (23) (24) (25) . Among these, IGFBP3 is the main IGF-1-sequestering protein, because of its abundance and high affinity for IGF-1 (21, 26) . The remaining free IGF-1 constitutes less than 1% of the total IGF-1 concentration (23, 26) . Given the tight binding between IGF-1 and IGFBPs (K d =0.06-0.22 nM) (21) , the sequestering of IGF-1 by IGFBPs effectively reduces the amount of IGF-1 available to activate IGF-1R. In this way, IGFBPs negatively regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1.",

The precipitates were resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 mM NaCl (pH7.4), and the solution was then passed through a nickel affinity column.

FAP was purified with His\u2022Bind Resin (Novagen) and HiTrap Q Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). Specifically, the culture medium of High Five\u2122 cells expressing FAP was collected and the protein precipitated by the addition of 3.8 M ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation.

Finally, the FAP protein was eluted in a 0-500 mM NaCl gradient in buffer A. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. DPP-IV or FAP was incubated with IGF-1 or peptide in an assay buffer of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) overnight at 37\u00b0C.

Therefore, the cleavage of IGF-1 by FAP was also investigated. First, the peptide GPETLCGAEL (the first 10 amino acids at the N-terminus of IGF-1) was incubated with DPP-IV. HPLC analysis identified the dipeptide Gly-Pro and the octapeptide ETLCGAEL as the products of DPP-IV digestion (Fig. 1A) . The identities of these two cleavage products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). Under the same reaction conditions, FAP did not cleave GPETLCGAEL (data not shown). We next investigated whether DPP-IV cleaves full-length IGF-1. IGF-1 has a molecular mass of 7650 daltons (Fig. 1B) . After incubation with DPP-IV, the molecular mass of IGF-1 decreased to 7500 daltons, which corresponds to the de-letion of the Gly-Pro dipeptide at the amino terminus (Fig.  1C) . The molecular mass of IGF-1 did not change when incubated with FAP (Fig. 1D) . These data indicate that DPP-IV specifically cleaves the N-terminus of IGF-1, producing the Gly-Pro dipeptide.",

The prevailing model is that activated fibroblasts in tumors modify the phenotype of the epithelial cells via soluble and diffusible growth factors (37) . These growth factors, including IGF-1, accelerate cell proliferation, modify the extracellular matrix, promote angiogenesis, and increase inflammatory cell recruitment (37) . The proteolytic processing of IGF-1 by DPP-IV may represent a defense mechanism that mitigates IGF-1 activity in normal cells (Fig. 7A) . Here, we provide evidence that IGF-1 activity is regulated by proteolytic processing by DPP-IV. The attenuation of IGF-1 signaling may be achieved by both a reduction in IGF-1R activation and increased IGF-1-IGFBP3 binding (Figs. [3] [4] [5] . The K m of IGF-1 cleavage by DPP-IV is similar to the range reported for other physiological substrates of DPP-IV, including GLP1 and GIP (5) (6) (7) (8) . Consequently, IGF-1 could be a biological substrate of DPP-IV. Finally, DPP-IV is downregu-lated to almost undetectable levels in SCC, whereas there is no significant change in DPP-IV levels in ADC, suggesting that separate mechanisms underlie the development of these two cancer subtypes.",

            "text": "The catalytic efficiency of DPP-IV for IGF-1 is close to the reported catalytic efficiencies of MMP and 90 M -1 s -1 for ADAM10 against CD23 (36)). Such slow catalytic rates might be characteristic of and critical for these extracellular proteases to maintain the homeostasis of the stromal microenvironment. The cleavages are slow and take hours. It is unclear whether this is the reason for the past failure to observe IGF-1 cleavage by DPP-IV in vitro (7) . Recently, Faidley et al. (2006) reported no significant change in circulating IGF-1 levels when the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin was administered to pigs for three days (44) . It remains to be investigated how stable T-IGF1 is in vivo and whether these measurements are the composite of both intact and truncated IGF-1 proteins.",

The residues that interact with IGFBPs are located at the B (residues 1-29) and A domains (residues 42-62) of IGF-1 (45) . Based on the cocrystal structure of IGF-1 with either the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of IGFBP, several residues of IGF-1 seem to be engaged in the interaction (46) . Mutations at these residues, such as Glu3, significantly reduce the binding of IGF-1 to IGFBPs (48) . Site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays have suggested that the binding of IGF-1 to IGF1R occurs between the C and D domains of IGF-1, which differs from the binding between IGF-1 and IGFBPs (46) . Therefore, the weaker activation of IGF-1R by T-IGF1 is probably attributable to the conformational change caused by the lack of two amino acids at the amino terminus.",

Because DPP-IV inhibitors are currently used to treat human type II diabetes (50, 51) , their potential long-term impact on the balance between cell growth and apoptosis in this niche warrants further investigation.",
