            "text": "A key priority in infectious disease research is to understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of viral diseases from data on disease incidence as well as viral genetic and antigenic variation. We propose using a simulation-based, Bayesian method known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit and assess phylodynamic models that simulate pathogen evolution and ecology against summaries of these data. We illustrate the versatility of the method by analyzing two spatial models describing the phylodynamics of interpandemic human influenza virus subtype A(H3N2). The first model captures antigenic drift phenomenologically with continuously waning immunity, and the second epochal evolution model describes the replacement of major, relatively long-lived antigenic clusters. Combining features of long-term surveillance data from the Netherlands with features of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene sequences sampled in northern Europe, key phylodynamic parameters can be estimated with ABC. Goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the irregularity in interannual incidence and H3N2's ladder-like hemagglutinin phylogeny are quantitatively only reproduced under the epochal evolution model within a spatial context. However, the concomitant incidence dynamics result in a very large reproductive number and are not consistent with empirical estimates of H3N2's population level attack rate. These results demonstrate that the interactions between the evolutionary and ecological processes impose multiple quantitative constraints on the phylodynamic trajectories of influenza A(H3N2), so that sequence and surveillance data can be used synergistically. ABC, one of several data synthesis approaches, can easily interface a broad class of phylodynamic models with various types of data but requires careful calibration of the summaries and tolerance parameters.

One of the perhaps best documented examples are human influenza A viruses, which cause substantial morbidity and mortality as they escape host immunity predominantly through the evolution of their surface antigens [2] . The resulting, dynamical interaction between the ecological and evolutionary processess can be better understood through the formulation and simulation of so-called ''phylodynamic'' mathematical models, e.g. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, while data on disease incidence as well as viral genetic and antigenic variation are increasing for many viruses, e.g. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , fitting and assessing phylodynamic models to these data is still not commonly done.",

These methods have been particularly useful to reconstruct epidemiological transmission histories, identifying when and where transmission occurred and how viral populations change over time. For example, coalescentbased analyses have highlighted the importance of the tropics in the complex circulation dynamics of human influenza A (H3N2) virus (in short: H3N2) [9, 21, 22] . However, most coalescent methods estimate past population dynamics within a class of flexible demographic functions including exponential and logistic growth as well as the nonparametric Bayesian skyride [23, 24] ; but see also [25] . These demographic functions do not explicitly describe the non-linear population dynamics of RNA viruses. Thus, assessing which ecological interactions underlie observed patterns of sequence diversity, and estimating the respective strength of these interactions, is difficult within this framework.",

We obtained weekly reports of H3N2 incidence in the Netherlands from 1994-2009 by combining influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data with detailed records of associated, laboratory-confirmed cases of flu by type and subtype [29, 30] , and similarly for France and the USA; see Figure 1 and the supplementary online material (Text S1). In addition, we reconstructed the ladder-like phylogeny of H3N2's haemagglutinin gene (HA) from dated European sequences collected in 1968-2009 (see Figure 1 and Text S1). To represent H3N2's global phylodynamics, we focus on a class of spatially structured phylodynamic compartmental models that formalize probabilistically how evolving, antigenic variants interact epidemiologically. These antigenic variants might correspond to the major antigenic clusters that are distinguishable in H3N2 antigenic maps [31] , but can in principle also represent a different phenotypic resolution. The evolutionary dynamics of viral genotypes are separately formulated for each antigenic phenotype because genetic distances do not necessarily easily translate into phenotypic relationships [5] . Spatial substructure has been incorporated in several models of H3N2 phylodynamics to reflect the global circulation of the virus [4, 8, 32] . We adopt here a simple source-sink framework, where the sink is thought of as the Netherlands into which viral genetic diversity and antigenic strains are imported on a seasonal scale from a source population where the virus persists [9, 33] . We fit and assess two distinct models to the combined features of sequence and incidence data described in Figure 1 and Table 1 . The first model captures H3N2's antigenic drift phenomenologically through gradual loss of immunity, and the second model describes the antigenic evolution of the virus explicitly with particular assumptions on the tempo of antigenic change.",

This interaction between evolutionary and ecological processes complicates our ability to understand the infectious disease behavior of rapidly evolving pathogens. Most statistical methods for the analysis of these ''phylodynamics'' require that the likelihood of the data can be explicitly calculated. Currently, this is not possible for many phylodynamic models, so that questions on the interaction between viral variants cannot be well-addressed within this framework. Simulation-based statistical methods circumvent likelihood calculations. Considering interpandemic human influenza A virus subtype H3N2, we here illustrate the effectiveness of these methods to fit and assess complex phylodynamic models against both sequence and surveillance data. We find that combining molecular genetic and epidemiological data is key to estimate phylodynamic parameters reliably. Moreover, the information in the available data taken together is enough to expose quantitative model inconsistencies. Methods such as ABC which can combine sequence and surveillance data appear to be well-suited to fit and assess mechanistic hypotheses on the phylodynamics of RNA viruses. *Distances between summaries derived from the first listed and subsequent data sets are given in brackets.",

To use this detailed information on each summary, we prefer using (2) to the Mahanalobis approximation (see [26] ). Although uncommon, we typically use the log ratio r k (S k (x),S k (y))l og (S k (x)=S k (y)) so that the errors e k can be uniformly interpreted as fold-deviations. Parameter inference using ABC is approximate in that the ABC target density p t (hDx)!' t (xDh) p(h) approaches the posterior density (1) as t tends to zero if the summaries are sufficient for h [26] . We use a Monte Carlo algorithm that is very similar to the MCMC sampler in Figure 2 . A full specification of the algorithm is given in Text S1. It is typically difficult to establish the sufficiency of phylodynamic summaries analytically, and instead a small set of summaries is chosen such that model parameters of interest can be estimated [26] . Table 1 lists basic features of H3N2 epidemiological and phylogenetic data that were primarily considered in this study. Phylodynamic models were fitted and assessed against the features of the Dutch incidence data and the viral phylogeny derived under the Exponential clock model. The differences between these summaries and those derived from the remaining data in Figure 1 were used to set the ABC tolerances large enough so that inference is robust to the choice of phylogenetic reconstruction method and reporting country. Although smaller tolerances can be computationally feasible, these were not supported by the additional data considered. We typically use the Indicator weighting scheme (3) with tolerances t k that encompass differences in summary values across reporting countries and/or reconstruction methods, see Table 1 . When a model never fits a particular summary well, we use (4) to give a mild prior preference to small errors [27] . See Text S1 for further details. Overview of simulation-based phylodynamic inference and model assessment. Phylodynamic hypotheses are formulated into evolving, dynamical systems models. We used a two-tier model formulation whose genetic component is tied to its ecological component through the flows through the prevalence class. Existing knowledge on model parameters is incorporated through the prior p(h), and Monte Carlo algorithms such as MCMC are used to fit the model to different types of data, e.g. incidence time series and reconstructed phylogenies (see Figure 1 ) with an ABC approach. ABC is based on likelihood approximations such as (2) , which requires a specification of phylodynamic summaries (e.g. Table 1 ). The summary errors are used to diagnose if the fitted phylodynamic model is consistent with available data in terms of the specified summaries. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002835.g002 Spatial two-tier models to represent H3N2 phylodynamics Deterministic skeleton. ABC methods require that each phylodynamic simulation must run on the order of tens of seconds. To meet this computational requirement while still allowing for flexible modeling [6, 35] , we adopt a two-tier approach that separates the genotypes of rapidly evolving viruses from their antigenic phenotypes [7] . The underlying rationale is that differences in genotype are only relevant from a population dynamic perspective if they translate into perceivable phenotypic differences. The first tier describes the dynamic interactions of antigenic variants in the host population, here in terms of coupled susceptible-exposed-infectedrecovered-susceptible (SEIRS) equations that are further spatially structured into a strongly seasonally forced sink population and a reseeding, weakly seasonally forced source population (denoted by ; and respectively). The second tier simulates a phylogeny that is consistent with the prevalence and incidence dynamics of each antigenic unit in the first tier. Assuming polarized immunity [3] , the deterministic skeleton for the ith antigenic unit is",

The total number of infections and losses I z i and I { i are the simulated transitions in and out of I i at time t, so that (5c-5d) are tied to (5a-5b). New genotypes evolve at a rate f, and a genealogy of the ith antigenic unit is generated by recording the emergence times of each genotype along with their kinships. The branch length between offspring and parental genotype is always one. After extinct genotypes are pruned, the branch length between two genotypes gives the number of nucleotide substitutions between them. These genealogies are concatenated by connecting the root genotype with a genotype of the parental antigenic unit that is randomly drawn according to genotype frequencies at time t e i . The residual selection parameter s accounts phenomenologically for selection pressures between genetic variants that are evident from the shape of the virus phylogeny, but remain unexplained by a particular ecological model of antigenic variants (5a-5b). Once the distribution of s has been inferred from population incidence and genetic data, we can then quantify how well a phylodynamic model describes patterns of continual immune selection mechanistically, and also compare alternative phylodynamic models in this respect.",

The behavior of the spatial SEIRS model, when fitted to the case report and phylogenetic summaries in Table 1 , is illustrated in Figure 3 with parameter estimates given in Table 2 . On real data, the summary errors were considerably larger than on simulated data, so that the t sim k could not be used. Instead, we chose ABC tolerances with a data-driven approach that compares summary errors across different empirical data sets (see the Methods section and Table 1 ). Overall, we can simultaneously infer the epidemiological and evolutionary parameters R 0 , 1=c, r, i s , s, f, N . As shown in Figure 3A , the MCMC algorithm may get occasionally stuck in the tails of the target density (see Text S1 for further discussion). The posterior mean and standard deviation of R 0 , 3:03+0:55, are relatively large in comparison to estimates from previous studies [36, [38] [39] [40] , and R 0 is positively correlated with the average duration of infection 1=c to yield realistic incidence time series. We back-calculated the effective reproductive number R eff from the prevalence growth rate at the beginning of each season (see Text S1), and find that many combinations of R 0 and 1=c give a tight mean posterior R eff~1 :26+0:05 in agreement with these studies. In the absence of any ecological mechanisms inducing strain competition, the mean residual selection parameter is large s~0:1+0:16 and always included in the SEIRS model. Generally, the sequence divergence imposes negative correlations between f, s ( Figure 3E ) and f, N ( Figure 3F ), and the posterior mean mutation rate f~1:32+0:3/genome/year is much smaller than H3N2's substitution rate, 5.3-6.1/genome/year, when selection is incorporated into the model. Figure 4 illustrates that the fraction of susceptible individuals ranges within 15-40% and changes smoothly under seasonal forcing, thus leading to sustained oscillations in disease incidence. We failed to estimate m ; , Q ; , Q , m and recovered distributions close to the prior. Our prior assumptions are summarised in Table 2 and more fully discussed in Text S1.",

The extent to which phylodynamic parameters can be estimated depends mainly on the type of information that underlies the ABC summaries.

Detailed studies of closely monitored populations and serological data suggest interpandemic seasonal H3N2 attack rates between 10-20% in temperate regions [2] , and we found that conditioning on a broad window of maximum seasonal population incidence attack rates (pop-attack) between 15-30% ensures that key epidemiological parameters can be well estimated ( Figure S4 in Text S1).",

We can use the number of lineages despite their dependence on sampling effort because with ABC, we are free to sample simulated sequences exactly as in the observed data set, see the Methods section. Finally, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) links the evolutionary dynamics with the ecological interactions between antigenically distinct viral variants because weak selective advantages invariably lead to coexistence and deep phylogenies in the face of high f and weak Q.

In the absence of strong seasonal forcing in the source population, infrequent cluster invasions often excite large invasion waves and refractory oscillations [32] , as well as pronounced genetic bottlenecks that are inconsistent with the HA phylogeny, see Figure 6 . More importantly, when the epochal evolution model is fitted to H3N2's narrow phylogeny, ABC reveals that aspects of disease incidence cannot be quantitatively reproduced at the same time. In particular, the estimated average duration of intra-cluster immunity is 1=c~205+100 years, which in turn implies a mean posterior R 0 of 19+5 in order to reproduce H3N2's explosiveness; see Figures 5G,H. The effect of such high values of R 0 is hard to discern on interpandemic case report data without much stronger assumptions on the reporting rate than in this study. However, an R 0 around 20 implies long term population level attack rates well below 10%, which is not compatible with epidemiological estimates (see Figure 5L and [2] ). To match aspects of H3N2's HA phylogeny, unrealistically low pop-attack rates are further compensated by high N ~2:9|10 8 +1:6|10 8 . If strong seasonal forcing is assumed in the source population (Q w0:15 but see [42] ), the epochal evolution model produces a much better fit in line with previous work [7] (see Text S1).",

Figures 3  and 5 illustrate that the resulting dimension reduction regularizes the underlying, intractable likelihood into a smooth, yet welldefined surface such that key phylodynamic model parameters are identifieable and goodness-of-fit can be characterized. It remains unclear to what degree the use of sufficient statistics or the full historical data would be desirable. Indeed, when infectious pathogens escape immunity, the likelihood surface can be especially complex [18, 43] .

Here, the mechanistic structure of Eqns. (5) constrains the set of possible phylodynamic trajectories in such a way that influenza's global disease dynamics must be explicitly accounted for.

One possible explanation is that localized extinctions may not occur sufficiently often under the re-seeding source-sink framework, suggesting that models with more detailed population structure, either in space or by age, may result in thinner phylogenies. Accounting for these types of population structure can be critical for understanding viral phylodynamics; here we showed that the fit of the epochal evolution model to both sequence and incidence data depends critically on the assumed spatial model structure and the associated Q (see Text S1).",

If the fitted values of 1=c and R 0 are correlated, this in turn implies a characteristic range of population level attack rates that can be tested against available data as in Figure 5L . In particular, the duration of immunity can be lower if the time between replacement events is shorter.

More frequent and more gradual transitions between antigenic variants that are smaller than H3N2's antigenic clusters would allow for lower estimates of R 0 that are more in line with observed population level attack rates, break weaker refractory oscillations in their onset, and might also provide sufficient, continual selection pressures to explain the fast divergence in H3N2's HA phylogeny [8] . In this case, sequence and surveillance data would point to a finer antigenic resolution than the one suggested through antigenic map analyses [31] .

ABC is based on likelihood approximations such as (2), which requires a specification of phylodynamic summaries (e.g. Table 1).
