Depending on the host and virus virulence, MDV can cause more than 90% morbidity and mortality in susceptible chickens 1 . Chickens become infected by MDV following inhalation of infected dust via the respiratory route. MDV primarily infects macrophages, B and T cells and it mainly transforms CD4+ T cells although other T cell subtypes are susceptible to transformation 2,3 . Generally, MDV life cycle can be divided into the cytolytic phase (2-7 days post-infection -dpi), latent phase (7-10 dpi), late cytolytic phase, and transformation phase 2 . Lysis of lymphocytes and activation of TGF-beta + regulatory T cells are a few mechanisms among others which induce immunosuppression during MDV infection 4 . Furthermore, transformed T cells proliferate form lymphoma which can lead to immunosuppression and clinical and pathological signs of disease. In the course of infection, MDV replicates in feather follicular epithelium and sheds into the environment throughout the lifespan of an infected chicken.",

However, protection offered by HVT is inadequate especially against very virulent and very virulent plus pathotypes of MDV 7 . Moreover, this vaccine will not be protective against emerging highly virulent strains of MDV in the future. Therefore, it would be of interest to determine whether efficacy of HVT can be enhanced by addition of immune stimulants. Innate and adaptive defense mechanisms are necessary to control MDV infection in chickens. In young chicks, it is likely that in ovo administered vaccines initially confer protection mainly via innate immune system cells including Natural Killer (NK) like cells and macrophages rather than adaptive immune responses [8] [9] [10] [11] . In general, the activation of innate responses orchestrates the induction of adaptive responses which in turn require several days to provide protective immunity against an infection. However, this is not well understood in regard to MD vaccination. In general, the immune system in young chicks undergoes maturation and becomes functionally mature around 1-2 weeks of age. Therefore, the induction of adaptive immune responses might be limited in the early stage of life and immediately after hatching. It has been reported that chicken T cells exhibit poor responsiveness to mitogen stimulation and are functionally immature during the first 2 weeks of age 12 . In addition, although it has been shown that chickens start to mount antibody-mediated immune responses at 1 week of age, they usually display higher levels of antibody production when they are immunized around 2 weeks of age 13, 14 .",

As a result, these responses can be exploited to accelerate the maturation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Increased IFN-\u03b3 expression observed with in ovo HVT vaccination in chickens 16 as well as increased NK like activity observed with HVT vaccination at hatch and post-hatch 17, 18 revealed that innate responses can be elevated to significant level with appropriate immune modulations 19 .

In HVT only group (G4), 53.33% of the chickens exhibited tumors, which was significantly different compared to positive control chickens Figure 1 . Presence of tumors in different treatment groups. Experimental groups were as follows: G1-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18 and the second dose of ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G2-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18. G3-HVT was administered at ED18 and ECpG was given at 14 dpi. G4-HVT was administered at ED18. G5-ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G6-Untreated, MDV-infected group. G7-PBS control group. Chickens in all groups were infected with MDV at d5 except G7. Presence of tumors was recorded at 21 dpi. Data were statistically analyzed by Fisher's exact test in GraphPad Prism 6.04. p \u2264 0.05 (*) was considered statistically significant compared to G6. (p = 0.01, Fig. 1 ). In G3 and G5, 72.72% and 90% of the chickens developed tumors respectively (Fig. 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor incidence between chickens in G4 and ECpG administered groups (G1, G2 and G3). However, the highest reduction in tumor incidence was observed in chickens in G2 (Fig. 1) . Therefore, it seems that ECpG partially improved the HVT induced protection against MD.",

Among the HVT-administered groups, a significant reduction in both tumor incidence and MDV load in feathers was observed in G2 and G4 chickens. Chickens in G1 showed significant reduction only in tumors whereas chickens in G3 showed significant reduction only in MDV load in feathers. Although there was no statistically significant difference in tumor incidence between chickens in G4 and groups receiving ECpG (G1, G2 and G3), administration of ECpG along with HVT at ED18 appeared to have an additive effect to HVT vaccination, marked by the lowest tumor incidence in G2 chickens. The observed reduction of MDV load in feathers of chickens treated with ECpG and HVT or HVT alone is similar to the reduction reported in a previous study using Rispens-CVI988 vaccine 30 , which is known to be the most effective vaccine against very virulent and very virulent plus MDV 31 . Since a reduction of MDV load in feathers was observed in the current study, further investigation of MDV transmission pattern in the environment especially in the dust and between chickens will answer whether this reduction interrupts the spread of MDV. Particularly, the use of resistant and susceptible genotypes of chickens may validate the use of ECpG with HVT as the virulence of MDV can be masked in resistant line of chickens 32 .",

Hence, organ weight indices were recorded to evaluate the changes occurring in BF and spleen following different treatments and MDV challenge in chickens. Administration of either ECpG and HVT or HVT alone possibly inhibited the initial cytolysis of B cells in BF as indicated by the BF:BW ratios similar to those of the control group. The observed abrogation of bursal atrophy is similar to the previous reports 33, 34 . HVT administration with or without ECpG might have resolved the physiological changes which occurred in spleen at the initial stage of MDV infection since there was no difference in the ratios of The different experimental groups were: G1-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18 and the second dose of ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G2-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18. G3-HVT was administered at ED18 and ECpG was given at 14 dpi. G4-HVT was administered at ED18. G5-ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G6-Untreated, MDV-infected group. G7-PBS control group. Chickens in all groups were infected with MDV at d5 except G7. Data were logarithmically transformed and analyzed using general linear model (Proc GLM) and followed by Duncan's multiple range test in Statistical Analysis Software version 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used when data were not normally distributed. Gene expression results were presented as geometric mean of relative expression \u00b1 standard error of mean. p \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant when compared to G7 (*) or G6 (#) or G4 (\u03c6). spleen:BW between the chickens in HVT-administered group and uninfected group at 21 dpi. However, further investigation is needed to test this possibility. The significant upregulation of the cytokines, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, in BF at 4 dpi raises the possibility that the anti-viral activity of these cytokines might have repressed MDV replication at the initial stage of MDV pathogenesis and led to the reduction in tumor incidence and MDV load in feathers. Previous study indicated that involvement of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in preventing DNA and virion synthesis in the case of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection 35 . Since MDV and HSV belong to the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, we can speculate that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 may have similar functions for preventing the replication of MDV in infected cells. Another study also revealed that TLR-Ls induced IFN-\u03b2 expression provide protection against HSV2 infection 36 . These lines of evidence and our findings support the role played by IFN-\u03b2 induced by ECpG and HVT in immunity against MD in chickens. IFN-\u03b3 possibly exerts anti-viral effects on MDV-infected cells directly or indirectly via activation of macrophages 37 . Significant upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 at 4 dpi in BF in some treatment groups compared to G6 indicates initial anti-viral effects which might have contributed to the subsequent reduction of tumors in chickens. Overall, the expression profile of IFN-\u03b3 in spleen and BF shows the association of IFN-\u03b3 with immunity to MDV infection. This is in agreement with previous studies showing the importance of IFN-\u03b3 in HVT conferred immunity in chickens 38, 39 .",

It has been suggested that IL-10 curtails T helper (Th)1 immune responses, which are critical for protection, by deviating responses towards Th2 responses 40 . This could also be the case for MDV infection as an association between IL-10 expression and the disease was reported 41, 42 . IL-10 affects dendritic cell (DC) maturation by inhibition of costimulatory molecules, DC induced T cell activation, antigen-specific T cell proliferation and function 43, 44 ; and it promotes the expansion of inducible T regulatory cells 45 . Notably, the experimental groups in the current study that exhibited significant reduction in tumor incidence displayed lower expression of IL-10 in spleen at 21 dpi. In addition, chickens that had tumors, expressed elevated levels of IL-10 in spleen and BF compared to those chickens that did not have tumors in each treatment group (data not shown). A similar pattern of IL-10 expression was recorded in previous studies in a different context, for example when chickens were vaccinated with bivalent or Rispens-CVI988 vaccine followed by MDV infection 30, 41 . Therefore, previous reports were further confirmed and extended in the current study as the suppression of IL-10 was inversely associated with protection.",

It has been noted previously that expression of IL-18 diminished in MD resistant lines of chickens 46 compared to that of susceptible lines and also in vaccine protected chickens compared to unvaccinated-infected controls 39, 41 . Similar observations were confirmed in the current study as indicated by the association between decreased expression of IL-18 and protection against MDV as shown by the reduction of tumor incidence and MDV load in feathers. Moreover, IL-18 supports the metastasis of melanoma cells via elevated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) 47 .

The untreated, but MDV-infected group was used as a positive control group. At 14 dpi, chickens were given a second dose of ECpG or PBS. Experimental groups in this study were designated as follows. Chickens in group 1 (G1) received ECpG and HVT at ED18, infected with MDV at day 5 (d5) and received a second dose of ECpG at 14 dpi. Group 2 (G2) chickens were administered with ECpG and HVT at ED18 and infected with MDV at d5. Chickens in group 3 (G3) were injected with HVT at ED18, infected with MDV at d5 and administered ECpG at 14 dpi. Group 4 (G4) chickens were administered with HVT at ED18 and infected with MDV at d5. Group 5 (G5) chickens received MDV at d5 and ECpG at 14 dpi. Group 6 (G6) chickens received MDV at d5. Chickens in group 7 (G7) received PBS. Each group had between 9-15 chickens at different time points. At 4, 10 and 21 dpi, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius weight (BF), and body weight (BW) were recorded and organ weight indices were calculated relative to the body weight of chickens. Samples from spleen, BF and feathers were collected in RNAlater and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. Tumor incidence following infection with RB1B MDV was documented at 21 dpi.",
