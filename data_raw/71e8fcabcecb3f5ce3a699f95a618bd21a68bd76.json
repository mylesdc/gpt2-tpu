However, the potential utility of surfactin as an antiviral drug is limited by its cytotoxicity. In this study, 10 surfactin analogues were obtained by chemical synthesis and evaluated to determine their anti-PEDV activities, hemolytic activities, and critical micelle concentrations. The main goal of our study was to develop a safer drug; a surfactin analogue with high anti-PEDV activity and low hemolytic activity. Compared with surfactin, one of the analogues we developed, SLP5, has lower hemolytic activity, with the same antiviral activity. The selectivity index of SLP5 is 52, while the SI for surfactin is 4, in other words, the safe and effective concentration range of SLP5 is 12 times greater than that of surfactin. Like surfactin, SLP5 has a direct antiviral effect on PEDV. Structurally, SLP5 is a linear lipopeptide with three carboxyl groups. Surfactin derivatives similar to SLP5 could be obtained by lactone bond hydrolyzation of surfactin, as well as total synthesis.",

We recently demonstrated that surfactin exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral membrane fusion [3] . Membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane is essential for enveloped viruses to invade host cells. Surfactin can act directly on virus particles by insertion into the viral envelopes' lipid bilayer and thereby reduce the membrane fusion rate. In addition, since the lipid components of viral envelopes are provided by the host cell, their composition, structure, and function are widely similar in the enveloped viruses. Surfactin has antiviral activity against numerous enveloped viruses, and it has promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral reagent, however, the effective dose range of surfactin is narrow, merely 4 x the antiviral concentration causes hemolysis and cytotoxicity. In this study we compared chemically synthesized surfactin analogues to determine future directions for surfactin modification. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

The production of designer surfactins, made by changing the number and composition of amino acids and fatty acids has proven to be an effective strategy for screening large numbers of lipopeptides for biological activity, but most current research focuses on their anticancer [4] , antimicrobial [5] and insulin delivery [6] properties but not on their antiviral potential. Fatty acid chain length is critical to the antimicrobial effect of synthetic polymyxin analogues [7] , while the specific antimicrobial spectrum of these analogues depends the amino acids in the lipopeptide [8] . Additionally, in synthetic daptomycin analogues, the introduction of aromatic groups in the fatty acid moiety also affects antibacterial activity [9] . In this study, a series of similar lipopeptides were designed and synthesized using surfactin as a template. These analogues differ from each other in the number of hydrophobic amino acids, number of hydrophilic groups, charge properties, amino acid chirality, position of hydrophilic amino acids, and aromatic groups in the fatty chain.",

Those of SLP1, SLP2, SLP3, and surfactin are similar, suggesting that the number of hydrophobic amino acids has little effect on hemolytic activity. However, other modifications significantly affect activity; SLP4, SLP3 and SLP5 have one, two and three carboxyl groups respectively, and the hemolytic activity is reduced in turn. In addition, the chiral differences that distinguish SLP7 and SLP3 at two amino acid residues, and the differences in the arrangement of amino acids between SLP8 and SLP9 also affect hemolytic activity. These results indicate that amino acid composition by itself does not completely determine the characteristics of SLPs. It is noteworthy that SLP8 has an unexpected effect on porcine erythrocytes. Although SLP8 has a low hemolytic activity, it prevents the precipitation of red bloods under our assay conditions at concentrations above 50 \u03bcg/ml. The selectivity index (SI) was determined as the ratio of the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) to the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ). As shown in Table 2 , SLP8 and SLP5 have the highest and second-highest SI values respectively. Given the anti-sedimentation effect of SLP8 on porcine blood cells, SLP5 was selected as the most promising candidate. Although SLP4 and SLP6 have stronger antiviral activity than surfactin, their SI is lower due to their high hemolytic activity.",

Time of addition assays were performed to determine whether the SLP5 exerts its anti-PEDV effect at the same stage during infection as surfactin. Since surfactin acts directly on virions, the experiment was designed to examine events early in the infection process. Fig 6A summarizes the experimental plan and the eight treatments tested. Briefly, SLP5, surfactin, or DEPE was added to virus alone, cells alone, or to cells and virus together prior to infection, during virus adsorption, during virus invasion (1 h post infection at 37\u02daC), or during replication (1-12 hpi). Samples were harvested 12 hours after infection, and analyzed to measure cellular levels of viral protein (Fig 6B and 6C ) and viral RNA ( Fig 6D) . As expected for a normal component of the cell membrane, DEPE did not affect PEDV replication at any stage, while SLP5 and surfactin exhibited antiviral activity at specific stages. For example, when SLP5 or surfactin are present throughout the experiment (treatment group 2), little PEDV replication occurs, as indicated by nucleic acid and protein levels. The same is true in treatment group 5, indicating that both compounds act directly on the virus. Other antiviral mechanisms of SLP5 and surfactin cannot be ruled out since PEDV replication is inhibited to different degrees in some of the other treatment groups.",

Compared with surfactin, the structure of SLP5 is distinguished by its linear lipopeptide and the additional carboxyl group at the C' of the peptide. SLP5 also has two fewer hydrophobic amino acids than surfactin, this reduces the cost of synthesis while having little effect on antiviral activity. Since surfactin has been shown to protect piglets from PEDV challenge [3] , the in vivo antiviral properties of surfactin analogues needs to be tested. Furthermore, with respect to the future use of synthetic surfactins to control or ameliorate infection in pigs, the broader spectrum physiological activities of surfactin analogues needs further study and side effects beyond hemolytic toxicity need to be explored. Our study suggests that SLP5, and other surfactin analogues, should be the object of in-depth study in order to develop a safer broad-spectrum family of surfactin antiviral agents.
