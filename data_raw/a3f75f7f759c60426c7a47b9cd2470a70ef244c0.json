In this study, we showed that the overexpression of nsp11 of PRRSV induced a strong suppression of IFN production. Nsp11 suppressed both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activities when stimulated with a dsRNA analogue and TNF-\u03b1, respectively. This suppression was RLR dependent, since the transcripts and proteins of MAVS and RIG-I, two critical factors in RLR-mediated pathway, were both found to be reduced in the presence of overexpressed nsp11. Since nsp11 is an endoribonuclease (EndoU), the structure function relationship was examined using a series of nsp11 EndoU mutant plasmids. The mutants that impaired the EndoU activity failed to suppress IFN and led to the normal expression of MAVS. Seven single amino acid substitutions (4 in subdomain A and 3 in subdomain B) plus one insertion (frame-shift in nsp11) were then introduced into PRRSV infectious cDNA clones to generate nsp11 mutant viruses. Unfortunately, all EndoU knock-out nsp11 mutant viruses appeared replication-defective and no progenies were produced. Three mutations in EndoU subdomain A expressed the N and nsp2/3 proteins but their infectivity diminished after 2 passages. Taken together, our data show that PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease activity is critical for both viral replication and IFN antagonism. More importantly, the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 demonstrates the substrate specificity towards MAVS and RIG-I (transcripts and proteins) over p65 and IRF3 in the context of gene transfection and overexpression. This is likely a mechanism of nsp11 suppression of type I IFN production.",

For RNA viruses, the viral genome is first recognized by specific receptors including toll-like receptor 3/ 7 (TLR-3/7) and cytosolic receptors. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are the well-known sensors in the cytoplasm, and their activations will recruit TANK-binding protein-1/I-\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (TBK-1/IKK\u03b5) and TGF\u03b2-activated kinase-1 (TAK-1) to mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (MAVS; also named VISA, IPS-1), resulting in the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and subunits of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB [4] [5] [6] . Activated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB are then translocated to the nucleus and form a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome along with cAMP response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and other transcription factors, leading to the expression of type I IFN genes [7] .",

PRRS has since quickly spread globally and has become one of the most economically significant diseases to the pork industry worldwide. The causative agent is the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the family Arteriviridae that forms the order Nidovirales along with two other families, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae. The PRRSV genome is a single-strand positive-sense RNA containing 10 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3 up to ORF7, plus the newly identified ORF5a [10, 11] . PRRS affects breeding herd and grower/finisher pigs, manifesting reproductive problems including abortions and foetal deaths in sow, increased mortality in neonates, and respiratory problems in young pigs. PRRSV infection causes the suppression of type IFN induction in alveolar macrophages and in lungs of pigs where PRRSV actively replicates [12, 13] . Several viral proteins in PRRSV have been shown to downregulate IFN production, including nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and N [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Among them, nsp11 is the only one harboring RNA nuclease activity. Although its IFN antagonism has been previously reported (including by our lab) and its crystal structure has been recently solved, the mechanism of how it inhibits type I IFN production remains unknown [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

It is a 223 amino acids protein containing a highly conserved EndoU domain unique for viruses in the order Nidovirales. The EndoU domain resides in the C-terminal region in PRRSV nsp11 and shows a distant relationship with the XendoU family. XendoU is an endoribonuclease derived from Xenopus laevis [26] [27] [28] . PRRSV nsp11 has the uridylatepreference cleavage of RNA and consists of two subdomains, subdomain A and subdomain B. Subdomain A is thought to maintain the nuclease activity while subdomain B may be important for overall structural conformation. From its newly determined crystal structure, nsp11 assembles into an asymmetric dimmer [22] , which differs from the hexametric structure of coronaviruses nsp15 [29, 30] . However, enzymatic sites of PRRSV nsp11 are perfectly superimposed on coronavirus nsp15 with two His residues in the \"active loop\" and one Val residue and one Thr residue in the \"supportive loop\" [31] [32] [33] [34] . In addition, nsp11 in equine arteritis virus (EAV), which structurally mimics PRRSV nsp11, is reported to be essential for viral replication [35] .",

Specifically, the protein and mRNA level of both MAVS and RIG-I, but not p65 and IRF3, were reduced when exposed to the overexpressed nsp11 in cells, arguing its limited restriction of targets. The transfection of nsp11 mutants that lost the EndoU activity was unable to reduce MAVS mRNA and exhibited normal IFN production. Unfortunately, EndoU knock-out mutant genomic clones were unable to generate infectious progeny. However, we observed the reduced expression of both RIG-I and MAVS during WT PRRSV infection, suggesting nsp11 may preserve the same function during viral infection. Taken together, our data show that the PRRSV EndoU activity plays an essential role for viral replication and participates in innate immune modulation.",

PRRSV nsp11 contains an IFN promoter suppressive activity but its molecular action is unknown [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] . To study this function of nsp11, MARC-145 cells were transfected with nsp11, which was Flag-tagged at the N-terminus, and the pIFN-\u03b2-luc, pIRF3-luc, or pPRDII-luc reporter plasmids followed by transfection with poly(I:C) for IFN stimulation (Fig 1A) . pIRF3-luc and pPRDII-luc contain 4 copies of the IRF3 binding sequence or 2 copies of the NF-\u03baB binding sequence located in the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, respectively, in front of the luciferase reporter gene. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was derived from the parasitic helminth Schistosoma japonicum, and is frequently used as a tag for detection of a protein and thus was used as a negative control in this study. While cells transfected with the empty vector (control) and non-related gene GST showed high induction of IFN activity, nsp11-expressing cells exhibited strong suppression of IFN-\u03b2, IRF3, and NF-\u03baB activities. As the amount of nsp11 was increased, the suppression became stronger, suggesting that this activity was dose-dependent and that the suppression was through the inhibition of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB promoter activities. To confirm the reporter assays, an IFN bioassay was conducted using vesicular stomatitis virus expressing GFP (VSV-GFP). VSV is highly sensitive to IFN, and thus secretion of IFN in the culture supernatant can be determined by monitoring the intensity of green fluorescence during VSV replication [40] . Culture supernatants collected from nsp11-transfected HeLa cells were serially diluted by 2-folds and each diluted supernatant was then incubated with MARC-145 cells in 96-well plates, followed by infection with VSV-GFP. Poly(I:C) transfection at 0.5 \u03bcg per well in a 6-well plate stimulated the secretion of IFN to culture supernatants of cells and thus a negligible level of fluorescence was seen at 1:64 dilution of culture supernatant (Fig 1B, middle panels). In contrast, GFP expression was readily observed in cells expressing nsp11 at 1:16 dilution even after poly(I:C) stimulation ( Fig 1B, bottom panel) , indicating a minor amount of IFN in nsp11-overexpressing cells. These results show that nsp11 has the ability to suppress the IFN-\u03b2 production pathway.",

IRF3 normally resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. But upon stimulation, it undergoes phosphorylation, dimerization, and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Thus, sub-cellular localization of IRF3 was first examined in nsp11-expressing cells. Poly(I:C) transfection caused IRF3 nuclear translocation as anticipated, whereas in nsp11-expressing cells, IRF3 was not detected in the nucleus (Fig 2A, top panel, lane 2, 3). Nsp11 expression was detected only in the cell cytoplasm using Flag antibody. This observation was confirmed by immunofluorescence of IRF3 (S1 Fig). Since IRF3 did not undergo nuclear translocation in nsp11-expressing cells, its phosphorylation state was examined. When stimulated with poly(I:C), IRF3 was effectively phosphorylated in control but was reduced in nsp11-expressing cells. This reduction was not due to the change in total amounts of IRF3 ( Fig 2B, lanes 1, 2, 3, 4) , indicating that the suppression of IFN induction by nsp11 was due to the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation.",

One readout of NF-\u03baB activation is p65 nuclear translocation. Therefore, we first examined the localization of p65 in the presence of transfected nsp11. The p65 subunit was normally translocated to the nucleus in control cells after stimulation (S2 Fig, bottom panel, yellow arrow) . In sharp contrast, its nuclear translocation was inhibited in nsp11 overexpressing cells (S2 Fig, bottom panel, white arrows), suggesting that nsp11 blocks the p65 nuclear localization. In order for .05 \u03bcg of pRL-TK, an indicated amount of nsp11, or 0.5 \u03bcg of GST along with 0.5 \u03bcg of pIFN-\u03b2-luc, p4xIRF3-luc, or p(PRDII) 2 -luc. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were transfected with poly(I:C) (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) for 16 h, and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system according to the instructions (Promega). The reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene placed under the target gene promoter and the Renilla luciferase vector, referred to as pRL-TK, were co-transfected into cells. The Renilla plasmid served as an internal control to normalize the experimental variability including transfection efficiencies, different numbers of cells, loading differences, and cell lysis efficiency. Cell lysates were prepared and the firefly luciferase activity was first determined (number \"a\"). This reaction was quenched and the renilla luciferase activity was measured (number \"b\"). Relative luciferase activity was then calculated by a ratio of a/b. In Fig 1A, the relative luciferase activity was only normalized with the internal Renilla control. The basal level in MARC-145 cells was considered to be the ratio in samples transfected with the vector control. The experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated three times for statistical analysis. Each sample from nsp11-transfected cells was compared to poly(I:C) stimulation (*, P<0.05; **, P<0.01 analyzed by one-way ANOVA and bonferroni multiple comparison). (B) Suppression of IFN-\u03b2 production by PRRSV nsp11 as determined by IFN bioassay using VSV-GFP. The nsp11-gene was transfected into HeLa cells for 24 h to allow its expression, followed by either mock-or poly(I:C)-transfection. Cell culture supernatants were collected 8 h after poly(I:C) transfection and were diluted in PBS to make two-fold serial dilutions. MARC-145 cells were freshly grown in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h with each dilution of the culture supernatants, followed by infection with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. Cells were further incubated for 16 h and the GFP expression were visualized under microscope. p65 to go to the nucleus, I\u03baB needs to be phosphorylated and degraded, leading to the release of p65. We thus examined I\u03baB phosphorylation in nsp11-expressing cells. When stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 in control cells, phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was detectable at 5 min of stimulation ( Fig  2C, top panel, lane 2) and degraded shortly after. By 20 min, phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was virtually undetectable, which was due to rapid degradation. In nsp11-transfected cells however, phosphorylated I\u03baB was less abundant than in control cells, especially at 5 min of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation ( Fig 2C, top panel, lane 6) , indicating the inhibition of I\u03baB phosphorylation by nsp11 overexpression.",

Cells were lysed at indicated time points and each lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot using \u03b1-nsp11 PAb, \u03b1-\u03b2-actin MAb, \u03b1-phosphor-I\u03baB \u03b1PAb, or \u03b1-p65 PAb. the IFN activity was inhibited significantly and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Similarly, in cells overexpressing MAVS by transfection with pFlag-MAVS plasmids, the luciferase activity was increased up to 80 folds (Fig 2E) , whereas in cells co-expressing nsp11, this activity was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. When cells were co-transfected with the basal level promoter plasmid pTATA-Luc and nsp11, the luciferase activities remained at a basal level even when stimulated with each of the four inducers RIG-I, MAVS, poly(I:C), and IRF3 (S3 Fig), indicating the specific stimulation for IFN promoter. Taken together, nsp11 inhibits the RLR-mediated signaling and antagonizes IFN expression.",

MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with MAVS and nsp11, and total RNA and cellular lysates were individually prepared for quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Note that the endogenous MAVS was detected using MAVS specific antibodies (Abs), and the transfected MAVS and nsp11 were detected using Flag Abs since both MAVS and nsp11 plasmids contained Flag tag after the corresponding genes. Strikingly, exogenous MAVS protein was not detectable by Flag Abs in nsp11-expressing cells (Fig 3A) , and both endogenous and exogenous MAVS mRNAs were significantly reduced in these cells ( Fig 3B and S4A Fig) , suggesting that nsp11 impaired the MAVS function by dampening its mRNA. Note the weak bands above nsp11 in Fig Since the level of MAVS mRNA was decreased by nsp11, it was of interest to determine whether the reduction of MAVS was specific. To do this, MARC-145 cells were transfected with nsp11 alone and mRNA/protein of MAVS, RIG-I, p65, and IRF3 were individually examined by qRT-PC/western blot. Interestingly, RIG-I mRNA was found to be significantly reduced in addition to MAVS mRNA, whereas p65 mRNA and IRF3 mRNA remained relatively unchanged (Fig 3F) . Similar trend was observed for protein as well ( Fig 3G) . We conducted a similar experiment during PRRSV infection, and obtained a similar finding that the protein levels of MAVS and RIG-I, but not p65 and IRF3, were significantly reduced ( Fig 3H  and 3I ). This suggests that nsp11 does not target the host transcriptome globally. So far we identified MAVS and RIG-I as the two substrates of nsp11 to antagonize type I IFN production. For qPCR, cDNA were synthesized using random primers followed by qPCR using the MAVS, RIG-I, p65, and IRF3 specific primers. MAVS mRNA fold changes were calculated based on the copy numbers in nsp11-transfected cell relative to those of mock-transfected cell control. All gene copy numbers was relative to the housing keeping gene GAPDH. (n = 3, *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01, determined by 2 tailed t-test) (F, H). For protein, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot for MAVS, RIG-I, p65, IRF3, \u03b2-actin, and PRRSV nsp11 (G, I).",

Since EndoU of EAV nsp11 is closely related to PRRSV nsp11, all our mutations was made based on the previous study on EAV nsp11 and the newly released PRRSV nsp11 crystal structure. Specifically the double mutations of H2963A and H2978A or single mutation of H3007A in EAV nsp11 subdomain A reduced the cleavage of RNA to undetectable levels [35] . Moreover, D3014 and D3038 in EAV nsp11 subdomain B were shown to be critical for both genomic and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis [35] , and those mutations rendered the mutant nsp11 proteins insoluble [41] . These findings were confirmed for the SARS-CoV nsp15 protein [30, 41] . The two Asp (D) residues took part of an extensive hydrogen-bond network in the close proximity to the active site and thus replacing those residues might have caused an indirect effect on the nsp11 activity by disturbing its secondary structure. As mentioned earlier, PRRSV nsp11 enzymatic sites in subdomain A overlay with EAV and coronavirus nsp11 active sites [22] . Therefore, through alignment of EAV nsp11 and PRRSV nsp11s from North Americans strain and European strains, seven nsp11 mutants were constructed accordingly in which Ala mutations were introduced to the EndoU domain of PRRSV nsp11 as shown in Fig 4. Histidine substitutions at H3735, H3750, and K3779 in subdomain A of PRRSV nsp11, equivalent to H129, H144, and K173 indicated in nsp11 crystal structure, altered the EndoU catalytic sites. D3786 and D3810 in subdomain B, equivalent to D3014 and D3038 in EAV nsp11 and D180 and D204 in nsp11 crystal structure, were regarded to impair the secondary structure, and thus Ala mutations were introduced to these sites. Residues S2982 and S3030 did not affect any functional changes of the EndoU activity for EAV [35] , and thus equivalent mutations of S3754A and S3802A were made to PRRSV nsp11 to use as negative controls.",

            "text": "Cell cytotoxicity was of an initial concern during our study, since nsp11 is known to have cytotoxicity in some of the cell lines and it would be possible that the observation of IFN suppression could be the result of \"dying cells\" due to the cytotoxicity by ectopically over-expressing nsp11. Therefore, cell viability experiments were conducted using aqua Live/Dead staining followed by flow cytometry. The results indicated that nsp11 WT and mutant plasmids exhibited minimal and similar proportion of dead cells in the MARC-145 cell line (Fig 5A) , supporting that the IFN suppression by nsp11 was not due to the cell cytotoxicity. We then continued to examine the reduction of MAVS expression in cells overexpressing individual nsp11 mutants. Cells were co-transfected with Flagged MAVS and individual nsp11 mutants. Since MAVS was fused with Flag, anti-Flag antibody would only detect exogenous MAVS, while MAVS PAb would detect both exogenous and endogenous MAVSs in cells. As shown in Fig  5B, nsp11-S3754A and nsp11-S3802A which were not supposed to affect the EndoU activity showed the MAVS reduction as with nsp11-WT, and all other mutants did not change the level of MAVS. Interestingly, exogenous MAVS was not detectable by anti-Flag MAb in cells expressing nsp11-WT, nsp11-S3754A, and nsp11-S3802A (Fig 5B, lanes 2, 5, 8, top panel) , whereas low levels of endogenous MAVS was detectable when using MAVS PAb (Fig 5B, middle panel, lanes 2, 5, 8) . To further validate the reduction of endogenous MAVS, mRNA and protein levels were examined by qRT-PCR and IFA in nsp11-mutant expressing cells. For MAVS mRNA, the mutants with impaired EndoU activity showed normal levels of MAVS expression compared to empty vector control, except D3810A (Fig 5C) . D3810A was postulated to reduce MAVS likely by misfolding of the nsp11 protein. For MAVS protein, nsp11-K3779A was chosen as a representative mutant from the group of mutants that specifically lost the EndoU activity. By IFA, the MAVS signal was weak (blue arrows) in nsp11-WT expressing cells but strong (white arrows) in cells expressing nsp11-K3779A (Fig 5D, middle  and bottom panels) . It is noteworthy that nsp11 in gene-transfected cells was distributed throughout the cell (Fig 5D, more fields can be observed in S6 Fig) , while the distribution pattern was different in virus-infected cells (Fig 3E) . This is because in virus-infected cells, nsp11 interacts with other viral proteins to form a replication complex whereas in gene-transfected cells, nsp11 exists independently without association with other viral proteins. Regardless of its cellular distribution, the mutational studies indicate that the reduction of MAVS by nsp11 was dependent on the functional EndoU activity. ",

            "text": "To examine whether the EndoU-dependent MAVS reduction led to the suppression of IFN-\u03b2 production, nsp11 mutants were individually expressed in cells, and their ability to suppress IFN-\u03b2, IRF3, and NF-\u03baB was investigated using pIFN-\u03b2-luc, p4xIRF3-luc, and p(PRDII) 2 -luc, respectively. While nsp11-WT, nsp11-S3754A, and nsp11-S3802A exhibited stronger suppression, nsp11-H3735A and nsp11-H3750A showed a relatively minor suppression (Fig 6A, 6B and 6C). The EndoU mutants whose endoribonuclease activity was lost also showed the loss of IFN suppressive activity. IFN bioassays were conducted for individual mutants to confirm the results of the reporter assays, and consistent results with reporter assays were obtained (S5 Fig). We further examined the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB using nsp11-K3779A as a representative mutant from the group of mutants that lost the EndoU activity in Fig 5. In nsp11-WT expressing cells, phosphorylated IRF3 was not seen as anticipated but was normally detected in nsp11-K3779A expressing cells (Fig 2B, top panel, lanes 4 and 6) , indicating that the mutant nsp11-K3779A did not inhibit the IRF3 phosphorylation. For I\u03baB phosphorylation, I\u03baB MAb detected both phosphorylated (Fig 6D, top panel, upper bands) and unphosphorylated (lower bands) forms of I\u03baB. When stimulated with TNF-\u03b1, I\u03baB was rapidly degraded (Fig 6D, lane 2 , lower band), and it was likely due to its phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In nsp11-WT expressing cells however, a lesser amount of phosphorylated I\u03baB was identified ( Fig 6D, lane 6 compared to lane 2, upper band), whereas the total amount of I\u03baB was not decreased as fast as control (Fig 6D, lane 7 compared to lane 3, lower bands). This finding was consistent with the data obtained using phospho-I\u03baB PAb (Fig 2C) . In nsp11-K3779A expressing cells however, I\u03baB was normally phosphorylated as anticipated after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, and a lesser amount of I\u03baB was identified by 10 min post-stimulation (Fig 6D, lane 10 and 11) , indicating that the nsp11-K3779A mutant did not block the I\u03baB phosphorylation. Taken together, these results further support our findings that nsp11 antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 expression via the EndoU-mediated reduction of MAVS expression level. Note that these conclusions were made heavily based on the data from the overexpression system.",

A previous study suggested that EndoU-deficieny was not lethal for EAV but EndoU-deficient viruses were replication-compromised [35] . We constructed a series of EndoU mutant PRRSV genomic clones as indicated in Fig 4 using FL12 infectious cDNA clones. A stop-codon insertion mutant (Ins-mut) was additionally constructed to destroy the nsp11 gene and was used as a negative control. Cells were transfected with the full-length mutant genomic RNAs transcribed off their respective genomic clones, and PRRSV nsp2/3 and N proteins were examined by IFA at indicated times post-transfection ( Fig  7A) . To our surprise, two mutant genomes FL12-nsp11-D3786A and FL12-nsp11-D3810A did not express the nsp2/3 and N proteins in transfected-cells even after 72 h post-transfection (p.t.). Three mutant genomes FL12-nsp11-H3735A, FL12-nsp11-H3750A, and FL12-nsp11-K3779A showed a strong signal for nsp2/3 expression but a reduced signal for N protein compared to those of wild-type PRRSV at 16 h p.t.

The numbers of cells positive for nsp2/3 expression for FL12-nsp11-H3735A, FL12-nsp11-H3750A, and FL12-nsp11-K3779A were increased by approximately 10% at 24 h p.t. compared to those at 16 h p.t. As anticipated, FL12-nsp11-S3754A and FL12-nsp11-S3802A expressed the nsp2/3 and N proteins at comparable levels to those of wild-type PRRSV.",

            "text": "Viruses have developed various mechanisms during evolution to modulate the IFN response to evade the innate immune defense of hosts. For PRRSV, both North American and European genotypes have been shown to produce unusually low levels of type I IFNs during infection in cells and pigs [42] , and different isolates suppress varying degrees of IFNs [43] . VR-2332 and NVSL 97-7895 (FL12) strains in particular have been shown to possess a potent ability of IFN suppression. Viruses may carry more than one protein to modulate IFN response [44] [45] [46] , and for PRRSV, nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, and N proteins have been demonstrated to antagonize the NF-\u03baB or IFN pathways [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In the present study, we have further investigated nsp11-regulated IFN suppression and identified a mechanism interfering with the RLR mediated signaling by nsp11. PRRSV nsp11 inhibited the phosphorylation of both IRF3 and I\u03baB, and thus blocked their activation and nuclear translocation. It is intriguing that the mRNA of both RIG-I and MAVS, which is a critical adaptor within the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, was decreased by nsp11, and as a result, MAVS protein was significantly reduced. Furthermore, this reduction was EndoU-dependent as shown by mutational studies. H3735A, H3750A, and K3779A mutants, whose RNase catalytic sites were mutated, showed the loss of IFN suppression and normal level expression of MAVS. In the case of EAV nsp11, a double mutation of H3735A and H3750A caused the loss of RNase activity and it is postulated that the single mutation at one of the two residues may result in a partial RNase activity [41] . This may explain why H3735A and H3750A showed a partial suppression of IFN-\u03b2 activity. The aspartic acid at D3786 and D3810 may play a role in stabilizing the secondary structure of nsp11 as seen for nsp15 of SARS-CoV [30] , which is the PRRSV nsp11 homolog in coronaviruses. Thus, D3786A and D3810A mutant genes that lost their suppressive function may be due to an incorrect folding/assembly of the nsp11 complex. S3754A and S3802A retained the suppressive function for IFN-\u03b2 production and reduced MAVS mRNA as anticipated, as with wild-type nsp11. Taken together, our data, although majorly carried out in the context of transfection, showed that mRNAs of both RIG-I and MAVS were reduced by the nsp11 RNase activity, and therefore the RLR signaling failed to activating IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, leading to the suppression of type I IFN.",

            "text": "In fact, nsp11 is not the only viral protein in PRRSV targeting MAVS and RIG-I. A recent study reports that nsp4, a 3C-like viral proteinase, cleaves MAVS protein into small products and thus leads to the abolishment of IFN production [19] . A similar strategy is also utilized by hepatitis C virus [47] , and so it seems clear that many viruses often target not only proteins but also RNAs to counteract antiviral responses of hosts. The SARS-CoV nsp1 protein binds to the 40S ribosome to inactivate translation and also induces a template-dependent cleavage of mRNA [48] . The herpes simplex virus VHS protein degrades mRNA by its endoribonuclease activity and also affects translation by interacting with eIF4F [49, 50] . The influenza virus NS1 protein targets intracellular viral RNA and prevents binding to RIG-I and PKR, resulting in the inhibition of IRF3 activity [51] [52] [53] [54] . The E rns protein of bovine viral diarrhea virus is an exoribonuclease targeting extracellular RNAs, and the cleavage of RNA by E rns prevents the activation of TLR3 and blocks its downstream signaling [39] . Since PRRSV nsp11 is an endoribonuclease, the reduction of MAVS mRNA by nsp11 is postulated to be due to the mRNA degradation by endoribonuclease activity. In our study, nsp11 did not reduce the luciferase activity of the control plasmid (S3 Fig), and furthermore, the total amounts of IRF3 and p65 were not decreased in nsp11-expressing cells, whereas the both phosphorylated IRF3 and I\u03baB were reduced, ruling out the possibility of non-specific degradation of RNA. Indeed, both RIG-I mRNA and MAVS mRNA were reduced by nsp11, whereas IRF3 mRNA and p65 mRNA were not affected (Fig 3F) , suggesting that the mRNA reduction caused by nsp11 was rather selective. So far, from this study, we have identified two targets of nsp11, RIG-I and MAVS. We cannot rule out the existence of other possible substrates of nsp11.",

The restricted distribution of nsp11 in infected cells may be due to its participation in viral replication and may also minimize the nsp11 toxicity by preventing massive degradation of viral and cellular RNAs. Regardless of the cellular distribution, nsp11 retained its ability to decrease the MAVS gene expression, implying the specific reduction of MAVS mRNA by nsp11 in PRRSV-infected cells.",

The amplification was carried out under the following conditions: 95\u02daC for 2 min, followed by 18 cycles of 95\u02daC for 1 min, 58\u02daC for 50 sec and 68\u02daC for 22 min ending with 68\u02daC for 7 min. PCR products were digested with 1 unit Dpn I for 1 h. And the products were transformed into XL Golden E. coli cells (QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Desired nucleotide changes and respective primers were listed in S1 Table. An out-of-frame nsp11 defective mutant (Ins-mut) was made by inserting an additional 'C' immediately upstream of the first nucleotide of the H3735 codon.",

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was included as an nsp11-unrelated virus control. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV or VSV with an MOI of 0.1, and endogenous MAVS mRNA was examined by qRT-PCR. In VSV-infected cells, the amount of MAVS mRNA was increased, showing the normal cellular response to viral infection as anticipated(Fig 3C, 3Dand S4BFig). In PRRSV-infected cells, the decrease of MAVS mRNA and protein became evident at D3 post-infection(Fig 3C and 3D). This event was rather late and we think this may be due to the slow replication and spread of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. The viral titers for both viruses were comparable at the time of collection, indicating both viruses replicated well in MARC-145 cells(Fig 3C). To further examine the decrease of MAVS during early viral infection, MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 5 and MAVS expression was examined by immunofluorescence at 24 h post-infection. Both nsp11 and MAVS proteins were found to localize in the perinuclear region, but MAVS was diminished in PRRSV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells(Fig 3E, See S6 Fig for more cells). Together, our data indicate that MAVS mRNA was reduced in both nsp11-gene transfected cells and PRRSV-infected cells, and the reduction of MAVS mRNA led to less protein expression, subsequently interfering with RLR signaling.",
