We have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. Here we attempted to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, as well as an N-terminal polyhistidine tag that can be used for radiolabeling with technetium tricarbonyl. Results: In order to increase circulation time, we experimented with PEGylated and unPEGylated varities typo particle. We also tested the effect of incorporating different numbers of bombesins per nanoparticle. Biophysical characterization determined that all configurations assemble into regular particles with relatively monodisperse size distributions, having peaks of about 33 -36 nm. The carbonyl method used for labeling produced approximately 80% labeled nanoparticles. In vitro, the nanoparticles showed high binding, both specific and non-specific, to PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, high uptake was observed for all nanoparticle types in the spleens of CD-1 nu/nu mice, decreasing significantly over the course of 24 hours. High uptake was also observed in the liver, while only low uptake was seen in both the pancreas and a tumor xenograft.",

Low uptake in the pancreas and tumor indicate that there is little or no specific targeting. PEGylation or increasing the amount of bombesins per nanoparticle did not significantly improve targeting. In particular, the uptake in the spleen, which is a primary organ of the immune system, highlights the potential of the nanoparticles as vaccine carriers. Also, the decrease in liver and spleen radioactivity with time implies that the nanoparticles are broken down and cleared. This is an important finding, as it shows that the nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates that technetium carbonyl radiolabeling of our protein-based nanoparticles can be used to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.",

It is assumed that nanoparticles would bring about a better target to non-target ratio of drug uptake in drug delivery approaches. An interesting way to produce nanoparticles is the use of polypeptides, which are present in folded or unfolded form, depending on the nature and concentration of a salt in aqueous solution. The crucial point is that such peptides are selected, which stick together during the folding process in a well-defined amount and thus form a spherical nanoparticle [5] . We have used coiled-coil domains as building blocks to engineer self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPN) [6] [7] [8] . Such proteins can be produced with genetically engineered cells and can be extended at the N or C-terminus with freely selectable amino acid residues. If the peptide sequence of a known antigen is used, formation of the nanoparticle will result in the repetitive display of that antigen. We have used this concept to produce promising vaccine candidates for illnesses such as influenza, malaria, SARS, and HIV [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Here we tried to use the same system to develop nanoparticles for drug targeting and medical imaging. The N-terminus of the peptide chain usually comprises six histidines, a so-called His-tag, which is used to separate the engineered peptide on a Ni-NTA-column. The His-tag is not only a chelator for Ni on the column but has a high affinity for the Technetium tricarbonyl as well, and thus, it can be used for labeling with the Technetium carbonyl method [13] [14] [15] . At the C-terminus, in addition to linkers, we have introduced Asn-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met, namely bombesin (BN) (residues [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Bombesin was selected because it is known to have a high affinity to the GRP receptor, which is over-expressed in many tumors. Moreover, we have investigated the free bombesin peptide for many years [16, 17] . Radiotracers consisting of biologically active compounds and radionuclides are powerful tools in three different areas of medical applications [18] [19] [20] [21] , namely diagnosis, therapy, and drug development. The latter gained increasing interest since the introduction of a radiolabeled drug analogue to study a limited number of patients or healthy volunteers gives insight into the properties and behavior of a drug in humans. Generally, positron emitters such as C-11 (at the place of C-12) or F-18 (substituting stable -H or -OH) are used for this purpose because the quantification of the organ uptake is much easier with positron emission tomography (PET) than with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, the radiation burden with PET is rather high and considerable reduction could be achieved if a Technetium-99 m ( 99m Tc) labeled analogue was applied.",

To this aim the protein chain of the nanoparticle was modified with the tumor targeting peptide bombesin and then co-assembled with the same protein chain without bombesin at different ratios. Nanoparticles are known to be trapped in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), mainly in the liver like the labeled colloids, which have been introduced in the nuclear medicine long ago. Since this elimination from the blood stream strongly hampers the uptake into other target tissues we also introduced poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coated particles, an approach that has previously successfully been used [22, 23] . Radioactive technetium was then attached to the His-tag of the protein and the biodistribution was assessed in a mouse model ( Figure 1 ). No increased accumulation of the radioactivity could be observed in tumor cells, even when the particles were PEGylated. However, the biodistribution strongly indicates that these nanoparticles are ideal vaccine candidates as they significantly accumulate in the spleen, which plays an important role in the immune system. These results support our previous findings [9] [10] [11] [12] , which demonstrate the nanoparticles' ability to act as effective vaccines.",

Figure 2 shows the amino acid sequences of the three different peptides used in this study. The density of bombesin was varied by co-assembly of P6c (or P6c-PbK) with P6c-BN at different ratios (Table 1) , while the PEG moiety was either attached to P6c or P6c-PbK. Both P6c and P6c-PbK peptides have two primary amine groups (\u03b1-NH 2 from the methionine residue, and \u03b5-NH 2 from the lysine 12 in P6c and lysine 127 in P6c-PbK, respectively, all depicted in orange in Figure 2 ) in each chain. However, the lysine side chain in P6c is located between two bulky tryptophan residues and might therefore not be accessible enough for efficient coupling of the PEG moiety. Also, in P6c the two coupling sites are both located on the N-terminal end of the nanoparticle peptide chain. Therefore, in the P6c-PbK peptide the lysine coupling site was engineered to the C-terminus at the Therefore, in the P6c-PbK peptide the lysine coupling site was engineered to the C-terminus at the very end of a peptide surface modification (GGSGDPPPPNPNDPPPPNPND) that previously produced very nice nanoparticles [24] , hence it was moved from a less exposed site on the N-terminus to a wellexposed site on the C-terminus. It was expected that in the P6c-PbK design the coupling efficiency is higher and that the PEG moiety is more surface exposed on the nanoparticles.",

The N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) functional group reacts with the primary amine groups in the peptides. SDS-PAGE was used for analyzing the PEGylation products, as shown in Figure 3 . The P6c PEGylation products have an extra band that ran slightly above the P6c monomer band ( Figure 3 , left panel, lane C), which indicated that some of the P6c peptide chains were PEGylated. The PEGylation ratio is about 30-50% by estimating the intensity of the two bands. As shown in Figure 3 , right panel, the unPEGylated (lane E) and the P6c-PbK PEGylation (lane F) products showed similar results, except the extra band that ran above the P6c-PbK monomer band after PEGylation. This extra band is the trimeric form of the protein because it forms a stable coiled-coil even under the strongly denaturing conditions of the SDS-PAGE. The PEGylation ratio for the P6c-PbK peptide is also about 30-50 % by estimating the intensity of the two bands. The PEGylation reaction often produces a mixture of heterogeneous PEGylated compounds. It is difficult to determine the number and location of the PEG molecules from the SDS-PAGE analysis, and hence it is also difficult to detect a difference in the coupling efficiency between the two peptide chains.",

Roughly 80% (\u00b1 10%) of the injected activity was trapped in the liver ( Figure 6 ). Since the weight of the liver showed inter-animal variation between 650 and 1200 mg, concentrations from 60% up to 140% injected dose per g tissue were obtained ( Table 2 ). The uptake per whole spleen was only 1% of the injected dose in the case of P6c-PbK-PEG/P6c-BN 50:10; a slight increase at 4 h and decrease at 24 h post injection were seen ( Figure 6) . A diverging behavior concerns the time course of the % ID/g ( Table 2 ). There the Tc-labeled P6c-PbK-PEG/P6c-BN 50:10 decreases strongly from 21% ID/g (at 1 h) to 9% ID/g (at 24 h). The reason is the variable weight of the spleen. In most experiments animals with light and heavy spleens were rather uniformly distributed among the type of particles and time points. Only in the case of P6c-PbK-PEG/P6c-BN 50:10 it happened that the ''1 h group'' had light spleens (average 77 g) while the ''24 h group'' had rather heavy spleens (average 121 g). The other three types of particles showed an uptake of 3% (\u00b1 1 %) at 1 h post injection. Specific bombesin mediated uptake would show elevated values of 99m Tc activity in the pancreas and the tumor. However, in agreement with the in vitro data this was not observed. The uptake in the stomach and colon was low, very close to that of the intestine at all time points. PEGylation did not appear to significantly affect the biodistribution.",

The nanoparticles showed a rather monodisperse size distribution that was not affected by coupling of PEG to the nanoparticles. The uptake pattern in liver and spleen ( Figure 6 ) reflects a non-specific uptake in the RES, which is mainly depending on the size and maybe on the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the particle surface. Tr\u00f6ster et al. [26] have shown that lower spleen uptake correlates with higher lipophilicity. Surprisingly, we observed exactly the opposite: the more hydrophilic and hence less lipophilic P6c-PbK was less accumulated in the spleen than P6c ( Figure 6 ). The peptide GGSGDPPPPNPNDPPPPNPNDK carries four charges and is quite hydrophilic. Furthermore, when incorporating a higher proportion of the hydrophobic bombesin into the nanoparticle, uptake in the spleen was increased. While the liver uptake was around 80% of the injected dose 1 h after injection and showing virtually no variation, the uptake in the spleen was around 3% of the injected dose and considerably lower (1%) with the P6c-PbK-PEG/P6c-BN 50:10 particles. The observed uptake is quite similar to the distribution observed with 99m Tc labeled colloidal preparations, which is attributed to the properties of the RES. Depending on the nature of the colloids basically the size of the particles, increased uptake in either liver, spleen or bone marrow was seen. The uptake in the liver is quite high as would have been expected for protein-based materials. Unfortunately, the uptake could not be reduced by PEGylation of the nanoparticles but stays roughly the same for all the preparations used in this study.",

Since the intact particles are roughly ten times larger than compounds, which would pass the glomerulum (cut off about 50 kDa or 4 nm diameter), this clearance must be due to broken down particles and short peptide chains. Another possibility would be simply a decomposition of the Tc-complex. However, if only the Tc-complex would be destroyed, the free Tc would be oxidized rapidly to pertechnetate which subsequently would lead to an increased uptake in the stomach. Such uptake was not observed. The in vitro tests showed a high binding to the cells, which increased with time. This time course was slightly different depending on the nature of the nanoparticles. However, no experiment showed any specific uptake, which could be attributed to the bombesin moieties on the particle surface.",

Our study also shows that the nanoparticles might be safely applied as the metabolism and elimination at least indicates that no long-term problems must be considered. In this respect we have also shown that radiolabeling of nanoparticles is a tool with high potential for performing pharmacokinetic studies of such nanoparticle vaccines. It should be noted that the originally planned application of the SAPNs presented here, namely drug targeting and imaging, does not appear feasible at this time, warranting further development.",

The P6c peptide has a His-tag sequence (22 amino acids, black) at the N-terminus, followed by a pentameric domain (36 amino acids, green) and a trimeric domain (46 amino acids). The P6cPbK peptide was created based on the P6c peptide, but with a lysine residue at its C-terminus. In the peptide P6c-BN, the sequence was extended at its Cterminal end with a flexible linker (GSGSGSGSGS) and nine residues (NQWAVGHLM) from the peptide bombesin. The sequences of P6c, P6c-PbK and P6c-BN are shown in Figure 2 .",
