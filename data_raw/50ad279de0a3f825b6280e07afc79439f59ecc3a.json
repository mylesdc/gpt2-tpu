The objective of this study was to determine the role of XB130 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic responses and acute lung injury. LPS was intraperitoneally administrated to Xb130 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. There was a significant weight loss in KO mice at Day 2 and significantly higher disease scores during the 7 days of observation. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in the serum were significantly higher in KO mice at Day 2. In KO mice there were a significantly higher lung injury score, higher wet/dry lung weight ratio, more apoptotic cells and less proliferative cells in the lung. Macrophage infiltration was significantly elevated in the lung of KO mice. There was significantly increased number of p-GSK-3\u03b2 positive cells in KO mice, which were mainly neutrophils and macrophages. XB130 is expressed in alveolar type I and type II cells in the lung. The expression in these cells was significantly reduced after LPS challenge. XB130 deficiency delayed the recovery from systemic septic responses, and the presence of XB130 in the alveolar epithelial cells may provide protective mechanisms by reducing cell death and promoting cell proliferation, and reducing pulmonary permeability.",

By contrary, XB130 expression was an independent prognostic factor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [12] . In gastric cancer, reduced XB130 protein expression is a prognostic biomarker for shorter survival and a higher recurrence rate [13] . On the other hand, in human ductal breast cancer, XB130 was present in the cytoplasm of malignant cells, but not in the normal breast cells, and positive XB130 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival and recurrence free survival [14] . XB130, thus, may play different role in tumorigenesis depending upon the types of cancers.",

Moreover, the interaction between XB130 and another adaptor protein, Tks5, mediates EGF and serum-induced proliferation and survival of human bronchial epithelial cells [15] . To determine the physiological function and tumorigenesis of XB130 in vivo, XB130 knockout (KO) mice have been generated. XB130 deficiency could slow down the differentiation of proliferating basal cells to ciliated epithelial cells during the repair process in trachea [16] .

To determine if XB130 plays a role in systemic septic response, we challenged animals with LPS intraperitoneally. We observed significant differences between Xb130 KO and WT mice, in terms of body weight loss and composite disease score after LPS treatment. Moreover, the serum levels of several cytokines at Day 2 of LPS treatment were significantly higher in Xb130 KO mice. MCP-1 is a CC chemokine for the recruitment of monocytes and other inflammatory cells to the sites of tissue injury and infection [23, 24] . The pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) can activate neutrophils, which adhere to the affected capillary endothelium and migrate into air spaces, leading to severe lung injury [25, 26] . IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays protective roles in controlling immunopathology during ALI [27, 28] . The expression of IL-10 can be rapidly induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 [27, 28] . In this study, the levels of these cytokines in serum increased at 2 and 6 hours after LPS treatment in both groups, and then decreased in WT mice at Day 2, but remained significantly higher in the Xb130 KO mice. The XB130 deficiency may not affect LPS challenge-induced rapid systemic inflammatory response, but may delay the recovery. At Day 2, the histology of spleen, kidney and liver appeared relatively normal, which may be due to the recovery of these critical organs from LPS challenge. The gene expression of XB130 is relatively higher in the spleen [6] , which is important for immunological response. However, we did not see morphological differences between KO and WT in the spleen, kidney and liver. Therefore, why serum cytokine levels in KO mice remaining high should be further studied.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury is one of the most common and severe complications in septic shock [19] . In the present study, severe lung injury with more apoptotic cells, and higher W/D weight ratio and less cell proliferation were observed in Xb130 KO mice at Day 2 after LPS treatment. Cell death and inflammation may contribute to increased vascular permeability and tissue damage [29, 30] . Xb130, as an upstream regulator of PI3K/Akt pathway, specifically binds p85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K and leads to its activation [6] . Knocking down Xb130 with siRNA in thyroid or lung cancer cells reduced cell survival, increased susceptibilities of cells to extrinsic and intrinsic signalinduced cell death, which was associated with increased cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9. Down-regulation of XB130 also reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, together with reduced phosphorylation of p21, p27, GSK-3\u03b2 and FOXO3\u03b1 [3, 7, 31] . XB130 is also required for cAMP-induced amplification of IGF related mitogenicity in thyroid cells [9] . We did not specify the cell types that undergoing apoptosis or proliferation, however, we did show expression of XB130 in the alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, we would like to propose that the lack of XB130 in lung epithelial cells may contribute to apoptotic cell death in the lung after LPS stimulation, and subsequently increase the pulmonary permeability and edema. The reduced cell proliferation may explain the delayed repair of lung epithelium. To determine whether the lack of XB130 expression affects PI3K/Akt pathway, we performed IHC staining for phosphorylated p85\u03b1, Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 on lung tissues. The staining of these proteins was very weak on the alveolar wall in both WT and KO animals (data not shown). After LPS treatment, Xb130 mRNA level was significantly reduced in the lung of WT mice, and the staining for XB130 was also extremely weak in alveolar cells. LPS and TNF-\u03b1 treatment reduced XB130 protein level in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (unpublished data); LPS may inhibit XB130 expression and reduce the protective effects of XB130 in ALI. This may also explain the weak staining of phosphorylation of p85\u03b1 and Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 on alveolar wall.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the numbers of p-GSK-3\u03b2 positively stained macrophages and neutrophils were significantly higher in Xb130 KO mice after LPS treatment. GSK-3\u03b2 is a serine threonine protein kinase, and a downstream target of PI3K/Akt pathway. Human monocytes stimulated with E. coli LPS demonstrated increased Ser 9 phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 [32] . The higher numbers of p-GSK-3\u03b2 positive macrophages and neutrophils may be due to prolonged injury and delayed the repair of lung epithelial cells. The accumulation of macrophages in the lung tissue in Xb130 KO mice may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALI [33] [34] [35] . In conclusion, our results indicate that the presence of XB130 is protective to systemic septic response and related acute lung injury. Its deficiency reduces cell survival, promotes the infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveoli, increases pulmonary permeability, reduces cell proliferation, and slows down the repair process. XB130 expression can be inhibited by LPS challenge. Other ALI animal models should be used to further explore the roles of XB130. Moreover, the role of XB130 should be addressed directly in human ALI. (B) Immunofluorescence studies shows that the intensity of XB130 (red) expression in alveolar epithelial cells was extremely weak after LPS administration.

The Xb130 primer pairs used were 5\u2032-TCAGCATCTCCAGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGCTGTTTCCTCTCT-3\u2032 (reverse). Each assay included a standard curve of six serial dilutions and notemplate negative control. All assays were performed in triplicate. The relative expression level of Xb130 was calculated after normalization with housekeeping gene GAPDH. www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget Cytokine/chemokine measurement For measurement of cytokine/chemokine, a separate set of animals was used with 5 mice per group. The serum was collected at 2, 6 and 48 hours after treatment, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from the whole lung was collected at 48 hours after treatment as previously described [41] . Cytokines/chemokines levels in serum and cell-free BAL samples were measured using Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnet Bead Panel (MCYTOMAG-70K-12, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).",
