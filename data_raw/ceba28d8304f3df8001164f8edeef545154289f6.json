JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a ubiquitous constituent of the human virome. With altered immunological status, JCPyV can cause the oft-fatal brain demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). JCPyV is a human-only pathogen. Using the mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) encephalitis model, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells regulate development of functional antiviral brain-resident CD8 T cells (bT RM ) and renders their maintenance refractory to systemic CD8 T cell depletion. Acquired CD4 T cell deficiency, modeled by delaying systemic CD4 T cell depletion until MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells have infiltrated the brain, impacted the stability of CD8 bT RM , impaired their effector response to reinfection, and rendered their maintenance dependent on circulating CD8 T cells. This dependence of CD8 bT RM differentiation on CD4 T cells was found to extend to encephalitis caused by vesicular stomatitis virus. Together, these findings reveal an intimate association between CD4 T cells and homeostasis of functional bT RM to CNS viral infection.",

Our findings demonstrate that CD4 T cells are essential for establishing long-lasting, virus-specific CD8 bT RM for antiviral CNS immunosurveillance.

Thirteen polyomaviruses to date have been identified as constituents of the human virome, but several [BKPyV, JCPyV, and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)] are opportunistic pathogens known to cause life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised individuals [6] . JCPyV is acquired in early adolescence probably via gastrointestinal routes of infection, reaches seropositivity rates over 60% by sixty years of age, and persists in the kidney, urinary tract, bone marrow, and possibly the brain [7, 8] . With altered immune status as a consequence of HIV/AIDS, immune-modulating therapeutics for autoimmune diseases (e.g., natalizumab for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis), and biologic anti-cancer agents, JCPyV can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) [6] . Polyomaviruses productively infect and persist only in their host reservoir species. An acknowledged impediment to understanding PML pathogenesis and the immunovirologic factors that put patients at risk for PML is the absence of tractable animal models [9] . Human astrocytes/oligodendrocytes engrafted in brains of immune and myelin deficient (RAG2 -/-MBP shi/shi ) mice support JCPyV replication and virus-induced loss of these glial cells results in demyelination [10] . However, deciphering the immunological deficits that predispose patients to PML remains to be determined.",

Furthermore, memory differentiation is aberrant in unhelped CD8 T cells, as demonstrated by impaired upregulation of L-selectin (CD62L), IL-7R\u03b1 (CD127), and the CD27 costimulatory molecule [15, 16] . Recall responses of unhelped memory CD8 T cells to infection with vaccinia virus are restrained by PD-1 [17] , and vaccine-elicited unhelped CD8 T cells express multiple inhibitory receptors [18] .

Other models of central nervous system (CNS) viral infection, however, suggest that CD4 T cell help is necessary for CD8 T cell function and CD8 bT RM development. Unhelped CD8 T cells cannot control West Nile Virus (WNV) infection and gradually lose the ability to produce effector cytokines [20] . CD8 T cells in the CNS of CD4 T cell-deficient mice inoculated intracerebrally with a neurotropic mouse coronavirus had reduced IFN-\u03b3 and granzyme B expression, impaired viral control, disrupted memory differentiation, and increased apoptosis [21] [22] [23] . CD4 T cell help to CD8 T cells and B cells is also pivotal in the control of measles virus encephalitis [24, 25] . For PML, it is interesting to note a case report documenting isolation of JCPyV DNA carrying a mutation that ablates a JCPyV-specific CD4 T cell epitope [26] . These studies highlight the discrepant data on the dependence of CD4 T cell help for sustaining CD8 bT RM formation during CNS viral infections, and point toward the possibility that such CD4 T cell dependence may be contextdependent.",

MuPyV inoculation, virus-specific CD8 T cells are recruited to the brain and establish a CD8 bT RM population [34] [35] [36] . MuPyV inoculated i.c. spreads systemically [34] . We found that unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells infiltrated the brain and were functional during early stages of MuPyV infection, but failed to control virus during reinfection. We previously described the contrast in dependence of braininfiltrating CD4 T cells, but not of CD8 T cells, on their circulating counterparts [34] . Here, we found that maintenance of unhelped CD8 T cells required resupply from CD8 T cells in the vasculature. The transcriptome of unhelped CD8 T cells showed disruption of genes involved in pathways of T RM function and homeostasis. Moreover, CD4 T cell insufficiency impaired differentiation of functional virus-specific CD8 bT RM not only at the stage of na\u00efve CD8 T cell priming, but also after MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells had infiltrated the brain. The importance of CD4 T cells for homeostasis of virus-specific CD8 T cells during a persistent viral encephalitis has clear clinical ramifications for establishing durable immunosurveillance of persistent CNS infections.",

In the spleen, however, fewer unhelped D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 in persistently infected mice (S2A Fig). Helped and unhelped D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells in the brain had similar sensitivity to antigen stimulation, as evidenced by the expression of IRF4 (Fig 2C) , a transcription factor upregulated by TCR engagement [37] . Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and CXCL9 mRNA, an IFN-\u03b3induced chemokine, were upregulated compared to uninfected control mice similarly in brains of CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice (Fig 2D) . Although no difference in viral load was observed in brains of CD4 T cell-deficient and -sufficient mice during acute infection, viral loads trended higher during persistent infection in the absence of CD4 T cells (Fig 2E) . Thus, CD4 T cells appear not to overtly impact the magnitude, differentiation, or function of virusspecific CD8 T cells infiltrating the brains of MuPyV-infected mice.",

In CD4 T cell-deficient mice, few CD103 + MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the brain 30 days after MuPyV inoculation ( Fig  3A & 3B and S3A Fig) , although these cells expressed CD69 at levels similar to those in CD4 T cell-sufficient mice (Fig 3C) . During WNV infection of the brain, TGF-\u03b2 produced from regulatory T cells is important for the upregulation of CD103 [38] . In our model, FoxP3 + CD25 + CD4 T cells infiltrate the brain but constitute only 5% of CD44 + CD4 T cells in WT mice (S3B Together, these data support the possibility that TGF-\u03b2 and IL-21 contribute to upregulating CD103 on the virus-specific CD8 T cells during MuPyV infection. Furthermore, unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells had higher PD-1 expression compared to helped virus-specific CD8 T cells (Fig 3D and S3E & S3F Fig) . Diminished expression of CD103, a commonly used marker of T RM cell differentiation, and elevated PD-1 expression raised the possibility that CD4 T cell help qualitatively modulated MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM residing in the brain.",

These data indicated that brain-resident CD8 and CD4 T cells during MuPyV encephalitis showed a dichotomy in their dependence on cells in the circulation. We asked whether maintenance of unhelped MuPyVspecific CD8 T cells in MuPyV-infected mouse brain retained independence from the vascular compartment. To do this, CD8 T cell-depleting mAb was given at day 10 p.i., which was after MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells had infiltrated the brain [34] (Fig 3E) . In CD4 T cell-sufficient mice, depletion of circulating CD8 T cells had no effect on the number of total CD8 T cells or D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells in the brain at day 30 p.i. (Fig 3E) . In marked contrast, the number of total CD8 T cells and D b LT359-specific cells declined approximately 100-fold in CD4 T cell-deficient mice depleted of circulating CD8 T cells at this timepoint (Fig 3E) . Together, these data suggest that CD4 T cell availability for development and maintenance of CD8 bT RM is critical during persistent viral CNS infections.",

To explore this possibility, we used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding the D b LT359 epitope (rVSV-LT359) [40] . CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice had similar frequencies of D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells in the brain 30 days after rVSV-LT359 intranasal (i.n.) inoculation (Fig 4A) . This result confirms that of Wakim et al. who found no differences in antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses between WT and CD4 T cell-deficient mice in brains of mice with VSV encephalitis [19] . We further observed that unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells in brains after i.n. rVSV-LT359 inoculation failed to upregulate CD103 (Fig 4B) . PD-1 expression on unhelped CD8 T cells, however, was not significantly higher (Fig 4C) . Systemic CD8 T cell depletion resulted in loss of D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells in CD4 T cell-depleted mice, but not in CD4 T cell-sufficient mice given \u03b1CD8 (Fig 4D) . Using primers against VSV genomic RNA (gRNA), we were able to detect low levels of VSV gRNA during persistence in both CD4 T cell-sufficient and-deficient mice (S4 Fig). Similarly, a previous study reported persistent VSV gRNA after i.n. infection, but detected no VSV mRNA at the same time point [41] . Collectively, these data indicate that CD4 T cell help is essential for generating CD8 bT RM in both VSV and MuPyV CNS infections.",

CD4 T cell-deficient mice showed no change in the concentration of sodium fluorescein dye in the brain, indicating that the integrity of the BBB was unaltered by systemic CD4 T cell depletion (S5A Fig). Furthermore, systemically administered CD8 T cell-depleting mAb did not stain CD8 T cells in the brain parenchyma, irrespective of CD4 T cell status (S5B Fig). Unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells expressed the adhesion molecules VLA-4, PSGL1, and LFA-1, suggesting that CD4 T cell availability did not alter the ability of these cells to home to and traffic into the infected brain (S5C Fig). To ask whether unhelped CD8 T cells remained in the vasculature and, thus, directly exposed to depleting anti-CD8\u03b1, we performed intravascular staining with FITC-conjugated CD45 mAb. No difference in the ratio of extravascular to intravascular total and virus-specific CD8 T cells was seen between helped and unhelped mice (S5D Fig).

This loss of viral control was observed despite similar numbers and proliferation of brain virus-specific CD8 T cells (Fig 5C & 5D) . Although MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells proliferated rapidly in the reinfected mice, no significant increase was seen in the number of D b LT359 + CD8 T cells in the brain upon rechallenge. This discrepancy between cell proliferation and numbers suggests engagement of a concurrent cell death process. Interestingly, no difference in IRF4 was seen between CD4 T cell helped and unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells, implying comparable levels of TCR activation ( Fig  5E) . Yet, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T cells upon ex vivo LT359 peptide stimulation was lower in rechallenged CD4 T cell-deficient than -sufficient mice (Fig 5F) ; although significant, there was <10% difference between the mock vehicle injected persistently infected rat IgGtreated and CD4 T cell-deficient groups. Using IFN-\u03b3 eYFP reporter mice to visualize effector function by MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in situ, we found that a significantly higher fraction of CD103 + than CD103cells produced IFN-\u03b3 upon reinfection, with CD103 -D b LT359 tetramer + CD8 T cells in both CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice producing little IFN-\u03b3 ( Fig  5G) . This defect was not due to a decrease in CD103cells in brain (Fig 5G) . Without rechallenge, CD103 -T cells from CD4 T cell -sufficient and -deficient mice have similar IFN\u03b3-eYFP production to CD103 + CD8 T cells (Fig 5H) . These results indicate that CD4 T cells during recruitment and maintenance of CD8 bT RM are necessary for effective control of MuPyV CNS reinfection and improved ability to produce IFN-\u03b3.",

However, the contribution of antiviral antibodies to offsetting T cell exhaustion depends on the experimental viral system. MuPyV infection elicits a virus-neutralizing CD4 T cell-independent IgG response directed to VP1, the major polyomavirus capsid protein [43, 44] . Similarly, influenza virus infection also generates a T cell-independent influenza-specific IgG that helps resolve primary influenza infection and prevents reinfection [45] . Despite a decrease in \u03b1VP1 IgG titers in CD4 T cell-depleted mice at day 30 p.i., sera from CD4 T cell-deficient and -sufficient mice exhibited strong virus-neutralization capability during acute and persistent infection (Fig  6A & 6B) . To formally exclude an effect of MuPyV-neutralizing antibodies on peripheral viral load and T cell function during MuPyV rechallenge, WT and MHC II -/mice were passively immunized with a neutralizing VP1 IgG mAb [46] from day 10 p.i. to MuPyV i.c. reinfection at day 30 p.i (Fig 6C) . Despite passive immunization, unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells still exhibited significant deficits in IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig 6D) , while PD-1 expression was increased compared to CD4 T cell-sufficient mice (Fig 6E) . Viral loads were similar in MHCII -/mice with and without mAb VP1 treatment (Fig 6F) . Serum from MHCII -/and WT mice that were passively immunized with \u03b1VP1 possessed similar virus-neutralization capabilities (S6A Fig) . These data demonstrate that virus-specific antibodies did not rescue the unhelped CD8 T cell response.",

            "text": "The common defect in IFN-\u03b3 production by CD103 -MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in WT and CD4 T cell-deficient mice led us to survey the transcriptional landscape of CD103 + and CD103 -D b LT359 tetramer + CD8 T cells sorted from brains of persistently infected WT and MHCII -/mice (S7A Fig); for this analysis, we refer to D b LT359 tetramer + CD8 T cells from MHC-II -/mice as MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells and D b LT359 tetramer + CD103and CD103 + from WT mice as CD103and CD103 + . 377 transcripts were differentially expressed between CD103and MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells, whereas 267 transcripts were differentially expressed between CD103 + and MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells (Fig 7A-7C) . Only 73 transcripts, however, were differentially expressed between helped CD103and CD103 + CD8 T cells (Fig 7A-7C) . These data reveal that CD103and CD103 + cells had similar transcriptomes, both of which were substantially different from the transcriptomes of MHC II -/--CD103cells. Our recent report showing similar phenotype and function by brain-resident, MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells irrespective of CD103 expression [35] are in line with the highly overlapping transcriptomes of CD103 + and CD103 -CD8 T cells. These findings support accumulating evidence that caution is warranted when considering CD103 as a stereotypical marker of T RM differentiation [1, 36] . Ingenuity pathway analysis of MHCII -/--CD103vs CD103 -CD8 T cells revealed significant aberrations in the activation state and homeostasis of unhelped CD8 T cells. MHCII -/--CD103exhibited significant downregulation of pathways including cdc42, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and actin-based motility, which are essential for cell migration (Fig 7D) . Additionally, MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells had downregulated RhoA signaling, which has recently been identified as a central regulator of CD4 T cell viability, proliferation, and migratory capacity in the CNS of EAE mice [47] . Notably, MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells had significant downregulation of Runx3 (S1 Table) , a recently identified component of the transcription factor signature of CD8 T RM [48] . MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells also showed significant upregulation of phosphoinositide pathways (Fig 7D) . Gain-offunction mutations in phosphoinositide pathways have been reported to promote exhaustion and senescence of CD8 T cells [49, 50] . MHCII -/--CD103 -CD8 T cells differentially expressed genes involved in mitochondrial function; mitochondrial dysfunction is highly prevalent in CD8 T cells isolated from HIV + patients [51] . By comparison to MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in brains of MHC-II -/mice, the CD103 + and CD103cells in brains of WT mice shared most of the same gene expression pathways (S7B Fig). Thus, unhelped CD8 T cells during persistent MuPyV infection have a profoundly altered transcriptome in a pattern indicating defective homeostasis and activation.",

We therefore started i.p. administration of CD4 T cell-depleting mAb at day 10 p.i. (Fig 8A) . The number of CD4 T cells significantly CD4 T cells control homeostasis of brain-resident CD8 T cells during polyomavirus infection declined in the brain with systemic anti-CD4 depletion (Fig 8B) . Although no difference was seen in the number of virus-specific CD8 T cells or viral load in the brain with delayed CD4 T cell depletion (Fig 8C & 8D) , the frequency of virus-specific CD103 + CD8 T cells was significantly lower at 30 days p.i. compared to CD4 T cell-sufficient mice (Fig 8E) . Because the frequency of CD103 + D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells was significantly reduced in CD4 T celldeficient mice, we asked whether a decline in CD4 T cells affected development of virus-specific CD8 T RM cells after CNS infiltration. To this end, systemic CD4 T cell depletion began at day 10 p.i., coupled with circulating CD8 T cells at day 20 p.i. (Fig 8F) . The number of total CD8 T cells and MuPyV-specific CD8 T cell and the gMFI of CD8 on the MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells were significantly reduced in CD4 T cell-deficient mice (Fig 8G) . We have CD4 T cells control homeostasis of brain-resident CD8 T cells during polyomavirus infection previously published that increased CD8 gMFI marks bT RM [34] . We next assessed the ability of these unhelped D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells to control MuPyV challenge infection ( Fig  8H) . Five days after reinfection, the number of D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells was not significantly different between CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice (Fig 8I) , but the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was significantly lower (Fig 8J) . Virus levels, however, were the same between CD4 T cell-sufficient and-deficient mice (Fig 8K) . These data support the concept that CD4 T cells are required to sustain functional CD8 bT RM to persistent viral encephalitis.",

In this study, we determined that CD4 T cell help was essential for establishment and maintenance of CD8 bT RM to MuPyV encephalitis. CD4 T cells guided the differentiation of MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM during na\u00efve T cell priming and were required for maintenance of functional antiviral CD8 bT RM in brains of persistently infected mice. Notably, CD4 T cell insufficiency resulted in diminished effector competence of antiviral CD8 T cells encountering MuPyV reinfection in the brain. An ongoing dependence on CD4 T cells for induction and maintenance of virus-specific CD8 bT RM to a persistent CNS infection has clear clinical implications for individuals whose immune status is altered by infection or immunomodulatory therapeutic agents.",

JCPyV recovered from PML patients carry mutations in the VP1 capsid protein that affect binding to sialylated glycans, which serve as receptors for JCPyV entry into host cells [52] . Thus, JCPyV-PML VP1 mutations are thought to alter viral tropism and endow JCPyV with neuropathic potential. Recent evidence, however, supports the alternative possibility that these VP1 mutations serve an immune evasion purpose by preventing recognition by neutralizing antibodies [53] and by ablating VP1-specific CD4 T cell epitopes [26] . These findings have motivated efforts to isolate monoclonal antibodies capable of broadly cross-neutralizing wild type and VP1 mutant JCPyVs to protect patients at-risk of and as therapeutics for PML [54] . In the pre-combination antiretroviral therapy era, PML had an approximately 5% incidence in patients with HIV/AIDS, a disease initiated by profound CD4 T cell deficiency [55] . Individuals with idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphopenia, which manifests without overt changes in CD8 T cells, B cells, or NK cells, are also at elevated risk for PML [56] . JCPyV VP1/LT-specific CD8 T cell adoptive immunotherapy in a PML patient drove viral DNA below PCR detectability in the CSF and improved neurological status [57] . Our data together with these studies suggest that preserving and augmenting anti-JCPyV CD4 T cells or providing \"helper\" cytokines in PML-susceptible individuals, and using such interventions to supplement CD8 T cell immunotherapy for PML, could promote differentiation of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells into CD8 bT RM and improve disease prognosis.",

In the MuPyV system, however, CD4 T cell deficiency did not result in higher virus levels, and helped and unhelped CD8 T cells had equivalent functional competence (Fig 2) . Yet, PD-1 expression was increased on unhelped virusspecific CD8 T cells (Fig 2 and S3 Fig). Similarly, unhelped CD8 T cells that infiltrate HSV-1-infected sensory ganglia upregulate PD-1 and retain effector functionality [61] . Additionally, HSV-1 latency is maintained [61] .

A large body of literature documents that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response during persistent viral infections is regulated, in part, by IL-21 and IL-2 produced by CD4 T cells [63] [64] [65] . Other studies, however, have shown that IL-10, usually considered an immunosuppressive cytokine, can promote maturation of memory CD8 T cells [66] . CD4 T cells may indirectly affect the quantity and quality of CD8 T cell responses via helping anti-viral antibody production and affinity maturation to control extent of persistent infection [11] . Maintenance of CD8 T cells during persistent MuPyV infection may also depend on de novo priming of na\u00efve virus-specific CD8 T cells. Ongoing de novo recruitment over an infection that changes dynamically, including progressing from systemic to tissue-localized infection, could contribute to CD8 T cell heterogeneity [67] . De novo recruitment of MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells is CD4 T celldependent; thus, the level of availability of CD4 T cell help may conceivably regulate this avenue for CD8 T cell differentiation, including those that populate a T RM cell compartment [68] . Similarly, in mice persistently infected with the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells were primed and recruited to the CNS [69] . In sum, these studies demonstrate that the nature of CD4 T cell help is dynamic.",

We previously reported that MuPyV infection was controlled in mice lacking TNF receptors or perforin and/or Fas as efficiently as in WT mice, and that IFN\u03b3 and IFN-I inhibited MuPyV replication in vivo [32, 33, 71] . Likewise, IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-I inhibited JCPyV replication in established human glial cell lines and primary human glial cells [72, 73] . Noteworthy is an incidental observation in a phase III clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of IFN-\u03b3 on reducing incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS subjects where none of the subjects in the IFN-\u03b3 cohort developed PML as opposed to a 10% incidence in the placebo group [74] . In this study, we found that reinfection with MuPyV was more efficiently controlled in CD4 T cell-sufficient than -deficient mice when CD4 T cells were systemically depleted at the time of na\u00efve virus-specific CD8 T cell priming; however, in MuPyVinfected mice where CD4 T cell depletion was delayed, no difference in viral control was seen on i.c. reinfection (Fig 8) . Because MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells suffered a deficit in IFN-\u03b3 functionality in early and delayed CD4 T cell-deficient situations, IFN-\u03b3 may not be the sole anti-MuPyV effector mechanism. In this connection, PML has also been diagnosed in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, albeit not as frequently as in HIV/AIDS patients [75] , and anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment was associated with a low incidence of PML in these patients [76] .",

The role of CD103 in maintaining T RM appears to vary between tissues; its expression is particularly important for retention in small intestine mucosal epithelium and skin epidermis [78, 79] . Interestingly, we found that virus-specific CD8 bT RM expressing CD103 had superior IFN-\u03b3 activity upon CNS re-infection with MuPyV (Fig 5) . Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-specific CD8 T RM lacking CD103 localize with infectious foci in the intestinal lamina propria, where early inflammatory cues from infiltrating macrophages control the size of the CD103population [80] . However, no geographic differences based on CD103 expression have been described for CD8 bT RM responding to brain infections [5, 81] . Studies are ongoing to define anti-MuPyV effector mechanism(s) in the CNS and potential preferential expression of effector activities by antiviral CD8 T cells.",

Using the VSV encephalitis mouse model, we determined that CD4 T cell help also rendered virus-specific CD8 T cells susceptible to systemic CD8 T cell depletion. Thus, we found that the link between CD4 T cell help and establishment of CD8 bT RM applies to both MuPyV and VSV encephalitis. Loss of CD4 T cells either during na\u00efve CD8 T cell priming or after CD8 T cell effectors have accessed the CNS renders brain-localized CD8 T cells dependent on those in the circulation. Evidence presented here supports the concept that an intact systemic CD4 T cell compartment is essential for preserving a steady-state d\u00e9tente between CD8 bT RM and persistent viral infection in the CNS.

Live cells were stained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, Germany), CD44, CD8, APC-D b LT359 tetramer, and CD103 and then sorted under BSL-2 conditions on a BD FACS Aria SORP (BD Biosciences) instrument. The collected cells were lysed with 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) and immediately frozen on dry ice for storage at -80\u02daC until further processing. The cDNA libraries were prepared using the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing-v4 (TAKARA Bio, CA) and Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The unique barcode sequences were incorporated in the adaptors for multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. The final product was assessed for its size distribution and concentration using BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA). The libraries were pooled and diluted to 2 nM in EB buffer (Qiagen, MD) and then denatured using the Illumina protocol. The denatured libraries were diluted to 10 pM by pre-chilled hybridization buffer and loaded onto HiSeq SR Rapid v2 flow cells on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and run for 64 cycles using a single-read recipe (HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2, Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Illumina CASAVA pipeline (released version 1.8, Illumina) was used to obtain de-multiplexed sequencing reads (fastq files) passed the default purify filter. Reads were mapped to the mm10 transcriptome with STAR [92] and gene-level quantification performed with RSEM [93] . Differential tests were performed in DESeq2 using the SARTools pipeline [94] The list of differentially upregulated and downregulated genes with FDR < 0.05 was imported to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for pathway enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB) as the reference set. All analysis was done using the software contextual analysis settings for mouse CD8 T cells. The enrichment significance by P-value between the gene list and the canonical pathway analysis was measured by Fisher's exact test. The enrichment factor is the ratio of the number of genes in a given pathway divided by the total number of genes in the pathway.",
