            "text": "Several clinical scoring systems for diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in calves have been proposed. However, such systems were based on subjective judgment, rather than statistical methods, to weight scores. Data from a pair-matched case-control study on a California calf raising facility was used to develop three novel scoring systems to diagnose BRD in preweaned dairy calves. Disease status was assigned using both clinical signs and diagnostic test results for BRD-associated pathogens. Regression coefficients were used to weight score values. The systems presented use nasal and ocular discharge, rectal temperature, ear and head carriage, coughing, and respiratory quality as predictors. The systems developed in this research utilize fewer severity categories of clinical signs, require less calf handling, and had excellent agreement (Kappa > 0.8) when compared to an earlier scoring system. The first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. The second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. The third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. The first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (\u226539.2 \u2022 C or 102.5 \u2022 F, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized \"BRD positive\" if their total score was \u22654. This system correctly classified 95.4% cases and 88.6% controls. The second presented system categorized the predictors and assigned weights as follows: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), mild nasal discharge (unilateral, serous, or watery discharge, 3 points), moderate to severe nasal discharge (bilateral, cloudy, mucoid, mucopurlent, or copious discharge, 5 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 1 point), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (\u226539.2 \u2022 C, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal How to cite this article Love et al.

Respiratory disease is the leading cause of death in weaned dairy heifers and the second most common cause of mortality in pre-weaned calves in cattle herds in the United States. It is estimated that BRD is responsible for the loss of more than one million animals and approximately US $700 million annually (USDA, 2007; Wittum et al., 1996) . Effective control of BRD has proven difficult in the North American dairy industry, at least in part due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis and the ubiquity of BRD-associated pathogens (Gorden & Plummer, 2010) .",

Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica (Griffin et al., 2010) , and Mycoplasma bovis (Caswell et al., 2010) , may be naturally present in small numbers in the nasal passages of healthy cattle but can be opportunistically pathogenic when the host's defenses become impaired.

Clinical scoring systems use information that can be rapidly collected from patients to assess patient health and prognosis and have been used in a variety of human and veterinary applications (Champion et al., 1981; Champion et al., 1989; Sullivan, Massaro & D'Agostino, 2004; Tollner, 1982) . Scoring systems assign values to clinical signs, which are used to determine a total score. The patient's total score, in turn, should correspond to their risk or likelihood of disease. Objective methods should be used to weight scores using clinical data to ensure that similar scores represent similar risks and to optimize score performance. Clinical signs that are difficult to measure with adequate precision or that require expensive or time-consuming methods to measure should not be included (Sullivan, Massaro & D'Agostino, 2004) .",

The DART system does not appear in peer-reviewed literature and is difficult to standardize between locations because the clinical sign weights and decision points are not defined. The WI score is the most suitable of the three cited scores with published score weights and a decision rule. However, the WI score subdivides each of its clinical signs into 4 levels, which may have ambiguous overlap to inexperienced individuals making it difficult to appropriately classify clinical signs in calves. Until recently, information regarding these systems' diagnostic performance in the field have not been published. A single published study has estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the WI scoring system as 55.4% and 58.0%, respectively (Buczinski et al., 2013) .

Therefore, rectal temperatures in excess of 39.2 \u2022 C may be considered febrile and consistent with an inflammatory response to BRD. Rectal temperatures below the reported normal physiologic lower limit, 38.1 \u2022 C, were not considered to be abnormal for the purposes of this study.

The score weights and cut-points of these scoring systems were selected using statistical estimation, in contrast to previously described systems in which score weights and cut-points were determined subjectively. All three scoring systems had excellent agreement with the WI score. The BRD1 scoring system correctly classified 91.5% of the calves in the study, but required handling calves without spontaneous cough in an attempt to elicit an induced cough. The BRD2 scoring system correctly classified 90.8% of the calves in the study and did not require additional calf handling to induce coughing, but had three levels of nasal discharge, instead of two. The BRD3 scoring system correctly classified 90.2% of the enrolled calves, did not require additional calf handling to attempt inducing a cough, and included only dichotomous predictors for all the clinical signs. Given similar performance to the WI scoring systems, our BRD scoring systems require less qualitative assessment of clinical signs and hence offer simpler algorithms for on-farm diagnosis of BRD in pre-weaned dairy calves. Specifically, BRD3 would be most feasible on dairies and calf raising facilities for daily observation of large calf numbers in intensive dairy systems, this is due to the simplicity of the dichotomized clinical signs and reduced calf handling required to obtain the final score.

Nevertheless, the three scoring systems developed in this study are described and presented to demonstrate the selection process and allow end users to select the system that best suits their needs. The systems presented here are the first clinical scoring systems for BRD published in peer-reviewed literature for which clinical data was used to weight scores and set cut-points. Prior to this study, the WI scoring system was the most widely accepted scoring system used in dairy medicine, but important pieces of information about this system, such as methods used to assign S cp and S p , sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and reliability, are absent from peer-reviewed literature. Further, the WI system uses 5 clinical predictors, each with 4 levels, and only uses four of these predictors to assign a score to the calf since the lower score of eyes and ears are dropped from the score. The systems presented here use 6 clinical predictors each with 2 levels, with the exception of nasal discharge in the BRD2 score, which has 3 levels, and use all 6 clinical predictors to assign total scores. It is anticipated that the inclusion of fewer levels of clinical predictors will improve the reliability and acceptance of the score.",

Case definitions that are based on multiple criteria are employed frequently and considered suitable so long as the criteria are appropriate for the goals of the study (Coggon et al., 2005) . The algorithm, shown in Fig. 1 , was developed to best identify cases and controls based on the available data. The detection of a primary pathogen for BRD, such as BRSV, using a sensitive and specific method, such as qPCR, indicates a high index of suspicion that the pathogen is present and the calf has BRD. The isolation of opportunistically pathogenic organisms, such as P. multocida and Mycoplasma bovis, is a much less specific criterion for BRD because these bacteria are commonly isolated from cattle without BRD. The specificity of bacterial isolation was improved by incorporating clinical information quantified by the WI scores. The WI system can be a useful method to quantify clinical BRD signs and was effectively employed in this study because two of the researchers were veterinarians with substantial calf experience which allowed for consistent evaluation and scoring of calves for BRD at enrollment. Classification as a case using the combined results of the WI score and bacterial isolation is a form of serial test interpretation, a strategy used to improve test specificity and reduce false positive results (Thurmond & Johnson, 2004) . Table 8 Diagnostic performance for the BRD3 scoring system to correctly identify calves with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), calves without BRD (controls), all calves, and likelihood ratio positive (LR+) in a sample of 2030 Holstein bull and heifer calves prior to weaning and housed on a calf ranch in California's San Joaquin Valley. All discrete values of S cp are presented except, 0, which was non-informative. The decision rule used was to classify calves as score positive for BRD if S total \u2265 S cp , and score negative otherwise. The greatest proportion of calves identified over all of the possible cut-points was 90.2% when the cut-point was set to 5 (S cp optimal = 5). As diagnostic tools, BRD scoring systems are most informative when estimates of the test sensitivity and specificity are known (Dohoo, Martin & Stryhn, 2010) . The conditional probability that S i,total \u2265 S cp given i was a case, and that S i,total < S cp given that i was a control, could be interpreted as cut-point specific estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. However, these values were not interpreted as sensitivity and specificity in this study because of concerns that these estimates may be biased compared to the true sensitivity and specificity, due to two potential sources of selection bias. The first source arises from the use of the WI score in the case definition because the clinical signs used by the WI score were also included as predictors in the models for the BRD1, BRD2, and BRD3 systems. Hence, sampling of the cases and controls may not have been independent of the predictors in the model, resulting in biased parameter estimates. Although it is expected that the incorporation of microbiological results would reduce such a bias, caution is required when interpreting the estimated coefficients as causal measures of association. However, since the estimated coefficients were used to assign relative score weights, not to quantify causal associations, the method is acceptable for this application. The second source of bias arises from the pair-matched design of original study, which may have caused the sampled controls to be more similar to the cases and not representative of the referent population of all healthy calves on the facility. The CLR models account for the artificial similarities between cases and controls, but the ROC analysis used to select the optimal cut-points does not. Further research is needed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all three presented BRD scoring systems. Diagnostic methods such as thoracic ultrasound, auscultation, and hematology should be used to diagnose BRD in calves and estimate the sensitivity and specificity. While the methods listed are not gold-standards for BRD diagnosis, methods of estimating test sensitivity and specificity using imperfect tests have been described (En\u00f8e, Georgiadis & Johnson, 2000) . Furthermore, any proposed scoring systems should be validated using an independent data set.",

While multiple subtypes of BCoV in cattle have been described, including respiratory and enteric calf diarrhea subtypes, based on the clinical presentation of infected cattle, no antigenic or genetic markers have been found to consistently differentiate the subtypes (Saif, 2010) . Previous research has also established that animals infected with either subtype will shed viral particles in nasal secretions (Cho et al., 2001a; Cho et al., 2001b; Hasoksuz et al., 2002) . Hence, the results of the BCoV PCR cannot be relied on to distinguish respiratory BCoV from enteric strains being shed from nasal mucosa. Inclusion of the BCoV term as a predictor did not significantly improve the fit of the model ( G 2 BRD1 = 0.51, p = 0.439; G 2 BRD2 = 0.10, p = 0.75; G 2 BRD3 = 0.10, p = 0.75) and did not meaningfully change the values of the other coefficients. Additionally, the role of BCoV in calf BRD is unclear. Experimentally, BCoV has been demonstrated to induce respiratory signs following oronasal inoculation in calves in some studies (Kapil et al., 1991; McNulty et al., 1984) and not in others (Reynolds et al., 1985; Saif et al., 1986) . Similarly, some observational studies have found significant associations between BCoV exposure and BRD (Storz et al., 2000) , while others were unable to detect an association between serologic evidence of exposure to BCoV and incidence of BRD (Martin et al., 1998; Plummer et al., 2004) .",

It is expected that the prevalence of persistently infected calves on this facility in 2011 was even lower due to the facility's selectivity of clients and the increased mortality of PI calves during the first few weeks of life. Since PCR assays for each calf were performed using material collected and stored in a single vial, the presence of positive results for BRSV and BCoV (both enveloped RNA viruses) would seem to indicate sample handling was also sufficient for BHV-1 and BVDV (enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, respectively) had they been present. The absence of BHV-1 and BVDV in this population, and subsequent omission of these viruses from the case definition algorithm, may limit the validity of the presented systems to detect cases of BRD in other populations where these pathogens may be more prevalent. Further studies in calves infected with BHV-1 and BVD viruses are required to validate the accuracy of the current scoring systems.",

This approach to S p values assignment was adapted from a method described previously (Segev et al., 2008) , which assigned S p values based on odds ratios (ORs) estimated by exponentiating logistic regression coefficients. This change was made because logistic regression models assume that the joint effects of variables relate to the odds of an outcome in a multiplicative, not additive, manner (Breslow & Day, 1980) . Therefore, the sum of the ORs as determined by multivariable logistic regression does not necessarily represent the OR of disease in an individual with multiple exposures compared to an individual with no exposures. Another method that determines S p values based on logistic regression coefficients instead of ORs has been described (Sullivan, Massaro & D'Agostino, 2004) ; however the pair-matched case-control design of the current study was incompatible with Sullivan's method.",

For ease of use, an investigator may assess the presence or absence of ocular discharge, nasal discharge, ear droop or head tilt, respiratory quality and spontaneous coughing. Calves with abnormal ear or head carriage, or calves with nasal discharge and one other clinical sign, or calves that have any three clinical signs are BRD cases based on the BRD3 scoring system. Only calves with nasal discharge or calves with two other clinical signs (spontaneous coughing, ocular discharge or abnormal respiratory) would require handling the calf to measure its rectal temperature and confirm BRD status if the temperature is \u226539.2 \u2022 C or 102.5 \u2022 F.",
