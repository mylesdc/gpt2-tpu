Random telephone numbers were selected from up-to-date telephone directories. Telephone surveys have been used in a number of SARS and avian influenza studies [11] [12] [13] [14] . Telephone calls were made by trained interviewers from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM each night to avoid over-representation of unemployed persons. For unanswered calls, at least 3 other independent calls were made. The household member whose birthday was closest to the date of the interview was invited to join the study. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the respondents and ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The response rate, defined as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible households, was approximately 57%.",

In Hong Kong, however, almost all households have telephones [28] and a large number of local published studies on SARS [11] and avian influenza [11, 13, 14] have utilized this method. Second, the response rate of the study was not very high. Nevertheless, the response rate was similar to many of other published local studies [14, 28, 29] . with the distributions of 18-39 and 40-60 year age groups being very comparable to those obtained from the Census data (49.6% and 50.4%, respectively). The study's gender distribution was also comparable to the Census distributions (47.8% male and 52.0% female) [30] . Adoption of behavioral responses was self-reported and had not been validated. However, during this pre-outbreak stage, it is unlikely that social desirability strongly biased the reporting of these behaviors.",

It is less clear whether populations which were relatively unaffected by SARS and populations that demonstrated less frequent face mask use and other relevant public health measures would exhibit the same magnitude of intended behavioral responses as the population of Hong Kong. Cultural and perceptions factors (such as perceived efficacy of prevention means) would also result in different prevalence of behavioral responses. International comparisons are therefore also greatly warranted.",

The magnitude of these behavioral responses may be even greater than those witnessed during the SARS epidemic and would be likely to increase if a high fatality rate or high infectivity rate were reported. These preventive behaviors may be an effective firewall to the continued spread of the virus in the community. Surveillance of public responses is an integral part of the government's H5N1 preparedness plan. It should address issues related to the potentially underestimated fatality associated with human H5N1 cases. Surveillance should also closely monitor prevalence of important public health behaviors such as quarantine compliance and cross-border preventive measures. Up-to-date surveillance information is necessary for the government to implement and make rapid adjustments these public health measures.",
