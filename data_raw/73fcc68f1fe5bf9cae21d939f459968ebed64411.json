Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3 0 end by 3 0 -terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3 0 -terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3 0 end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.",

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses microRNA-122 (miR-122) as a proviral host factor to increase viral genome abundance, but HCV infection results in diminished miR-122 levels by unknown mechanisms. We PLOS Pathogens | demonstrated that the HCV core protein plays a role in reprogramming the cellular profile of miR-122 isomers by inhibiting GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, to promote miR-122 destabilization. Our results raise several important questions. First, how is only a specific subset of miRNAs in the liver affected by GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein? Second, how does HCV regulate pre-miR-122 processing in its loop region? Third, does GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein affect the translation of a specific group of host mRNAs? With many unanswered questions, our results propose a novel feedback regulatory mechanism for controlling HCV RNA abundance by the viral capsid protein, which is capable of modulating miR-122 activity and stability through the inhibition of GLD-2.

Among diverse miRNA [578 (for HCV-2) to 775 (for HCV-3) species identified by aligning the reads to 1,080 prototype miR-NAs in the miRNA database] expressed in human liver tissues, miR-122 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA. We detected various miR-122 species in the range of 16 to 25 nucleotide (nt) in length (S3 Table) . Because miR-122 isomers of 21, 22, and 23 nt in length are three prominent species, which were detectable by northern blot analysis of total RNA from Huh7 cells and primary hepatocytes (S2A and S2C Fig) , and other individual isomers comprised <2% of the total read counts of all forms of miR-122 species (with a read frequency of >50 reads per million) in biopsies, we focused on these three isomers for further sequence analysis.",

As shown in Fig 3A, there was a >2-fold increase in the proportion of the 21-nt miR-122 isomer compared with that in the normal liver N-1. In contrast, the proportion of the 23-nt isomer dramatically decreased, whereas the ratio for the 22-nt miR-22 prototype species only slightly decreased. The 23-nt isomer, including five different species, had either a templated nucleotide [i.e., the 3 0 -end U residue derived from precursor miR122 (pre-miR-122); Fig 3B, top shows the partial primary miR-122 (pri-miR-122) secondary structure and sequence] or a non-templated nucleotide (i.e., isomers bearing a dinucleotide of 3 0 -GA, 3 0 -GG, and 3 0 -GC in the 23-nt isomer in which the penultimate G is derived from a template or a 3 0 -AU dinucleotide; underlined sequences represent non-templated additions) at their 3 0 ends. In addition to the 3 0 -end mono-adenylated isomer, we could also detect miR-122 isomers carrying a 3 0 -mono-G or -C tail in the liver biopsies, but these isomers represented <0.2% of the total read counts of all miR-122 species (S3 Table) . In fact, isomer profile analysis for the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the liver biopsies revealed that all miRNAs bear a single 3 0 terminal non-templated or templated nucleotide (any of four ribonucleotide residues) with adenylate and uridylate being two major terminal nucleotides (S3 Fig) .",

            "text": "Having found that HCV infection interferes with miR-122 3 0 -end tailing in liver tissues, we investigated whether the HCV core protein inhibits this modification. miRNA tailing can be catalyzed by various nucleotidyl transferases including non-canonical poly(A) polymerases and terminal uridylyl transferases. We silenced each of a series of known terminal nucleotidyl transferases using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and found that miR-122 abundance is specifically regulated by GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase [29] [also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 2 (TUTase-2)] ( Fig 4A) . Silencing of GLD-2 expression with increasing doses of siRNA (Fig 4B) , which was not associated with a substantial cell viability decrease (Fig 4C) , decreased the cellular abundance of three major miR-122 isomers (21-, 22-, and 23-nt isomers) (Fig 4D) , resulting in an overall 49% decrease in their miRNA levels and consequent decreases in HCV subgenomic RNA and viral protein (NS3 and Non-templated nucleotide addition to the 3 0 end of miR-122 is suppressed in liver tissue from patients with HCV and in Huh7 cells expressing HCV core protein or infected with HCV. (A) Analysis of miR-122 isomers identified by the deep sequencing of small RNA libraries from human liver biopsies. Fold change (log2) of the proportion of each miR-122 isomer (each isomer read count divided by the total count of miR-122 isomers) in the indicated specimens compared with the corresponding value in the normal liver tissue (N-1). (B) Fold-change analysis for the 23-nt isomers as described in (A). Isomers are sorted according to their 3 0 -end dinucleotide sequences. Presented at the top is the pri-miR-122 sequence showing processing sites (blue arrows) for the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and an aberrant 3 0 -terminal processing site (black arrow) for the 23-nt isomer bearing a template-derived 3 0 GU-tail.

(D) Proportions of four major miR-122 isomers in Huh7 cells transiently expressing HCV core protein (Core) or infected with HCV. NS5B) levels ( Fig 4B and 4D ). As observed in GLD-2 knock-downed cells, the 23-nt miR-122 isomers as well as the two other major isomers (21-nt and 22-nt species) concurrently decreased both in Huh7 cells transiently expressing the core protein and in HCV-infected cells (S2A and S2B Fig) , suggesting that the miR-122 level reduction does not occur in a step-bystep manner in the order of decreasing length of isomers. Furthermore, when the core protein was expressed in GLD-2 knock-downed cells, miR-122 levels decreased further (Fig 4E, see the cells treated with 1 or 5 nM siGLD-2). However, when GLD-2 expression was substantially silenced with higher concentrations of siRNA, this inhibitory effect of core protein was diminished, suggesting that miR-122 level regulation by core protein is a GLD-2-dependent event. Because miR-122 abundance was specifically regulated by GLD-2 silencing and the miR-122 isomers' 3 0 end was found to carry four different single ribonucleotides, we assessed the possibility that GLD-2 adds ribonucleotides other than adenylate to the 3 0 end of miR-122 and sought to test whether GLD-2 catalytic activity is inhibited by the HCV core protein. We addressed these questions using highly purified recombinant GLD-2 and core proteins ( Fig  5A) . Initially, we tested the adenylation activity of the purified recombinant GLD-2 with an N-terminal histidine tag and found that wild-type GLD-2, but not its inactive form GLD-2 (D215A), monoadenylates miR-122-5p ( Fig 5B) . This result was unexpected because GLD-2 was originally identified as a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that acts on certain mRNAs [29, 30] but was consistent with previous studies illustrating GLD-2-mediated miR-122 3 0 adenylation [19, 31] . Importantly, we found that GLD-2 was capable of adding any of the four ribonucleotides to the miR-122 3 0 end with almost similar efficiency ( Fig 5C) . Similarly, GLD-2 added any of four ribonucleotides to the 3 0 end of eight other miRNAs (S5A Fig) randomly selected from the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in human liver, with different efficiencies (S5B Fig) . Surprisingly, miR-122-5-p was most efficiently modified by GLD-2. Further analysis of GLD-2 template specificity using ribonucleotide homopolymers (20-nt) revealed that (A) 20 is the best template of GLD-2 for 3 0 -end adenylation, uridylation, guanylation, and cytidylation (S5C Fig). These findings suggest that GLD-2 has a certain degree of selectivity on small RNAs for 3 0 end modification. Using the miR-122-5p that was most efficiently adenylated by GLD-2, we revealed that the HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2's 3 0 -end monoadenylation activity, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS--CoV) capsid protein had little effect on GLD-2 activity (Fig 5D) .",

This result suggests that miR-122 level regulation was not mediated through Ago2-core protein interactions.

In contrast, other truncation mutants [GFP-C(1-75), GFP-C(1-121), and GFP-C(1-173)], which translocated to the nucleus, failed to decrease miR-122 levels ( Fig 6C and 6D ), indicating that GLD-2 inhibition-mediated miR-122 expression regulation by the core protein is a cytoplasmic process. These results also indicate that the RNA-binding activity of the core protein is not involved in this regulation because GFP-C(76-191) and GFP-C(99-191), lacking the known RNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-75) [34] , did also reduce miR-122 levels. GFP-C(151-191), in which 52 amino acids was further deleted from GFP-C(99-191) and thus lacks the most of the domain 2 of HCV core protein known to be required for its lipid droplet association [35] , failed to decrease miR-122 level (Fig 6E) . This mutant showed a weaker affinity to GLD-2 as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig 6F) . More importantly, this deletion mutant was barely colocalized with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm, whereas GFP-C(1-191) and core protein expressed in Huh7 cells by transfection of HCV RNA colocalzied with GLD-2 in the perinuclear regions and lipid droplet-like structures (Fig 6G) . HCV RNA (JFH-1 in vitro transcripts)-transfected Huh7 cells showed enhanced colocalization of the core protein with GLD-2 compared with the cells expressing the GFP-fused core protein alone, suggesting that core protein-GLD-2 interaction in cells might be affected by viral protein expression and/or viral genome replication.",

Similarly, these miR-122 isomers were more effective in enhancing HCV IRES-mediated translation compared with the shorter forms of miR-122, the 21-and 22-nt isomers (Fig 7B) . We found that the single nucleotide-extended miR-122 isomers displayed improved stability compared with the 22-nt isomer when their cellular stability was assessed by northern blot analysis for the residual amounts of miR-122-5p following the incubation of individual duplex miRNAs in HeLa cell extracts (Fig 7C) . These results demonstrate that miR-122 isomers modified by GLD-2-mediated 3 0 non-templated addition display increased miRNA activity and stability, implying that GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein promotes miR-122 destabilization to dysregulate its functions in the liver and in the HCV life cycle.

            "text": "Inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Deep sequencing analysis of small RNAs from liver biopsies revealed that among the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in liver tissues, only six miRNAs exhibited a decrease in their 3 0 -end monoadenylated isomer levels upon HCV infection. The cellular abundance of these miRNAs was diverse (S3A Fig), suggesting that the selection of the miRNA template does not appear to be determined by the abundance of miRNAs alone. Instead, there might be a certain template specificity for GLD-2. However, the six miRNAs did not have any conserved sequences (S4A Fig). GLD-2 has no known RNA-binding motif [29, 30] . Thus, it is recruited by the phosphorylated CPEB/CPSF complex to the 3 0 -UTR of target mRNAs for cytoplasmic poly (A) addition [36] . Similarly, in a cellular context, helper protein might also govern GLD-2 specificity toward miR-122. Notably, the miRNA species, for which the adenylated isomer levels were decreased by HCV infection, were not perfectly matched to the GLD-2 depletion-sensitive (in terms of stability) miRNAs in human fibroblasts [19] . Thus, the type of miRNAs post-transcriptionally modified by GLD-2 might be determined by cell-type specific cofactors used by GLD-2 to recognize a specific set of miRNAs. Nevertheless, GLD-2 appears to a higher affinity for miR-122-5p preferentially for mono-ribonucleotide addition to its 3 0 -end compared with either other liver resident miRNAs we tested (S5B Fig) . Surprisingly, GLD-2 displayed a much higher terminal transferase activity on 20-mer homopolymer (A) than other homopolymeric RNA templates (S5C Fig). These results suggested that miRNA sequence and/or structure might also important determinants for GLD-2 template selectivity.",

            "text": "Given that miR-122 is a specific template of GLD-2, one important question is whether the non-templated addition of all four different nucleotides to miR-122 is catalyzed by GLD-2 alone. An early study claimed that C. elegans GLD-2 from reticulocyte lysates programmed with a plasmid encoding GLD-2 exhibited a strict ATP dependency on a C 35 A 10 substrate [29] . GLD-2 monoadenlyation activity on miR-122 was also previously demonstrated with an immunoprecipitated mouse GLD-2 [19, 31] and a recombinant GDL-2 fused to the C-terminal end of GST [19] . Interestingly, the GST-fused GLD-2 used in the latter study displayed a weak preference for ATP over UTP on miR-122. Our terminal nucleotidyl transferase assays conducted using His-tagged recombinant GLD-2 revealed that any of the four ribonucleotides can be added to the 3 0 -end of miR-122 without preference for ATP (Fig 5C) , raising the possibility that the non-templated additions of all four different nucleotides to the miR-122 3 0 end might be catalyzed by GLD-2. Supporting this hypothesis, we detected the 23-nt miR-122 isomers modified by the non-templated addition of a single A, G, or C residue in five different liver biopsies analyzed. The ability of GLD-2 to use UTP and ATP as a substrate was also observed in the 24-nt isomers in which the U-tailed 23-nt isomer (it can be derived by the non-templated addition or aberrant processing of pre-miR-122) was further extended by the addition of a single uridylate or adenylate residue. Owing to the high abundance of miR-122 in the liver, the analysis of our small RNA sequencing datasets enabled us to identify previously uncovered 24-nt miR-122 species that carry a dinucleotide (AA and AU; all represent non-templated nucleotides that always start with A) or a 25-nt species bearing a triple nucleotide sequence (UUU; underlined sequences represent non-templated nucleotides). In these miR-122 species, the non-templated addition of uridylate residues was repeatedly observed. These results further suggest that GLD-2 may have an intrinsic capability of using diverse nucleotides as substrates. If consistent with the in vitro findings for GLD-2, the inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein would lower the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing any single non-templated nucleotides at their 3 0 ends. Indeed, the read frequency of all of the abovementioned miR-122 species was substantially decreased in liver biopsies from patients with HCV (S3 Table) . A study illustrated that the Zcchc11-dependent uridylation of miR-26a and 26b attenuates miRNA-target repression [37] . However, uridylation of miR-122 enhanced its stability and miRNA activity, highlighting the importance of the fine regulation of miRNA 3 0 -end modification for executing the optimal functions of individual miRNAs. Finally, it should be stated that there was a substantial decrease in the proportion of the single U-tailed abundantly present 23-nt miR-122 isomer (aberrantly processed or terminally modified one), suggesting that pre-miR-122 processing in its single-stranded loop region might also be influenced by HCV infection (30%-33% of 22-nt canonical miR-122 in normal liver versus 14%-18% in patient liver biopsies). This interesting issue is currently under further investigation.",

            "text": "In addition to its role as a structural protein, the HCV core protein is also known to be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [38] . The tumor suppressor activity of miR-122 is well characterized in cells and miR-122 knockout mice [12] [13] [14] [15] . Thus, our results imply that the HCV core protein may contribute to liver cancer development by decreasing miR-122 levels. Decreased miR-122 expression resulting from core protein expression during the course of chronic HCV infection may in part explain the oncogenic phenotype previously observed in cell culture and transgenic mice expressing the core protein [38] . Furthermore, the core protein-expressing transgenic mice and miR-122 knockout mice both are characterized by hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, followed by the development of hepatocellular carcinoma with age, further supporting the role of the core protein in liver diseases through its ability to promote miR-122 destabilization by inhibiting GLD-2. Studies have suggested that let-7i-5p and miR-29a-3p act as tumor suppressors because of their ability to repress oncogenes [39, 40] . It remains to be investigated whether the functions of these anti-cancer miRNAs are regulated by alteration in their 3 0 -end modification as observed in liver biopsies from patients with HCV ( S4 Fig). If this is confirmed, GLD-2 inhibition by the core protein can be one of the mechanisms accelerating tumor development by chronic HCV infection through a previously uncovered pathway. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that GLD-2 is downregulated in several cancers, as revealed by a gene expression meta-analysis [41] , implying that the loss of GLD-2 could be involved in carcinogenesis.",

So, what might be the consequence of GLD-2 inhibition by the core protein? We can speculate that cytoplasmic poly (A) addition to some host mRNAs 3 0 -UTR can be inhibited by the HCV core protein. Inhibition of host translation by virus infection is mediated by the inactivation of translation initiation factor 2 through its phosphorylation by PKR, a type I interferon inducible gene [43] . Because many viruses, including HCV, suppress or abrogate the type I interferon signaling pathway and PKR activation by diverse mechanisms [44] , whereas subgroups of host mRNAs are yet subjected to down-regulation, it is tempting to speculate that GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein affects host mRNA translation. It remains to be characterized what host mRNAs are subjected to this regulation to understand the impact of the chronic inhibition of GLD-2 in liver pathophysiology.",

The beneficial effect of miR-122 in HCV replication and translation can be repressed by the accumulation of the core protein, which determines the degree to which the host supports viral replication and thus plays a role in establishing persistent infection. Suppressing miR-122 levels in addition to sequestering of miR-122 by the HCV genome as reported recently [45] might be viral strategies to control viral titers. These miR-122 suppressing effect would also contribute in promoting liver diseases and cancer development.",

After mapping, only unique reads of \"mapped\" dataset were annotated using the miRBase database (release 19) (http://www.mirbase.org) for miRNA [56] ; the Rfam database (release 11) (http://rfam. xfam.org) for rRNA, various noncoding small RNAs, and repeat sequences [57] ; and the genomic tRNA database (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/Hsapi19/) [58] . Individual mapped sequence reads were compiled into a set of unique sequences with the read counts for each sequence reflecting the relative abundance. The unique sequence read counts were normalized to the total read counts of the \"mapped\" dataset in millions to give reads per million.",

P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. most abundant miRNAs present in the liver, with uridylation and adenylation being two major modification events. Shown are the percentages of the read count of 3 0 -terminally single nucleotide-tailed isomers compared with the total read count of each miRNA's major isomers, which include an isomer with a 3 0 -end 1-nt deletion, prototype miRNAs, and miRNAs bearing a 3 0 -terminal single nucleotide tail. N-1 and N-2 denote liver biopsies from healthy controls, and HCV-1 to HCV-3 are liver biopsies from patients with HCV. The numbers above or below the bars indicate the estimated mean value of the proportion for each isomer. miRNA isomers are grouped according to the tail sequence at the 3 0 end of individual isomers, which can be either derived from a precursor by aberrant processing and/or by non-templated addition (red symbols) or solely by non-templated addition (black symbols). Via miRNA isomer profile analysis for the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in liver biopsies, we discovered that these 50 miRNAs, including miR-122, are modified via a non-templated or templated 3 0 addition of any of four ribonucleotide residues. The analyzed miRNAs frequently contained a single adenylate or uridylate residue rather than guanylate or cytidylate residues. The average frequencies of mono-U, mono-A, mono-G, and mono-C addition were 12.97%, 9.83%, 2.88%, and 4.07% (when accounting for both templated and non-templated additions), respectively, in the normal liver tissue (N-1). The ratios for mono-G and mono-C additions for these miRNAs were relatively low when considering only non-templated addition. Similar profiles were also observed with another normal liver biopsy N-2 and liver biopsy samples from patients with HCV. These results reveal that miRNA 3 0 -end modification occurs frequently in liver-resident miRNAs with non-templated monoadenylation and monouridylation being two major modification processes.

Fold change in the proportion of 3 0 -end mono-A (A), mono-U (B), mono-G (C), and mono-C (D)-tailed miRNA isomers in liver samples from patients with HCV (HCV-1 to HCV-3, red symbols) compared with the healthy controls (N-1 and N-2, black symbols). Shown are the values for the top 50 most abundant miRNAs present in liver biopsies. miRNAs on the x-axis (starting from miR-122-5p) are in the order of their abundance in liver biopsies. The miRNAs highlighted in red on the x-axis represent those exhibiting >25% decreases in the proportion of the indicated 3 0 -tailed miRNA isomers in the patient liver biopsies. In (B), the miRNAs highlighted in blue represent those carrying the 3 0 U-tail that is also found in the precursor miRNA. Having found that HCV infection decreases the proportion of miR-122 isomers with a mononucleotide tail (see Fig 3B) , we asked whether HCV infection also reprograms the isomer profiles of other liver-resident miRNAs. Further analysis of small RNA sequencing datasets revealed that HCV infection changed the ratios of the mono-A-or mono-U-tailed isomers in a specific set of miRNAs among the top 50 most abundant miRNAs in the liver. The cellular levels of miRNA isomers modified by 3 0 -end monoadenylation or monouridylation were reduced by >25% upon HCV infection only in a limited number of miRNAs. In only six miR-NAs carrying either a single non-templated adenylate residue (miR-122-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-186-5p, miR-30b-5p, and miR-29a-3p) or a single uridylate residue (miR-122-5p, let-7a-5p, and let-7g-5p have a 3 0 -end single uridylate residue that is either derived from their precursor forms or added in a non-template-dependent manner; let-7f-5p miR-26a-5p and miR-151a-5p have a non-templated uridylate residue), we observed decreases in their proportions in liver biopsies from patients with HCV. Notably, among these miRNAs, only miR-122 displayed >50% decreases regarding the proportions of all isomers modified by single nucleotide additions. ",
