This is similar to Hong Kong but different from temperate countries where the highest rates occurred in the 6-to 23-month-age-group. [10] [11] [12] Patients who were \u22646 weeks or <3 months old were likely admitted for neonatal or infantile pyrexia workup, this can explain the high UTI rates and antibiotic usage in this age-group. At the average rate of 881.68 per 10 5 population for <6 months old, it is higher than temperate countries. 3, 13 This could be due to all year-round influenza with bimodal peaks, similar to Malaysia. 14 Studies have shown that maternal influenza vaccination can prevent influenza in infants; therefore, pregnant women should receive influenza vaccination to protect their infants. 15, 16 The age-group 6 month to <5 years was the largest cohort (54%) with the second-highest hospitalization rate and the highest complication rate (30.6%) especially neurologic, similar to another study. 17 In other studies, the age-group 6-35 months or the lowest agegroups had the highest incidence of complications. 11, 18, 19 However, the \u226510-year-old-age-group had the highest other complications, ICU/high-dependency admissions, and influenza B Victoria rates. This is unlike other studies which had higher ICU admissions in the youngest age-groups <12 months. 20 Abbreviation: SD, standard deviation. especially pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. 11, 16 ",

Acute seizures contributed 42.4% of neurological complications, similar to other studies with rates of 55%-78%.20,24 In two published studies, encephalitis, encephalopathy, and febrile seizures constituted 0.6%-4.4% of influenza admissions, whereas these constituted 10.3% of our admissions.16,20 In a study of influenza vaccine uptake, only 51% and 46% of physicians recognized epilepsy and intellectual disability as high-risk conditions.25 Physicians should routinely offer influenza vaccination to patients with a prior seizure disorder, neurologic conditions or developmental delay.26,27 In our cohort, influenza A comprised 76.9% and had higher complication rates especially neurologic. Influenza B contributed to 23.1% of all admissions in 2013-2014; this is similar to the 19.3% rate for Singapore in 2007-2012.26 The older age-groups \u22655 years old had higher proportions of influenza B compared to the younger age-groups. This is similar to previous publications which showed that those aged \u22655 years were more likely to have influenza B but different from Hong Kong where the 2-to 4-year-age-group had the highest influenza B hospitalization rates.10,21,27 In 2013-2014, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine was not yet available; the trivalent vaccine would not have covered 5.7% of all strains and up to 10.8% of strains in those \u226510 years. Comparing the two subtypes of influenza A, H3N2 had higher rates of febrile seizures, bacterial pneumonia and lower rates of diarrhea compared to H1N1 pdm2009 (P = .008, .03, .02, respectively). There was no difference in clinical characteristics or severity between the two influenza B lineages, similar to a study from Guangzhou, China.28 In terms of seasonality, influenza A peaks were mainly driven by H3N2 which were more intense and earlier except in mid-2014, when H1N1 pdm09 and influenza B peaked in June. This is similar to the H3N2 patterns in Shenzhen and Hong Kong in 2012-2013.29 The predominant lineage for influenza B was Yamagata in both years, similar to that of Malaysia.30 One limitation of our study was that IF was the main mode of testing, which could lead to an underestimate of the true incidence of influenza hospitalization as PCR is a more sensitive method of testing. However, more severe cases could have been included in this study due to the higher viral burden in respiratory secretions detectable by IF rather than PCR. Obesity was likely under-reported as only 55% of patients had their height taken, thereby leading to an omission of BMI used to determine obesity status. Another limitation was the lack of information of prior influenza vaccination; however, uptake for influenza vaccination in children has generally been poor. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for children under 5 years of age or those with underlying high-risk factors, it is not in the national immunization schedule for children and therefore not routinely offered. As this was a hospital-based study, the observations may have been confounded by the admitting threshold with younger aged children more likely to be admitted. Prior influenza infections would not have been detected as influenza serological testing was not available. It is possible that older children may have had partial immunity to influenza A, not develop severe influenza A and instead be hospitalized for influenza B.",
