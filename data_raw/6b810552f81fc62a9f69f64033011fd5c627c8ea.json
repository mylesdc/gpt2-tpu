            "text": "Background: Betaretroviruses infect a wide range of species including primates, rodents, ruminants, and marsupials. They exist in both endogenous and exogenous forms and are implicated in animal diseases such as lung cancer in sheep, and in human disease, with members of the human endogenous retrovirus-K (HERV-K) group of endogenous betaretroviruses (\u03b2ERVs) associated with human cancers and autoimmune diseases. To improve our understanding of betaretroviruses in an evolutionarily distinct host species, we characterized \u03b2ERVs present in the genomes and transcriptomes of mega-and microbats, which are an important reservoir of emerging viruses. Results: A diverse range of full-length \u03b2ERVs were discovered in mega-and microbat genomes and transcriptomes including the first identified intact endogenous retrovirus in a bat. Our analysis revealed that the genus Betaretrovirus can be divided into eight distinct sub-groups with evidence of cross-species transmission. Betaretroviruses are revealed to be a complex retrovirus group, within which one sub-group has evolved from complex to simple genomic organization through the acquisition of an env gene from the genus Gammaretrovirus. Molecular dating suggests that bats have contended with betaretroviral infections for over 30 million years. Conclusions: Our study reveals that a diverse range of betaretroviruses have circulated in bats for most of their evolutionary history, and cluster with extant betaretroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages suggesting that their distribution may be largely unrestricted by host species barriers. The presence of \u03b2ERVs with the ability to transcribe active viral elements in a major animal reservoir for viral pathogens has potential implications for public health.",

In addition to the existence of infectious viral particles that are horizontally transmitted between hosts (exogenous retroviruses), the capacity of retroviruses to integrate into the host germline also generates vertically transmissible endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) [1, 2] . ERVs may or may not be capable of producing infectious viral particles, and germline integration over the course of multiple generations typically leads to the accumulation of mutations that render them defective and non-functional [2] .",

Among the exogenous, infectious members of the genus are the Type B Mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), the Type D Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which causes pulmonary carcinoma in sheep, and the Type D Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) which causes wasting and immunosuppression in new-born Rhesus monkeys [11] [12] [13] . All betaretroviruses utilize variants of the lysine tRNA primer binding site (PBS) and encode a deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), within their pro gene which functions as a nucleocapsid-dUTPase fusion protein [14] [15] [16] . Type B and Type D betaretroviruses differ in several respects including their complement of accessory factors, virion morphology, strategies for RNA nuclear export, and the length of their LTR regions. Type B betaretroviruses contain spherical viral cores and have LTRs of~1,200 nucleotides while Type D contain cylindrical viral cores and have LTRs of~300 nucleotides. The prototypical Type B betaretrovirus, MMTV, encodes the accessory proteins regulator of export of MMTV mRNA (Rem) and negative acting factor (Naf ), which have roles in viral mRNA export, protein synthesis and gene expression [17] [18] [19] , in addition to the virulence factor, superantigen (Sag) [20] . The Type D retrovirus JSRV has been shown to encode the trans-acting factor Rej which has a role in protein synthesis and may assist RNA nuclear export [21] . While no distinct oncogenes or Sag-like virulence-associated proteins are known to be encoded by Type D betaretroviruses, the Env protein of JSRV is associated with oncogenesis [13, 14] .",

As such, their existence serves as an indication of the potential host range of a given retroviral lineage and may be interpreted as evidence for the possible existence of exogenous retroviruses that have yet to be isolated. Indeed, previous studies have reported a number of endogenous betaretroviruses (\u03b2ERVs) in species for which no exogenous betaretrovirus has yet been identified. These include mammalian species as diverse as primates, horses, rats, lemurs, and an Australian marsupial, the common brushtail possum [25] [26] [27] .",

As a point of reference, the nucleotide sequence lengths of MPMV gag, pol, and env are 1,974, 2,583, and 1,758, respectively, while the majority of the transcripts identified in the BLAST analyses were <1,000. The P. alecto transcriptome was found to contain two retroviral transcripts 5,433 and 5,830 nucleotides in length which overlap each other by 3,152 bases with 100% sequence identity. The extent of overlap and perfect identity indicated that the two sequences likely represented a fulllength retroviral genomic sequence >8,103 bases in length that was later determined through phylogenetic analysis to be a \u03b2ERV. This full-length P. alecto \u03b2ERV genomic transcript was named PaERV-\u03b2A (Pteropus alecto Endogenous Retrovirus -betaretrovirus A) ( Figure 1 ).

While the M. lucifugus genome sequencing coverage was relatively high (7\u00d7 coverage), the P. vampyrus genome has only been sequenced to 2.6x coverage. The nature of a low-coverage genome such as this means that within the assembled 'scaffolds' there occasionally exist stretches of nucleotides of ambiguous identity. In this regard, several of the bat \u03b2ERVs reported herein contain short 'non-sequenced regions' (NSR) ( Table 2) .

To confirm this observation we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of the Env sequences of known gammaretroviruses and betaretroviruses, together with the newly identified \u03b2ERV Env sequences ( Figure 3 ). This analysis confirmed previous observations [12, 38] that the Env sequences of some extant Type D betaretroviruses, namely MPMV, SMR and simian retrovirus serotypes 1 and 4 (SRV1 and SRV4), cluster with gammaretroviral Env, as do those of PvERV-\u03b2J, K, PaERV-\u03b2A, PaEnv-01 (Env sequence derived from P. alecto), and RfEnv-01 (Env sequence derived from R. ferrumequinum). Other Type D retroviruses such as JSRV and the enzoonotic nasal tumor viruses (ENTV) of sheep and goats did not fall into this cluster.

Furthermore, the differential use of tRNA Lys 1,2 and tRNA Lys 3 was not found to be restricted to either Type B or Type D betaretroviruses. Rather, it appears that a switch between the two has occurred multiple times throughout the history of the genus. This diversity of genomic organization was used in conjunction with the phylogenetic analyses of Gag, Pol, and Env (with prime consideration given to the highly conserved Pol phylogeny) and the tRNA usage to identify eight distinct groups within the Betaretrovirus genus ( Figure 4 ). The eight betaretroviral subgroups that we propose are distinguished from each other by major evolutionary differences such as deep phylogenetic divergence with strong bootstrap support (>90% of trees resolving the clade), significant mutations in key genetic features such as a switch to the use of a different PBS, or the presence of retroviral genes from a different genus.",

A nucleotide sequence alignment of the extreme 3\u2032 region (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ) of the closely related PvERV-\u03b2J, K, and PaERV-\u03b2A generated a consensus sequence that contained this ORF and revealed that the equivalent ORF sequences in PvERV-\u03b2K and PaERV-\u03b2A are respectively interrupted by a frameshifting deletion mutation and stop mutation. This ORF contains a possible start methionine that would generate a 90 amino acid protein. This alignment also indicated that the alternative ORF* in PaERV-\u03b2A (Figure 1 ) was likely to be an artifact as the U3 region contained an eight nucleotide insertion that disrupts a stop codon which, if the insertion did occur after integration, has generated an artificial ORF.

However, many retroviral accessory and regulatory genes, such as rec and np9 of HERV-K and vpr and tat of HIV-1, are shorter than 100 codons and are often encoded over the span of two exons. Despite the high minimum cut-off, it is striking that the bat \u03b2ERVs possessed a diverse array of additional ORFs. While we cannot confirm that these are indeed protein coding domains, much less speculate on their function, the existence of similar elements is not without precedent among the betaretroviruses. One example is the 'ORF x' of JSRV, the function of which is unknown but it has been found to be broadly conserved amongst JSRV isolates [45] . Several of the ORFs we identified overlap the proviral LTRs, which consist of typically untranslated regions. This is also not unprecedented, with a prime example being the sag gene of the betaretrovirus MMTV, which is situated entirely within the U3 region of the 3\u2032 LTR. The presence of unique ORFs in \u03b2ERVs may indicate the evolution of novel retroviral genes whose products have regulatory or accessory functions required for the retroviral life-cycle and/or pathogenesis. In addition to the \u03b2ERVs reported in this study we noted the presence in both mega-and microbats of betaretrovirus-like retroelements that resemble \u03b2ERVs but lack the env gene; these were not investigated further (data not shown). We reported each \u03b2ERV as a distinct entity. Nevertheless it is reasonable that some of their number, particularly the \u03b2ERVs within each of groups VII and VIII, represent a common progenitor infectious betaretrovirus that has undergone duplication events via retrotransposition or recombination since an original, single integration event. For example, the integration time of PvERV-\u03b2J coupled with its similarity to PaERV-\u03b2A and PvERV-\u03b2K may mean that these \u03b2ERVs originated from a single integration into the genome of the common ancestor of P. vampyrus and P. alecto and that at least a single duplication event has occurred within P. vampyrus (or the common ancestor). However, it is also arguable that multiple integrations of closely related infectious retroviruses separated from each other by perhaps a small number of infectivity cycles occurred. We attempted to address this question by a comparative analysis of the flanking genomic DNA located immediately up-and downstream of the proviruses and by identifying the TSD that border each provirus and arise as a by-product of the integration mechanism [46] . Unique TSD indicate distinct integration events. In the case of the group VIII \u03b2ERVs a TSD for PvERV-\u03b2K could not be identified as its 3\u2032 LTR appears to be truncated. This may indicate that it is a copy of PvERV-\u03b2J that has arisen through a chromosomal duplication event. This appears to be confirmed by the identification of genomic DNA bordering PvERV-\u03b2J that is homologous to genomic DNA flanking PvERV-\u03b2K. As PaERV-\u03b2A is a genomic transcript it does not contain TSD. In the case of group VII \u03b2ERVs all of the identifiable TSD differ from one another, indicating separate integration events. Additionally, no flanking genomic DNA homology was identified amongst the members of the group. Notably, both the phylogenetic and LTR analyses revealed a great diversity of \u03b2ERVs in bat genomes. Our molecular clock dating suggested that the earliest viral incorporation event occurred at approximately 36 mya which is older than the separation of the megabats and microbats studied (around 20 mya) [28] . In addition, it is clear that some of the \u03b2ERVs present in bat genomes were vertically transmitted from their ancestors; e.g. MlERV-\u03b2A and PvERV-\u03b2A are grouped together and are of similar age having been integrated approximately 30 mya. However, it is also the case that many of the bat \u03b2ERVs formed via independent viral invasion and incorporation as they have different phylogenetic positions as well as different estimated ages of integration.",

This prompted us to define eight sub-groups (Group I-VIII) within the genus that accounted for these fundamental differences in the context of phylogenetic divergences at the amino acid level of the core polyproteins.

However, this sequence contained large deletions, was missing the entire pro and pol genes, and only fragments of the gag and env genes remained. The partial Env of CpERV-\u03b25 most closely matched the Env of the betaretrovirus SMR and on that basis it was reported as a betaretroviral sequence. In this study, we report a series of complete \u03b2ERVs in mega-and microbat genomes representing the breadth of the genus Betaretrovirus. Although CpERV-\u03b25 does contain a lysine tRNA-specific PBS, without a pol gene to phylogenetically differentiate it or the presence of the characteristically betaretroviral dUTPase domain within pro, it cannot be known with certainty whether it is a group VIII betaretrovirus or a gammaretrovirus. The study by Ballie et al. [25] and a recent study by Anai et al. [47] both noted the similarity between the Env of Type C gammaretroviruses and some Type D betaretroviruses which was attributed to a likely recombination event. We have shown that the betaretroviruses, which possess a gammaretrovirus-like Env, form a single clade in both Gag and Pol phylogenies. This indicates that a single recombination event produced these group VIII betaretroviruses. Furthermore, the typical mammalian gammaretroviral use of tRNA proline and glycine-specific PBS and the absence of dUTPase domains from their pro genes [14] can be used to infer that the nature of the recombination event was the insertion of a Type C gammaretroviral env gene into a Type D betaretrovirus. Previous studies also determined a recombinatorial origin for the Type D env [12, 38] . However, this conclusion was reached prior to the sequencing of the genome of JSRV [48] , which does not possess a gammaretrovirus-like Env, and its subsequent classification as a Type D retrovirus. As such, it was hypothesized that it was this recombination event that gave rise to the Type D lineage of betaretroviruses [12, 38] . Our analysis aimed to provide a clarification of the differences between, within, and outside of the Type B and D groups of betaretroviruses. Accordingly, we suggest that the fundamental feature giving rise to the division between the Type B and D lineages may have been the use of different primer binding sites, not the possession or not of a Type C env gene, which appears to be a more recent and more significant lineage divergence within the Type D group.",

While manually determining amino acid sequences from genes that contain frameshift mutations is difficult, when the manual reconstruction is closely informed by the alignment of each translated frame against known betaretroviral polymerases, amino acid sequence reconstruction is a viable option. As such, our phylogenetic analyses differ from those undertaken previously in that they are based on amino acid sequence alignments, and our groupings are based on differences in the fundamental genomic features in addition to phylogenetic clustering. Tristem [49] reported on the identification and classification of the highly diverse endogenous retroviruses present in the human genome (HERVs) and suggested that tRNA PBS specificity, in addition to the polymerase phylogeny of endogenous retroviruses, should inform their classification. This is because even if the ERVs of a given species cluster together in phylogenies, the use of different tRNA PBS may be evidence of separate origins. Indeed, that study made the assumption that HERVs with alternative PBS homologies were derived from cross-species transmissions. With this in mind, we analyzed the PBS sequences of the identified \u03b2ERVs and used this information to aid and inform the delineation of our grouping scheme.",

The Type D betaretroviruses MPMV and SRV make use of the cis-acting CTE, which in the absence of a retroviral accessory protein, recruits cellular proteins to effect nuclear export of intron containing viral RNA [22, 23] . This apparent dichotomy has been complicated by recent lines of investigation that have found that i) MMTV likely possesses a second, Rem-independent mechanism for the export of singly-splice env mRNA [52] ; and ii) the Type D betaretrovirus JSRV contains both a CTE and a Rev-like protein, Rej, which while found to possess a primary function related to Gag synthesis, also enhances RNA export in some cell types [21, 53] . This indicates that betaretroviruses may make use of multiple export mechanisms, possibly providing some measure of redundancy to promote productive replication in different contexts.",

It was not surprising that some \u03b2ERVs were predicted to contain one motif but not the other, as random mutation since integration is expected to interfere with sequence-based motif prediction. It is also possible that the NES of some betaretroviral Rev-like proteins (such as is the case for HERV-K Rec) are encoded at the exon boundary and/or within a frame different to that used by env, making the prediction of NES from the Env protein sequence challenging. A number of \u03b2ERVs in group VII were found to contain retroviral Tap-binding motifs, defined as published [23] , implicating their use of the CTE:Tap export pathway. The presence of putative NLS and NES in some group VII \u03b2ERVs suggests that Rev-like elements may also be present.",

Such a lineage would only have remained viable if it either possessed an alternative mechanism for export, or never made use of a Rev/RRE equivalent export mechanism in the first place. That Rev-like proteins are widely distributed amongst the betaretroviruses suggests that it is not unreasonable that the progenitor of group VIII did possess a Rev-like protein. This possibility is supported by the existence of the Rej protein of JSRV, as JSRV clusters alongside group VIII in the Type D lineage.

With regard to the second possibility it is important to note that the mRNA nuclear export mechanism of gammaretroviruses has not been elucidated and the proposal of a CTE-like element remains hypothetical. However, this notion is supported by the observation that accessory proteins have not been reported for gammaretroviruses, expression of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA would require nuclear export, and that a CTE-like cisacting nuclear export element would necessarily be located in singly-spliced env mRNA. In either event, our analysis leads to the surprising implication that the betaretroviruses are part of a fundamentally complex retroviral genus and that one lineage, group VIII, has evolved through gene replacement into a simple retrovirus sub-group that does not possess any distinct accessory proteins or virulence factors.",

This hypothetical evolutionary history paints an interesting picture of a broad and diverse retroviral genus whose distribution may be largely unrestricted by host species barriers. The \u03b2ERV members of a number of groups are represented in hosts who are distantly related, such as group VIII, which contains host species from bats, primates, rodents, and marsupials. This suggests that cross-species transmission of betaretroviruses is a likely and common occurrence, such that betaretroviruses may be particularly adept at evading host defences. This possibility is intriguing, particularly in light of the wide array of additional ORFs found within the genus that hint at the existence of as yet undiscovered betaretroviral accessory and virulence factors; these could, for example, act as countermeasures to circumvent the action of host intracellular restriction factors that are known to act as barriers to cross-species transmission [54] . The wide distribution of diverse \u03b2ERVs in bats and rodents suggests that these two largest groups of mammals play a major role as both hosts and cross-species transmitters for betaretroviruses. Bats and rodents are globally distributed, appearing on all continents with the exception of Antarctica [30, 55] . As such it appears reasonable to postulate that they have both played a large role in the global spread and evolution of betaretroviruses.",

In many countries the practice of hunting bats as a source of consumable bushmeat is common [60] . These circumstances provide the opportunity for retroviral transmission between bats and humans.

Total RNA was isolated from the 12 pooled bat tissues using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. DNA was prepared from purified total RNA (2.5 \u03bcg per cDNA reaction) using the Evrogen MINT cDNA synthesis kit (CAT # SK001) but with a modified oligodT adapter primer containing the recognition sequence for GsuI (5\u2032 AGCAGTGGTATCAACG CAGAGT CTGGAG(T) 20 VN). The cDNA was normalized with a duplex specific nuclease (DSN) using a modification of the protocol described in the Evrogen Trimmer cDNA normalization kit (Cat # NK001). After the second limited PCR amplification (12 cycles) with the M2 primer, PCR buffer, primers and enzyme were removed using the Machery Nagel Nucleospin II kit. DNA was then digested overnight with GsuI to remove the 3\u2032 polyA tail adapter sequence so as to remove stretches of homopolymer Ts and As which can effect the 454 sequencing run due to cross-talk (homopolymer flash). Five micrograms of normalized amplified double stranded cDNA was purified using the Machery Nagel Nucleopsin kit with the selective removal of the GsuI digested 43 base pair (bp) 3\u2032polyA adapter sequence using a modification of the binding conditions. Library preparation for Roche 454 sequencing for the GS FLX platform was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd, St Lucia, Queensland with sequence output of 74 MB, 374,360 single-end reads with an average read length of 239 bp. CLC Genomics Workbench version 4.5.1 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark) was used to trim reads based on quality and to remove the Evrogen normalization primer sequence, Subsequent 337,805 reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench default settings and BLAST databases were prepared using either de novo assembled or trimmed unassembled reads. The gag, pol, and env genes of each genome sequence were translated into protein sequences using the CLC Main Workbench 6.6 (CLC Bio). To identify the transcripts of interest we used the tBLASTn function of the CLC Main Workbench incorporating the following parameters: BLOSUM62 matrix, word size = 3, E-values < 1\u00d710 -10 , gap costs of existence 11, extension 1, and low complexity filtered. To confirm that the transcripts identified were more similar to betaretroviruses than other retroviral genera we performed a reciprocal BLAST analysis of each transcript against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using the BLASTx function of the CLC Main Workbench with the following parameters: BLOSUM80 matrix, word size = 3, E-values < 1 \u00d7 10 -10 , gap costs of existence 10, extension 1, low complexity filtered, and limit by entrez query = Viruses. Annotated sequences of the full-length betaretroviral sequences included in the phylogenetic analyses (PaERV-\u03b2A, PaPol-01, PaEnv-01, and RfEnv-01) are included as Additional file 4.",

For this, divergence times of mega-and microbats were taken from the fossil record [28] and used to calibrate date estimates for the rest of the species tree, assuming an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock. All phylogenetic trees were inferred using the GTR substitution model and the Yule speciation prior, and the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. The estimated substitution rates were then used to calculate the age of each \u03b2ERV using the following formula: T=(D/R)/2, where T is the invasion time of each \u03b2ERV (million years), D is the number of differences per site among the both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 LTRs, and R is the genomic substitution rate (substitutions per site per year).",
