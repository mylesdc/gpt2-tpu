            "text": "DCV contains two open reading frames (ORF) that cover 88% of our reference DCV genome ( Figure 1 ). ORF1 codes for non-structural proteins and is cleaved into eight putative proteins, including the RNA dependant RNA polymerase, a protease-like protein (3C), helicase proteins, as well as DCV-1A that acts as a suppressor of antiviral RNAi [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . ORF2 codes for the four structural proteins that form the capsid. We examined whether SNPs that arose in parallel were more likely to be in coding regions and whether these SNPs were synonymous or non-synonymous. We found 52% of significantly parallel SNPs (counting both alleles separately at tri-allelic sites) in ORF1 were non-synonymous (17/33) compared to 51% of non-significant SNPs (181/358). In ORF2 we found 59% of significantly parallel SNPs were non-synonymous (16/27) compared to 50% non-significant SNPs (95/190). There was no difference in the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs that were significantly parallel compared to those nonsignificant SNPs (ORF1: Chi-sq = 2.18, df = 1, P = 0.14; ORF2: Chi-sq = 0.47, df = 1, P= 0.49; both ORFs combined: Chi-sq = 3.06, df = 1, P= 0.08). However, we note that even synonymous mutations may alter fitness in an RNA virus [9] . Figure S1 : Correlation between mean SNP frequency and distance from D. melanogaster. We calculated the mean frequency of SNPs across the viral genome for each host species and examined if viruses showed higher rates of molecular evolution with increasing distance from D. melanogaster; the host DCV was isolated from and naturally infects. We found no significant change in mean SNP frequency with distance from D. melanogaster (phylogenetic mixed model implemented in MCMCglmm package in R as in [1], correlation= 0.0006 (CIs= -0.0176, 0.0188). We examined if mean SNP frequency in a species was affected by viral population size. We used RNA viral load calculated by qRT-PCR as in [1] at passage 10 as a proxy for viral population size (viral load did not change significantly between passages 3 and 10). After correcting for phylogenetic effects of the host species, we found no significant relationship between mean SNP frequency and viral load (phylogenetic mixed model implemented in MCMCglmm package in R as in [1], correlation= -0.00006 (CIs= -0.00072, 0.00054).
