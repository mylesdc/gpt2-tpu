Although this might be due to age and sex differences in exposures to infected poultry or settings contaminated by infected poultry, the pattern differs markedly from H5N1 cases, and would also be consistent with age-dependent biological cofactors contributing to pathogenesis and disease severity [8] . An assessment of the clinical severity of human infections with H7N9 virus has concluded that many mild cases may have occurred and the overall symptomatic case fatality risk is estimated to be <3% [7] .

Data on age-and sex-specific population prevalence were available for coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and obesity; agespecific but not sex-specific population prevalence was available for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [10] [11] [12] [13] . The definitions for these conditions are shown in the Supplementary Data. The age-and sex-stratified population prevalence of chronic heart disease (CHD; excluding isolated hypertension) was estimated from a study that recorded a prior history of hospitalization with coronary artery disease (A history of hospitalization for myocardial infarction or a surgical history of coronary balloon angioplasty, or coronary stent implantation or coronary artery bypass.) [10] . We assumed that the age distribution of coronary artery disease is a valid proxy for the age distribution of CHD. Where surveys assessed disease prevalence only in older adults, we assumed that prevalence was zero in those younger than the lower age limit of the survey. Because we were not able to source relevant baseline data for Vietnam, we have assumed that the age distribution of chronic diseases is similar in the Chinese and Vietnamese populations.",

            "text": "One of the most striking differences in this and other comparative analysis is the high median age of H7N9 patients [16] . This age distribution is unlikely to be due to differences in humoral immunity as the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to H7N9 virus is probably low in all ages [17] [18] [19] [20] . It might arise either because elderly people are more often exposed to the animal or environmental reservoir of H7N9 viruses, or because elderly people have a greater propensity to become infected or severely ill following exposure. After adjusting for the age-and sex-specific prevalence of chronic illnesses in the general Chinese population, we found that CHD was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection (RR, 9.68; 95% CI, 5.24-17.9). The age distribution of H7N9 patients may therefore be partially explained by an increased propensity in persons with CHD (who are mostly older) to develop severe disease following infection with H7N9 virus. The overrepresentation of males among H7N9 patients may also be partially explained by this association, because in China coronary heart disease is commoner in males than females (male prevalence, 0.74%; female prevalence, 0.51%) [10] . In agreement with our results, an age-and sex-matched case control study of 25 H7N9 cases has reported that the presence of a preexisting chronic medical condition (excluding hypertension) was associated with H7N9 disease (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.5-16.9) [21] . Although only 11% of H7N9 patients reported a history of CHD, unrecognized CHD may have been present in some individuals, and other unmeasured age-related factors, such as impaired innate and cell-mediated immunity, might also contribute to the observed age distribution of hospitalized H7N9 cases [17, 22, 23] . H7N9 viruses isolated from humans exhibit a mixed receptor specificity, binding both \u03b12-6and \u03b12-3linked sialidases [3, 4, 20] . H7N9 virus can infect cells of both the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans and ferrets, and disease in ferrets is more severe following intratracheal inoculation [5, 6, 20] . This raises the possibility that susceptibility of humans to severe H7N9 disease may be a consequence of an impaired ability to control virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. A history of chronic renal disease was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection, but the number of patients with this condition was small, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. A history of smoking was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization with H7N9, H5N1, and pH1N1 virus infections. This is an unexpected finding that might be biased by inconsistent definitions and methods of ascertaining smoking history, which were not standardized in the clinical datasets.",

The hematological and serum chemistry abnormalities suggest that subjects hospitalized with H7N9 have a severe systemic illness.

High levels of chemokines and cytokines have been identified in patients with H7N9 virus infection [20] . Extrapulmonary virus replication is an alternative explanation for the severity of hospitalized H7N9 cases, but H7N9 virus does not posses the polybasic amino acid motif at the HA cleavage site normally associated with extrapulmonary virus replication, and experimental H7N9 virus infection of ferrets has provided little evidence of systemic replication [2, 34, 35] . H7N9 viral RNA has been detected in the serum, urine, and feces of H7N9 patients but it is not known if this represents viral replication occurring outside of the respiratory tract [35] .",

However, we have tried to minimize these potential biases by restricting our analysis only to hospitalized subjects and to variables where data were available for a reasonable proportion of all cases. Although the H5N1 patients from China and Vietnam had very similar demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and behavioral risk factors, there were some differences in clinical presentation (Supplementary Data), and we cannot exclude that the clinical phenotype of H5N1 virus infections may be heterogeneous. We used univariate analysis that adjusted for age and sex to explore possible risk factors for hospitalization with H7N9; interactions effects were not assessed and the estimated odds ratios and RRs might be confounded by other Figure 2 .

The identification in H7N9 patients of known risk factors for severe seasonal influenza and the more protracted clinical course compared with H5N1 patients suggests that host factors may be an important contributor to the severity of H7N9 virus infection. This is consistent with the observation that there have probably been a large number of undetected mild H7N9 virus infections, and to date the patients with detected mild infection have been predominantly young (mean age, 13 years) [7, 14] . H7N9 virus has recently reemerged in China. People with chronic medical conditions that are traditionally associated with a higher risk of severe complications following seasonal influenza virus infection should be targeted for preventive interventions and for early treatment with antiviral drugs should they develop a respiratory illness.",
