            "text": "Apoptosis of host cells profoundly influences virus propagation and dissemination, events that are integral to influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenesis. The trigger for activation of apoptosis is regulated by an intricate interplay between cellular and viral proteins, with a strong bearing on IAV replication. Though the knowledge of viral proteins and mechanisms employed by IAV to induce apoptosis has advanced considerably of late, we know relatively little about the repertoire of host factors targeted by viral proteins. Thus, identification of cellular proteins that are hijacked by the virus will help us not only to understand the molecular underpinnings of IAV-induced apoptosis, but also to design future antiviral therapies. Here we show that the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV directly interacts with and suppresses the expression of API5, a host antiapoptotic protein that antagonizes E2F1-dependent apoptosis. siRNA-mediated depletion of API5, in NP-overexpressed as well as IAV-infected cells, leads to upregulation of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), a downstream modulator of E2F1-mediated apoptosis, and cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, although a reciprocal pattern of these events was observed on ectopic overexpression of API5. In concordance with these observations, annexin V and 7AAD staining assays exhibit downregulation of early and late apoptosis in IAV-infected or NP-transfected cells on overexpression of API5. Most significantly, while overexpression of API5 decreases viral titers, cellular NP protein as well as mRNA levels in IAV-infected A549 cells, silencing of API5 expression causes a steep rise in the same parameters. From the data reported in this manuscript, we propose a proapoptotic role for NP in IAV pathogenesis, whereby it suppresses expression of antiapoptotic factor API5, thus potentiating the E2F1-dependent apoptotic pathway and ensuring viral replication.",

            "text": "Apoptosis, the major form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in viral disease progression and pathogenesis of many viruses. 1 Host cells employ the apoptotic pathway effectively to stall virus replication. 2 Viruses on the other hand devise strategies to evade such host responses geared towards minimizing apoptosis in infected cells. 3 Nevertheless, some pathogenic viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) actively elicit apoptotic response upon infection, as a mechanism of cell death and virus propagation. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, apoptosis plays a pivotal role in the influenza life cycle. Although in early stages of viral infection, IAV activates antiapoptotic signals through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/RAC serine/threonine protein kinase, heat-shock proteins 10, 11 and JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling 12 pathways to evade the host defense mechanism, in the later stages IAV triggers apoptosis through activation of intrinsic pathways in order to achieve enhanced viral replication and dissemination. [13] [14] [15] IAV, an enveloped RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae, possesses a genome of eight negative sense RNAs encapsulated by nucleoprotein (NP), encoding around 16 proteins. 16 Given the limited coding capacity of IAV genome it is not surprising that IAV exploits host proteins extensively to its advantage. 17 The exploitation of cellular apoptotic pathways has been exhibited by many proteins encoded by IAV, such as PB1F2, NS1, M1, M2, and lately NP, all targeting strategic points in the host apoptotic pathway. 15, [18] [19] [20] [21] Of all the proteins encoded by IAV, NP is the most conserved and abundantly expressed. It is a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in apoptosis, transcription, replication, morphogenesis, and budding of the virus. Besides having crucial roles in the viral life cycle, NP also functions as a key adapter molecule mediating the cross talk between virus and host cell processes, owing to its ability to interact with a wide variety of both viral as well as cellular factors. 22 In the present study, we show that NP of IAV induces apoptosis in host cells by repressing apoptosis inhibitor protein 5 (API5). API5 also known as antiapoptosis clone 11 protein, is 55 kDa apoptosis-inhibiting nuclear protein, first identified as a factor that prevented apoptosis in growth factordeficient conditions. 23 Besides being ubiquitously expressed in many human tissues, it is found to be upregulated in various cancers such as cervical cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Recently elucidated crystal structure of API5 revealed many protein-protein interaction modules such as HEAT and ARM repeats, suggesting API5 may interact with other cellular proteins. 29 Mechanistically, API5 targets and interacts with acinus, a cellular protein involved in chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, to prevent acinus-mediated DNA fragmentation, and thus, apoptosis. 30 Incidentally, API5 was identified in a genetic screen as a factor responsible for suppression of E2F1-dependent apoptosis, which was further shown to involve apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1)-mediated cleavage of initiator as well as effector caspases. 31 In our study, we show that NP of different strains of IAV interacts specifically with API5 in IAV-infected mammalian cells. We examine the physiological effect of the NP-API5 interaction on cellular status of API5 and its role as a regulator of E2F1-dependent apoptosis. We show that NP quells the cellular levels of API5, thus promoting recruitment of E2F1 on APAF1 promoter. Lastly, our study sheds light on the significance of this interaction on IAV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. Taken together, our study defines a novel antagonistic relationship between viral NP and host antiapoptotic protein API5, which impinges on IAV-induced apoptosis and viral propagation.",

In the second approach, A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1, and cells were fixed at 5 and 16 h p.i. followed by immunofluorescence (Figures 2c-e) . As shown in the Figure 2b , NP of IAV colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. Similar observations were also made in cells infected with PR8 strain of IAV (Figures 2d and e) . It is interesting to note that API5 is a nuclear protein containing an NLS at its C terminus. 30 Further, strong evidence suggests that API5 is a negative regulator of apoptosis induced by E2F1 (a nuclear protein). 31 In light of these reports, nuclear colocalization of API5 with NP of IAV raises an interesting possibility that NP exploits E2F1-mediated apoptotic pathway via its interaction with API5.",

Influenza virus is known to induce apoptosis during later stages of infection in order to facilitate effective viral propaga-tion and dissemination. 34 Concurrent with these findings, we observed a time-dependent increase in APAF1 protein levels, cleaved forms of both caspases 9 and 3 in infected cells (Figure 4a ), indicative of progressive apoptosis. PARP cleavage was used as a marker of caspase activity. In addition, the relative levels of APAF1 mRNA were elevated significantly (~2-fold) in infected cells ( Figure 4b ). Interestingly, overexpression of NP in A549 cells mirrored the effect of IAV infection on cellular apoptosis. As observed during IAV infection, NP overexpression (pcDNA3.1-myc/His-NP) too was marked by elevated levels of cleaved caspases and PARP, underscoring role of NP in IAV-induced apoptosis ( Figure 4c ).

As depicted in Figure 5a , there is a significant decrease in the levels of procaspases 3 and 9, and concomitant increase in the levels of their cleaved products along with increased PARP cleavage in infected cells treated with API5-specific siRNA when compared with scrambled siRNA. Moreover, relative levels of APAF1 mRNA as well as protein increased markedly upon knockdown of API5 in infected cells (Figures 5a and b) .

It is well established that E2F1-dependent apoptosis involves transcriptional activation of target genes such as APAF1 by E2F1 transcription factor, which further entails physical binding of E2F1 to target gene promoters. 35 In order to delineate mechanistic details of antiapoptotic effects of API5 on E2F1-triggered apoptotic response in IAV-infected cells, we performed ChIP assay to investigate the status of E2F1 recruitment to APAF1 promoter under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells. As shown in Figure 6a , siRNA-mediated knockdown of API5 expression facilitated increased recruitment of E2F1 to APAF1 promoter. By contrast, enforced expression of API5 in infected cells led to abrogation of E2F1 occupancy on APAF1 promoter (Figure 6b ). On the basis of these observations, we conclude that API5, in order to obstruct the proapoptotic pathway, interferes with recruitment of E2F1 transcription factor to target gene promoters such as APAF1. Hence, it is of paramount importance for IAV to direct downregulation of this antiapoptotic factor, in order to ensure successful viral infection and spread.",

Our findings thus far have highlighted an inhibitory role of API5 in IAV-infected cells, which is exercised via regulation of the E2F1-APAF1 apoptotic pathway. Further, our results also indicate that suppression of API5 by NP is instrumental in ensuring IAV-induced apoptosis. In this regard it is worthy to note that IAV-mediated apoptosis of infected cells favors viral replication and propagation. 36, 37 Considering that API5 plays a critical role in IAV-induced apoptosis, it was imperative for us to evaluate the significance of API5 in IAV replication. For this purpose, we quantified the levels of NP mRNA in IAV-infected cells under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression. Upon knockdown of API5 expression in A549-infected cells there was a significant upregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP when compared with control ( Figure 8b) . Conversely, enforced expression of API5 led to the downregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP (Figure 8f ). In addition, NP protein levels were in agreement with mRNA levels under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells (Figures 8a and e) . Importantly, API5 depletion in infected cells led to~5-fold increase in the viral titers as determined by plaque assay when compared with control ( Figure 8c) . Conversely, API5 overexpression severely attenuated viral titers (~6-folds) (Figure 8g) . These results were further confirmed using a replicase assay, wherein A549 cells were antibody. The genomic DNA bound to E2F1 antibody was isolated and analyzed by quantitative PCR using APAF1 primers. The data are shown as mean \u00b1 S.D. of three independent experiments. # and * indicate statistically significant difference at Po0.05 and Po0.01, respectively treated with either non-targeting siRNA or API5-specific siRNA followed by co-transfection with plasmids encoding PR8 polymerase complex genes PB2, PB1, PA, and NP in conjunction with a reporter plasmid containing the UTR of the NS1 segment upstream of the luciferase gene driven by the human RNA pol I promoter. Strengthening our previous observations, replicase assay results showed sixfold elevation in replicase activity upon depletion of API5 (Figure 8d ). Upregulation of NP mRNA, protein levels, polymerase activity as well as viral titers in API5-depleted cells are clear indicators that viral replication is inhibited by the host factor API5. NP interacts and downregulates API5 to relieve suppression of the E2F1-APAF1 apoptotic pathway.",

            "text": "We have shown that API5 interacts with NP of IAV and not with other viral proteins such as M1 and NS1, suggesting specificity of interaction with NP (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Importantly, the interaction is conserved in H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, underlining its relevance in IAV pathogenicity (Figures 1a and b) . It is worth noting that API5 and NP interact primarily in the nucleus (Figures 2b and d) and incidentally the nuclear localization of API5 is known to be instrumental for its control of E2F1-dependent activation of proapoptotic gene APAF1. 30, 31 Thus, we expected nuclear localization of NP and API5 to have a bearing on APAF1 transcriptional status. Indeed, NP induced APAF1 transcription, which was further facilitated by API5 depletion, whereas it was remarkably dampened by API5 overexpression (Figures 5b and c) . Importantly, silencing of API5 expression led to E2F1 enrichment on APAF1 promoter in infected cells ( Figure 6 ). Hence, we propose that interaction of API5 with NP of IAV sequesters it, rendering it unable to oppose E2F1-dependent transactivation of proapoptotic genes. Not surprisingly, proteins encoded by other viruses such as EBNA3C protein encoded by Epstein barr virus and Hepatitis , and NP) derived from PR8 (H1N1 virus) were co-transfected alongside a reporter plasmid containing noncoding sequence from the NS1 segment of influenza A virus and luciferase gene driven by the pol I promoter in A549 cells that had been pretreated with either NT or API5 siRNA. Plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, WI, USA), which expresses renilla luciferase, was co-transfected as an internal control for data normalization. (e) A549 cells were transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) for 24 h followed by infection with either mock (allantoic fluid) or PR8 at an MOI 1. The cells were collected at 24 h post infection. The whole-cell lysate was resolved on SDS-PAGE and western blotted with anti-NP and anti-GAPDH antibodies, respectively. (f) Total RNA was isolated for the estimation of NP mRNA levels using quantitative PCR with specific primers. (g) A549 cells were transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) for 24 h followed by infection with X31 virus at an MOI 1. The cells were collected at 24 h post infection. Aliquot of supernatant obtained from IAV-infected cells was used to infect MDCK cells followed by the determination of viral titers using a plaque assay. The data in b, c, d, f and g are shown as mean \u00b1 S.D. of three independent experiments. # and * indicate statistically significant difference at Po0.05 and Po0.01, respectively B virus X antigen (HBx) encoded by hepatitis B virus have been previously reported to regulate E2F1-mediated apoptosis in favor of virus. 44, 45 Previous reports have shown that IAV sequesters host antiapoptotic protein bcl2 through its phosphorylation by activating cellular p38MAPK, facilitating viralinduced apoptosis. 46 IAV has previously been shown to induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, 21 which involves initiator caspase activation mediated by apoptosome, a complex consisting of cytochrome c, APAF1, and dATP, which in turn binds and activates caspases. 47 NP of IAV has been recently shown to promote the release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm through its modulation of clusterin-Bax association. 21 Previously, it has been reported that M1 protein favors APAF1 expression through its interaction with and sequestration of Hsp70, a known inhibitor of APAF1. 19 In the present study, we elucidate an emerging role of NP in regulation of APAF1 levels ( Figure 4) . Importantly, our data suggest that API5 overexpression antagonizes this function of IAV by abrogating E2F1 recruitment to the APAF1 promoter (ChIP assays, Figure 6 ), thus preventing its transactivation. There is documented evidence which indicates that caspase 3 activation during the onset of apoptosis is a crucial event for efficient influenza virus propagation. 36 In agreement with this report, we show that IAV infection and NP expression induce activation of caspases 9 and 3 ( Figure 4 ). API5 knockdown facilitated activation of caspases in IAV microenvironment, highlighting the negative role of API5 in IAV-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 ). Essentially, API5 downregulates APAF1 and prevents activation of caspases, thus impeding apoptosome formation under infection conditions. Further, IAV employs NP to interact with and sequester API5 along with transcriptionally suppressing it, thus ensuring uninterrupted activation of the apoptotic pathway. Hence, taking all our current observations in view, it appears that different proteins encoded by IAV, such as NP and M1, utilize multiple mechanisms to target strategic host proteins involved in regulation of the cellular apoptotic network for instance Hsp70, clusterin, Bax, and now API5.",

In agreement with previously reported role of NP in IAVinduced apoptosis, 7AAD, and annexin V staining results indicated higher number of apoptotic cells upon NP overexpression ( Figure 7) . Interestingly, ectopic expression of API5 either alone or with NP led to a significant reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, reinforcing the notion that API5 opposes the apoptosis-inducing function of NP. Apoptosis is critical for viral replication and dissemination, 48 which is also the case with influenza virus replication as overexpression of antiapoptotic factor API5 led to a decrease in viral transcription, which was concurrent with decrease in viral protein levels ( Figure 8) . Consistently, API5 depletion increased viral polymerase activity and viral titers, further confirming that expression of antiapoptotic protein API5 is detrimental for viral replication and propagation ( Figure 8) .",

Although DNA viruses promote cell cycle progression and prevent apoptosis, RNA viruses for example HIV, coronavirus IBV, and influenza virus arrest cell cycle at an early stage of infection. [50] [51] [52] These reports, together with role of API5 in cell proliferation, raise a compelling possibility that regulation of API5 by NP in IAV-infected cells, apart from its role in apoptosis, may also impact E2F1-mediated cell cycle control. Although it is not the focal point of the present study, it shall be interesting to evaluate the role of API5 in IAV-mediated cell cycle arrest and its repercussions on viral replication.",

Further, our study warrants quest for more host proteins critical for viral life cycle, the elucidation of which can provide useful insights into designing novel antiviral interventional strategies.
