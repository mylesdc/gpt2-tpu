            "text": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 form a non-covalently linked heterodimer on the viral surface that mediates viral entry. E1, E2 and the heterodimer complex E1E2 are candidate vaccine antigens, but are technically challenging to study because of difficulties in producing natively folded proteins by standard protein expression and purification methods. To better comprehend the antigenicity of these proteins, a library of alanine scanning mutants comprising the entirety of E1E2 (555 residues) was created for evaluating the role of each residue in the glycoproteins. The mutant library was probed, by a highthroughput flow cytometry-based assay, for binding with the co-receptor CD81, and a panel of 13 human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target continuous and discontinuous epitopes of E1, E2, and the E1E2 complex. Together with the recently determined crystal structure of E2 core domain (E2c), we found that several residues in the E2 back layer region indirectly impact binding of CD81 and mAbs that target the conserved neutralizing face of E2. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the E2 back layer in interacting with the E2 front layer for its biological function. We also identified regions of E1 and E2 that likely located at or near the interface of the E1E2 complex, and determined that the E2 back layer also plays an important role in E1E2 complex formation. The conformationdependent reactivity of CD81 and the antibody panel to the E1E2 mutant library provides a global view of the influence of each amino acid (aa) on E1E2 expression and folding. This information is valuable for guiding protein engineering efforts to enhance the antigenic properties and stability of E1E2 for vaccine antigen development and structural studies.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health concern with over 170 million people currently infected and an additional 3 million being infected each year (reviewed in [1, 2] ). While approximately 30% of infected individuals are capable of spontaneously clearing the virus, usually within the first 12 months of infection, the remainder generally develops life-long infection. Of those who progress to chronic infection, about 20% develop liver cirrhosis and 1-3% hepatocellular carcinoma, one of the leading causes of cancer mortality [2, 3] . As a member of the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, HCV contains a positive-sense, singlestranded RNA genome coding for three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins [4] (Fig 1A) . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, which lacks proofreading activity, gives rise to the heterogeneous viral quasispecies and the diverse viral genotypes in circulation. The high rate of infection in endemic countries and the morbidity caused by subsequent liver damage [5] , as well as underdiagnosis, costly treatments and high rate of reinfection [6, 7] , highlight the need for an effective HCV vaccine to limit virus infection and spread.",

E1 encompasses residues 192-383 of the HCV polyprotein (prototypic strain H77), while E2 is the larger of the two envelope proteins and spans amino acids 384-746 ( Fig 1B) . In association with apolipoproteins, HCV forms lipoviroparticles that attach and infect hepatocytes using a number of host entry factors including CD81, scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1), claudin-1, occludin, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and others whose roles are still under investigation (reviewed in [4, 8] ). CD81 was the first entry receptor identified and is the best-characterized entry factor to date. Many studies have demonstrated that CD81 is capable of binding to soluble E2, and antibodies targeting the large extracellular loop of CD81 (CD81-LEL) prevent HCV infection both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in [9] ). While E2 is known to interact with CD81 and SR-B1 (reviewed in [10] ), it appears that E1 may help modulate these interactions and could play a role in membrane fusion [11] [12] [13] .",

Canonical class II fusion proteins consist of three protein domains with an elongated structure in which domain 2 harbors the fusion peptide that is embedded within the dimer interfaces (reviewed in [17] ). In contrast, E2 is globular in shape with the E2c adopting a compact architecture surrounded by disordered variable loops. E2c consists of a central Ig-like \u03b2-sandwich scaffold flanked by front and back layers of protein consisting of loops, short helices, and \u03b2-sheets [15, 16] . Cross-neutralizing antibodies that recognize E2c primarily map to the front layer, which is also a component of the CD81 binding site (CD81bs) [15] . Recent findings suggest that the CD81bs is exceptionally flexible in the soluble protein form and could present many non-optimal conformations during immunization [18] . Structural information for E1 is more limited, consisting of NMR studies of putative membrane proximal regions and a recent crystal structure of the N-terminal region, which displays an unusual disulfide-linked multimeric (nE1) organization [19] .",

To date, a number of antibodies targeting E1, E2, or the E1E2 complex have been isolated, some exhibiting cross-neutralizing behavior when tested against multiple viral genotypes (reviewed in [20] [21] [22] ). The recent X-ray structures of E2c, E1 and E2 peptides complexed with several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have provided partial yet critical information on the architecture and functions of the glycoproteins [15, 16, [23] [24] [25] . To gain a greater understanding of the HCV envelope glycoprotein antigens, we exploited an alanine scanning mutant library spanning the entirety of E1 and E2, which had been recently created using a high-throughput shotgun mutagenesis method [26] . The comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis, in combination with antibodies recognizing a wide range of discontinuous epitopes, can provide a snapshot of how the different regions in E1 and E2 may be brought together to form the epitopes. We tested binding by a panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and CD81-LEL fused to the immunoglobulin Fc fragment to probe the diverse epitopes encompassing distinct continuous and discontinuous antigenic The approximately 3000 amino-acid HCV polyprotein generates 10 proteins following cleavage, of which E1 and E2 are two of the three structural proteins. (B) Spanning amino acids 192-383, the structure of E1 is poorly understood although crystallization of the first half of the protein (aa192-271) revealed secondary structures that could be present in native E1 [19] including an \u03b1-helix flanked by several \u03b2-sheets. In contrast, E2 (aa 384-746) has several well-defined regions containing \u03b2-sheets, \u03b1-helices, and \u03b7 (3 10 ) helices. Sequences for regions in which secondary structure is known (e.g. nE1, E2 front layer, \u03b2-sandwich core, back layer, etc.) are included (prototypic H77 sequence). Green-branched forks depict relative locations of N-linked glycans. (C) Crystal structure of E2c [15] illustrated that E2 is characterized by a globular structure with a central Iglike core flanked by front and back layers. The front layer, \u03b2-sandwich core, CD81 binding loop, and back layer are colored as depicted in panel (B).",

Only mutant T329A resulted in markedly reduced V5 expression compared to the other mutants in the library (Fig 2A) ; however, since a number of mAbs showed high levels of binding to the T329A mutant clone (S1 Table) , it is possible that the V5 tag is partially occluded in this clone.

The mapping approach used in this study correctly identified the critical residues L413, N415, G418, and W420 for both HCV1 and AP33, in overall agreement with previous mapping studies (Fig 3A and 3B [24, 25, 30, 31, 36] ).

As expected, in our screening, mAbs AR1A and AR1B required many of the same residues for binding, confirming that these two antibodies recognize distinct but overlapping epitopes. Eight residues were found to be important for binding of mAb AR1A to E2 (Fig 4A) while five of these residues were also required for AR1B binding (Fig 4B) . When visualized on the E2c structure (Fig 4C) , residues recognized by both AR1A and AR1B are localized to a pocket near the top of E2c that is formed from the outer layer of the \u03b2 sandwich in the previously described non-neutralizing face of E2c [15] . The remaining residues that are important for AR1A binding-G495, T519, and Y632-are located on the periphery of the pocket and may play an indirect role in binding. While both mAbs target the same antigenic region, only AR1A is capable of blocking CD81 binding to E2 [33] . Indeed, our results confirm that mutations of the epitope residues shared between mAbs AR1A and AR1B did not alter binding of CD81-LEL, while mutations of the three residues specific for AR1A resulted in decreased CD81 binding (S1 Table) . The complete library scanning analysis also helped reassign the roles of several critical residues identified in previous mapping experiments (S2A Table) . For example, two residues, V538 and N540, were originally thought to play Flow cytometry confirms that residues 413-420 within the HCV1 and AP33 epitope are critical for binding to E2. The reactivity (as % of wildtype) of HCV1 (A) and AP33 (B) to E1E2 mutants suggested to encompass the HCV1 and AP33 epitope is shown. Previously published results are included, all of which utilized ELISA to measure reactivity. Coloring corresponds to the reactivity to each E1E2 mutant with <25% red, 25-50% orange, 51-75% green, and >75% white. For HCV1, our flow cytometry findings for L413 and W420 agree with previous reports.

With the exception of P525, the critical residues that were identified in the original mAb characterization were also observed by flow cytometry (S2C Table) . Hydrogen-bond calculations on the E2c-AR3C structure indicated that front layer residues C429, S432, and Y443 have hydrogenbonding partners on the heavy chain of the AR3C Fab ( Fig 6C) . When these three residues were mutated, AR3C reactivity dropped to 1%, 55%, and 15% for these three residues, respectively, confirming their importance in the AR3C epitope. Bailey and colleagues reported that polymorphisms at four E2 amino acids (L433I, L438I, F442I, and K446E) resulted in resistance to mAb AR3C [34] . Yet in our study, we observed decreased AR3C reactivity for L438A and F442A, and enhanced AR3C binding for L433A and K446A mutants compared to wild-type (S1 Table) . While side chain loss by mutation to alanine can eliminate interactions energetically important for antibody binding, in this case the differences in side chains likely also modify the conformation of E2 front layer main chain for antibody recognition.",

These data confirmed results from prior mapping experiments, which proposed that several residues between 420 and 535 are important for CD81 binding [27, 37, 38] . However, prior to the crystallization of E2c, alanine scanning mutagenesis indicated that several E2 back layer residues between 613-620 might also be involved in CD81 binding [38, 39] . To evaluate these results, we screened a recombinant CD81-LEL Fc-fusion protein against the E1E2 mutant library. As expected, screening of CD81-LEL against the E1E2 mutant library confirmed that many residues within the front layer and the CD81 binding loop are required for CD81 recognition (S1 Table, Fig 7A) . We also noted several residues in the central Ig \u03b2 sandwich scaffold that may play an indirect role possibly through stabilization of the front layer and CD81 binding loop structures. As noted above, many back layer mutants perturbed E1E2 global folding, thus preventing us from determining whether these residues bind CD81 directly. However, we found that six back layer mutants reduced CD81 reactivity to 25% of wild-type reactivity without disrupting global folding: P601A, T604A, Y613A, W616A, C620A, and V633A (S1 Table) . The back layer appears to affect front layer architecture indirectly with specific interactions between back layer \u03b12 helix residues Y613 and W616 and front layer \u03b11 helix residues W437 and L441 ( Fig  7B) . Y613 and W616 are within close proximity to the front layer \u03b1 helix and our analysis confirms that mutation of either residue abolished CD81-LEL binding.",

The mutant viruses were found to be mostly poorly or non-infectious (0-27% wild-type infectivity) (S5 Table) In addition, HCVpp produced in this study were found to contain covalently linked, oligomeric forms of E2 and noncovalent E1 (S4C Fig). In a previous study of HCVpp by immunoprecipitation of transfected cell supernatant using anti-E2 mAbs, noncovalent E1E2 heterodimers, presumably E1E2 secreted from the transfected cells, were also detected [40] . In cell culture HCV (HCVcc), the majority of E1 and E2 appeared to form covalent oligomers [41] . [15] , residues in four distinct E2c regions were found to be important for CD81 binding: the front layer (cyan), Ig \u03b2-sandwich (red), CD81 loop (blue), and the back layer (green). The locations of mutations resulting in <25% CD81 binding in each of these regions are highlighted. (B) Hydrogen bond calculations indicate that two back layer residues in the \u03b12-helix, Y613 and W616 (green), interact with L441 and W437 (cyan) of the front layer \u03b11-helix, respectively. m.c-main chain; s.c-side chain. These interactions between front and back layer residues suggest that the back layer indirectly affects CD81 binding through structural interactions with the adjacent front layer. The residue colors follows those in Fig 1C. (C) Based on flow cytometry and ELISA, I622A, which was found to enhance CD81 binding, was analyzed further (along with F627A). Soluble E2c mutants harboring I622A, I622A/F627A and F627A were tested using ELISA for their ability to bind recombinant WT CD81-Fc (left panel) or a mutant that reduces CD81 dimerization, CD81-Fc (K124T) (middle panel). Binding signals to mAb HCV1 were used as an expression control for the mutants (right panel).",

We used the two mAb types to identify potential E1E2 interface residues based on the effect of alanine substitution on their binding: (1) low binding by anti-E2 and anti-E1E2, (2) low binding by anti-E1E2 only, or (3) low binding by anti-E2 only.

However, since the two anti-E1E2 antibodies, AR4A and AR5A, recognize non-overlapping epitopes, mutation of residues that severely impact binding by one mAb should not affect binding by the other. Surprisingly, the majority (31) of Class 2 residue mutations affected binding of both mAbs in a similar manner regardless of their location on E1 or E2. This implies that these Class 2 residues, outside the AR4A and AR5A binding epitopes, are important for formation of the E1E2 complex, either by influencing folding of E1, or by being part of the complex interface. Class 2 residues are 97% conserved, which highlights their importance to overall structural integrity, with nine of them being cysteines. Among Class 2 residues, 20 of 34 are located on E2 within the flanking regions of VR2 (2 cysteines), \u03b2-sandwich scaffold, VR3, post-VR3, back layer and stalk regions (Fig 8A) . When visualized on the crystal structure of E2c, the Class 2 residues strikingly cluster on one surface of E2c that is opposite to the CD81 receptor-binding site (Fig 8B) . Similar to the CD81 binding site, this region is nearly glycan free, but contains flexible and disordered loops, which might require interaction with E1 to fold properly. We also tested binding of anti-E1E2 antibodies to a number of deletion mutants lacking regions harboring the Class 2 residues (S3 Fig). Mutants lacking VR2, VR3, post-VR3 and stalk did not bind to AR4A and AR5A mAbs, in agreement with the results of the alanine scanning mutagenesis. Of note, E1E2 mutants lacking the stalk region did not bind to AR2A and AR3A mAbs suggesting that absence of stalk region can have a deleterious effect on overall E2 folding. Class 2 residues on E1 includes 6 of the 8 E1 cysteine residues that mainly map to the nE1 region that has been crystallized and whose structure has been determined ( Fig 8A, [19] ).",

Unfortunately, high genetic variability of the virus has proven to be a major roadblock for designing a vaccine.

The library was created by substituting alanine for every residue (and serine for alanine residues) of the H77 genotype 1a E1 and E2 proteins followed by high-throughput flow cytometry analysis to measure antibody reactivity to each mutant [26] . A number of mutations affected E1E2 global folding as determined by substantial reduction in reactivity to multiple conformation-dependent antibodies. Most of these residues are located in the central Ig scaffold and the back layer of E2, indicating the importance of these regions for folding of E1E2. In particular, the large number of back layer residues (42%) that impact E1E2 global folding, and the indirect effects of this region on the neighboring central Ig scaffold and distal front layer, indicate the importance of the back layer on E2 structure and function.",

However, when tested by ELISA, only Y611A and R614A meet the criteria established for determining residues that impact overall protein folding (S4 Table) . Such differences based on assay method were also observed for AR2A reactivity to back layer mutants (Fig 5A and 5B ). AR2A is known to bind only to genotype 1a viruses unless the HVR1 region is deleted [33, 43] , which raises the possibility that masking of epitopes under different conditions could affect reactivity. In ELISA, E1E2 antigens are often prepared in the form of cell lysates and the solubilized protein complex is captured by G. nivalis lectin (GNL) onto a solid support for detecting binding antibodies. In flow cytometry, E1E2 is presented as an intracellular membrane-associated antigen (S1 Table, S1 Fig) . Thus, subtle differences in epitope presentation may account for variations in reactivity, predominantly in the back layer but also at other antigenic sites.",

            "text": "Several studies have suggested that the viral fusion peptide is located within the E1 glycoprotein [46] [47] [48] [49] . Peptide library experiments on membrane rupture, hemifusion, and fusion suggest that the putative fusion peptide is located between residue 265-296 [48] . However, there is evidence for and against this hypothesis. The hydrophobic region spanning residues 265-296 is relatively conserved among genotypes, especially the two cysteine and two glycine residues within this region, and displays similarities to other flavivirus fusion peptides [46] . Since viral fusion peptides and fusion loops are intrinsically metastable, they are usually hidden and protected until fusion is activated [50, 51] . If this region is indeed the fusion peptide, mutations in this region should affect E1E2 assembly while maintaining CD81 receptor binding. Previous mutagenesis studies indicate that mutations within this E1 region did not affect E1E2 association or binding to CD81 receptor [46, 52] . In contrast, flow cytometry analysis of this region here showed reduced CD81 receptor binding to several mutants including Y276A (50%), G278A (50%), and D279A (48%), while E1E2 complex formation was mostly unaffected. Since receptor binding occurs in a step preceding fusion, these residues are likely affecting entry and not fusion. These conflicting results demand stronger evidence to sustain the hypothesis that the E1 region 265-296 is the fusion peptide.",

Other groups have found that W420, Y527, W529, G530, and D535 were critical for CD81 binding, while H421, I422, S424, G523, T526, and F550 reduced CD81 binding by at least 50% when mutated [27, 55] . Analysis of the E1E2 library confirms that alanine mutations at the afore-mentioned 11 residues exhibit less than 25% CD81-LEL reactivity (S1 Table) . In a structural context, the E2c structure and the negative-stain EM reconstruction of the E2 ectodomain bound to CD81-LEL validate the roles of the residues located at the front layer (aa 420-450) and CD81 binding loop (aa 519-535) with some residues in the \u03b2-sandwich scaffold modulating this interaction [15] . The back layer Y613 and W616 were identified as also being crucial for CD81-LEL reactivity as they exhibited less than 3% binding activity when mutated to alanine. In the E2c structure, the side chains of both residues point towards the front layer \u03b11 helix and potentially hydrogen bond with the main chain of L441 and W437, respectively. These two residues may act as an anchor, stabilizing front layer folding and architecture of the CD81 binding site. Surprisingly, our study also found that mutation of back layer I622 enhanced CD81 binding. Recent mutagenesis studies have also corroborated the affinity enhancing effect of I622A [56] .",

Thus, the results presented here support the notion that the back layer can influence binding of CD81 and antibodies that target the front layer through indirect interactions. Additional interactions between back layer and \u03b2-sandwich residues were also observed, suggesting the back layer is highly involved in stabilizing the globular structure of E2.",

Further study of four representative back layer mutants (W616A, I622A, V629A and R639A) shows that the residues can affect different aspects of E1E2 critical to the infection cycle. Reduced glycoprotein incorporation was observed in 3 of the 4 back layer mutants examined (I622A, V629A and R639A), which may partly explain the reduced viral infectivity. In contrast, W616A mutation did not affect E1E2 incorporation yet the virus was non-infectious (S4B Fig and S5 Table) . These differences suggest that changes in the back layer can affect E1E2 functions in different ways (e.g. protein folding and incorporation onto virions, receptor binding, and other steps for productive infection). Although further studies are required to understand how the back layer is involved in these steps, our results underscore that this E2 region is an indispensable part of the E1E2 complex architecture.",

It is formed by two E2 regions, the front layer (a.a. 421-452) and the CD81 binding loop (a.a. 519-535). Although the majority of the residues in the front layer and CD81 binding loop are highly conserved (>90% conservation), natural variations are observed at a number of hot spots (<75% conservation) that include S424 (16%), E431 (11%), N434 (41%), W437 (46%), L438 (43%), G440 (56%), Q444 (0.2%), H445 (54%), K446 (65%), R521 (65%), S522 (33%), A524 (47%), S528 (25%), A531 (12%) and D533 (33%) (S1 Table) . Among the conserved residues, alanine substitution at T425, L427, N428, C429, G436 and L441 in the front layer region, T519, D520, G523, W529, G530 and D535 in the CD81 binding loop, greatly reduced the binding of the four AR3-specific mAbs. Obviously, viruses with natural variations at these conserved positions, provided not defective in replication, can potentially escape the AR3 mAbs. Nevertheless, the natural variations L442 in the genotype 5 isolates SA13 and UKN5.15.7, N519 in the genotype 2 isolate UKN2a1.2, and E535 in genotype 3 isolates S52 and UKN3a1.28, have not rendered the viruses more sensitive or resistant to mAb AR3A [35, 60, 61] . On the other hand, natural variations at the conserved L433 (94%), and the less conserved L438 (43%), F442 (81%) and K446 (65%), and E431 and a set of 3 residues outside AR3 (V538, L546 and V563) in some genotype 1 isolates, have been reported to confer resistance to some AR3 mAbs [34] . Interestingly, alanine substitution at L433, L438, F442 and K446 had variable effects on the binding of AR3 mAbs (S1 Table) . Given the differences in size, polarity, and charge, it is notable that alanine mutations at L433 and K466 have the opposite effect on AR3C binding compared to naturally occurring mutations to isoleucine, histidine, glutamic acid, or asparagine, which have been observed in E1E2 sequences [34] .",

Yet, in the context of virionincorporated glycoproteins, VR2 and VR3 (also known as IgVR, intergenotypic variable region) appear to affect E2 folding, assembly of E1E2 complex, receptor binding, HCVpp entry, and HCVcc infectivity, highlighting differences in requirements for the variable regions between recombinant E2 and virion-associated E1E2 [63] . We found that mutations within the variable regions of E2 were generally well tolerated since binding of CD81-LEL, and mAbs with continuous and discontinuous epitopes, was maintained for most mutants. However, mutations in 9 residues, F465A, Q467A, I472A in VR2, G573A, C581A, D584A, C585A in VR3, F586A and Y594A in post-VR3, reduced binding of E1E2-specific mAbs AR4A and AR5A by at least 50% compared to wild-type E1E2 without affecting binding of other mAbs.

Seven of the 20 important E2 residues that affect AR4A and AR5A binding are cysteines (C459, C486, C569, C585, C597, C652 and C677). Mutation of these cysteines did not affect the binding of other conformation-dependent mAbs, suggesting that they may not affect the overall fold of E2, but may instead play a role in maintaining the E1E2 complex. Alternatively, these cysteine residues could instead be unpaired and required for HCV infectivity. Fraser et al. proposed that both HCVpp and HCVcc systems require free thiol groups for entry and that E1E2 undergoes a shift from a reduced to an oxidized state during receptor attachment [64] . Moreover, McCaffrey and colleagues demonstrated that E2 can tolerate the presence of several free cysteines [65] . Thus, free cysteines may indirectly affect the binding of AR4A and AR5A while not impacting overall protein conformation. Altogether, our data suggest that a glycan-free face of E2, distal from the front layer, interacts with E1 forming the complex interface. It also appears that residues within the post-VR3 region, back layer and the E2 stalk may play a role in complex formation, either directly or indirectly (Fig 8C) . The importance of variable regions and E2 stalk in E1E2 assembly was also confirmed independently using mutants that lacked these regions (S3 Fig). Of note, it is yet to be proven that the Class 2 residues are physically in contact to form the E1E2 interface. Our attempts to study this by immunoprecipitation have not yielded conclusive results of a complete disruption of E1E2 complex formation. The transmembrane regions of E1 and E2 are crucial for E1E2 dimerization and specific mutations within either domain can reduce up to 75% of heterodimer formation [12] . It is possible that the interactions between E1 and E2 ectodomains are relatively feeble to allow for conformational rearrangement during viral entry and may not be easily detected in the presence of the transmembrane regions.",

This approach offers a global perspective of folding and expression of the complex, and provides insight into E1E2 structure and antigenicity. The results reported here are in agreement with the previously mapped targets for HCV1, AP33, and mAbs specific for AR1, AR2, and AR3. Residues in the E2 back layer appear to play a central role in maintaining not only E2 structure through interactions with the Ig scaffold and front layer, but also in overall folding of the E1E2 complex. Importantly, residues located on the back layer of E2 were also found to modulate AR3 and CD81-LEL binding, likely by stabilizing the structure of the front layer and CD81 binding loop. The E2 back layer region also appears to be central to E2 folding and function because individual alanine substitutions in this region universally reduced viral infectivity. It is evident that protein-engineering efforts should consider the contribution of several residues in the back layer region and the potential for global misfolding as a consequence of their mutation. This study also provides preliminary evidence of the location of the E1E2 interface at a glycan-deficient region opposite of the CD81 binding site. Several flexible or disordered loops present in this region have the potential to interact with E1 to form the functional E1E2 complex. Further studies to better define the E1E2 interface, particularly in the isolation and mapping of mAbs to E1 discontinuous epitopes and to study the mutations in the context of authentic virus, will greatly facilitate our understanding of the E1E2 complex. Intergenotypic incompatibilities between E1 and E2 suggesting coevolution of glycoproteins within a genotype should also be considered while studying complex formation [66] .",

On the other hand, mAbs targeting AR2 and AR3 are capable of neutralizing several viral genotypes. AR3 mAbs recognize the neutralizing face of E2c, which overlaps with the CD81 binding site while mAb AR2A binds to the back layer of the E2 protein [15, 33] .

Optimal mAb concentrations and binding conditions were determined using an independent immunofluoresence curve against wild-type E1E2 for each mAb. A concentration within the linear range and with suitable signal to background ratio (>5) was chosen for the library screening. The cells were incubated with anti-HCV antibody for 1 hour at 20\u02daC, or overnight at 4\u02daC, followed by washing three times with supplemented PBS and 0.1% saponin and a subsequent 30-minute incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 10% NGS, 0.1% saponin, and supplemented PBS.

Background fluorescence was determined by fluorescence measurement of vector-transfected control cells. mAb reactivity against each mutant HCV E1E2 clone was calculated relative to wild-type E1E2 by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type HCV E1E2-transfected controls.",

The counter-screen strategy and V5 expression tests facilitates the exclusion of E1E2 mutants that are locally misfolded or that have an expression defect [68, 69] . To be highlighted as an important residue, binding thresholds were established in which there was <25% binding of the mAb of interest but >75% binding of appropriate continuous and discontinuous control mAbs.

Specific E1E2 residues selected based on conservation across genotypes or by region (eg. back layer) were individually mutated to alanine using the QuikChange Lightening Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and specific PCR primers (Integrated DNA Technologies).

Further inclusion criteria included: human host only, genders, all geographical regions, and no defined collection period or sample source (e.g. serum, plasma, etc.). The criteria narrowed the results to 902 E1 and E2 sequences that were analyzed for sequence variation (SNP) at the amino-acid level. Percent conservation was calculated by dividing the total number of sequences analyzed by the number of sequences exhibiting the H77 reference strain (NC_004102) amino acid and subsequently converting to a percentage. Hydrogen bond calculations were performed using LigPlot [78] . Complete calculation results for the E2c-AR3C PDB file 4MWF are available upon request.",

Shotgun mutagenesis followed by whole cell analysis using flow cytometry offers an alternative to ELISA. (A) Highthroughput shotgun mutagenesis was used to create a plasmid mutant library for the entirety of E1E2, with each clone having a defined alanine mutation. Prior to screening the mutant library, each primary mAb was tested against wild-type E1E2 to determine optimal mAb concentration and conditions to achieve high signal to background ratio. HEK-293T cells were transfected with individual mutants from the library and subsequently fixed and permeabilized. Each mAb was tested against each mutant in the library by flow cytometry using a fluorescent secondary mAb to detect immunoreactivity. Background signal from mocktransfected cells was subtracted and the signals were normalized to the wild-type E1E2 positive control [26] . (B) Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on individual conserved residues of E1E2. Mutant E1E2-containing plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T cells and the cell lysate was added to lectin-coated ELISA plates at either high (1:5) or low (1:50) concentration. The panel of mAbs was tested against the mutant cell lysate using an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and TMB substrate to detect reactivity. Background signal from mock-transfected cell lysate was subtracted and the signal was normalized to the wild-type E1E2 positive control. (TIF) S2 Fig. Critical residues for AR3 antibodies. Data shown are the mutations resulting in 25% mean reactivity, expressed as percent of wild-type AR3B-D mAbs, but >75% of at least one control mAb, using the E1E2 mutant library and flow cytometry analysis (see Fig 6A for AR3A data). Mutants resulting in poor E1E2 expression (<40%) as determined by the C-terminal V5 tag and those implicated in global misfolding were removed. Binding assays were performed twice with the range indicated. (TIF) S3 Fig. Variable regions and stalk of E2 are critical for assembly of E1E2 complex. The importance of variable regions (HVR1, R2, VR3, post-VR3) and stalk of E2 for E1E2 complex formation was tested by ELISA. E1E2 from HEK-293T cell lysates (undiluted) co-transfected with deletion mutants lacking these regions and pAdv plasmid was captured using GNL, AR4A or AR5A (as indicated) and evaluated for binding using a panel of antibodies. Fulllength E1E2 without deletions (E1E2) and pAdv plasmid (Control) were used as positive and negative control, respectively. (TIF) S4 Fig. Functional analysis of E2 back layer. HCVpp was generated by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids expressing wild-type or back layer E1E2 mutant (W616A, I622A, V629A and R639A). A) Transfected cell lysates were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using biotinylated mAb A4 for E1 (red) and mAb HCV1 for E2 (green). E1 and E2 in mutants were quantified as a percentage of wild-type levels (middle and right panels). B) Purified virions were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mAb HCV1 for E2 (green) and anti-p24 for HIV-1-p24 (red). Percentage of E2 (relative to wild-type) was normalized to corresponding p24 levels (right panel). C) Purified virions were analyzed by nonreducing (left panel) and reducing (right panel) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using biotinylated mAb A4 for E1 (red) and mAb HCV1 for E2 (green). M, Molecular Marker; WT, wild-type. Experiments were performed in duplicate. (TIF) S1 Table. Percent reactivity of the mAb panel and CD81-LEL to E1E2 mutants. Mean reactivity determined by flow cytometry (FC) and ELISA, if available, is expressed as % wild-type binding level. Results from previous mapping experiments by others and those from our study are included for comparison. The percent conservation of each residue is included. Flow cytometry and ELISA analyses were performed as described in materials and methods. (XLSX) S2 Table. Comparison of flow cytometry data with previous mapping experiments. Our present flow cytometry (FC) and ELISA data with previously published ELISA data [35] were compared for mAbs AR1A & AR1B (A), AR2A (B), and AR3A-D (C). Coloring is based on percent reactivity relative to wild-type: <25%, red; 25-50%, orange; 51-75%, green; >75%, white; and-, not tested. \u00c3 likely perturbs global folding based on control mAb reactivity by flow cytometry. (XLSX) S3 Table. Back layer hydrogen bonding partners. Hydrogen bond interactions between several residues in the back layer region (BLR) and the front layer (FLR), the central Ig scaffold or the variable region 3 (VR3). Data were calculated from the E2 structure, PDB ID 4MWF [15] . m.c-main chain; s.c-side chain. (XLSX) S4 Table. E2 back layer mutations modulate CD81 binding to the E2 front layer and CD81 binding loop. The percent reactivity (given as percent of wild-type E1E2) of a panel of mAbs along with CD81-LEL, was determined for several back layer alanine mutants using either ELISA or flow cytometry (FC). Coloring corresponds to the level of binding: 25%, red; 26-50%, orange; 51-75%, green; 76-150%, white; and >150%, blue. Reactivity shown is a mean of 2-3 experiments. \u00c3 Based on FC, these mutants may inhibit proper global folding of E1E2. Table. Effect of back layer mutation on HCVpp infectivity. A panel of HCVpp with point mutation in the E2 back layer (residues 600-645) were generated. Infectivity of each mutant was measured in triplicate using Huh-7 cells and the results are shown as a percentage of infectivity relative to wild-type HCVpp. (XLSX)",
