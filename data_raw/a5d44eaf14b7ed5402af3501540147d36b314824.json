            "text": "The use of hospital isolation rooms has increased considerably in recent years due to the worldwide outbreaks of various emerging infectious diseases. However, the passage of staff through isolation room doors is suspected to be a cause of containment failure, especially in case of hinged doors. It is therefore important to minimize inadvertent contaminant airflow leakage across the doorway during such movements. To this end, it is essential to investigate the behavior of such airflows, especially the overall volume of air that can potentially leak across the doorway during door-opening and human passage. Experimental measurements using full-scale mock-ups are expensive and labour intensive. A useful alternative approach is the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling using a time-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. In this study simulated air flow patterns are qualitatively compared with experimental ones, and the simulated total volume of air that escapes is compared with the experimentally measured volume. It is shown that the LES method is able to reproduce, at room scale, the complex transient airflows generated during door-opening/closing motions and the passage of a human figure through the doorway between two rooms. This was a basic test case that was performed in an isothermal environment without ventilation. However, the advantage of the CFD approach is that the addition of ventilation airflows and a temperature difference between the rooms is, in principle, a relatively simple task. A standard method to observe flow structures is dosing smoke into the flow. In this paper we introduce graphical methods to simulate smoke experiments by LES, making it very easy to compare the CFD simulation to the experiments. The results demonstrate that the transient CFD simulation is a promising tool to compare different isolation room scenarios without the need to construct full-scale experimental models. The CFD model is able to reproduce the complex airflows and estimate the volume of air escaping as a function of time. In this test, the calculated migrated air volume in the CFD model differed by 20% from the experimental tracer gas measurements. In the case containing only a hinged door operation, without passage, the difference was only 10%.",

Concerns about airborne transmission have even been raised for Ebola virus during the current epidemic in West Africa, even though this virus is normally transmitted via direct contact [19] . It is this heightened awareness of the potential for airborne transmission of various infectious agents, together with the traditionally precautionary approach to infection control that means that patients infected with potentially highly contagious diseases are now being routinely quarantined in negative pressure isolation rooms to prevent further spreading of the disease, to protect patients, staff and visitors.",

            "text": "However, despite these precautions, containment failures can happen and the operation of the isolation room doors could be one of the main contributors [20] [21] [22] . A case study by Tang et al. [20] showed that the operation of isolation room doors can lead to containment failure. In the present study, the air migration from the isolation room induced by door-opening and passage has been modelled. Even though the air volume migrated (AVM) is closely connected to the number of pathogens potentially escaping, a linear dependence requires that the pathogens are aerosolized and fully airborne, and therefore capable of long-range transmission. Whilst this is the case for some infectious agents, others are transmitted by larger droplets, subject to gravitational settling. A recent review by Fernstrom and Goldblatt [23] summarizes the research on the aerobiology of infectious aerosols. The division between airborne and droplet transmission is complicated by the fact that in dry air, the droplets desiccate rapidly, leaving so-called droplet nuclei that are airborne. This may happen prior to the droplet/droplet nuclei reaching the floor. Or the droplet nuclei can be resuspended and become airborne again after settling onto a surface. The evaporation of water-containing droplets is significantly reduced in air of high humidity, making them more prone to settling under gravity [24] . According to the definition adopted by WHO, particles with a diameter of less than 5 \u03bcm are considered airborne. However, under normal air conditions, particles up to 50 \u03bcm dry out completely within 0.5 seconds, and particles up to 100 \u03bcm would totally evaporate before falling 2 m [25] . So droplets/particles of these diameters to begin with may quickly evaporate to fall within this socalled 'airborne' range. A human cough contains both droplets and fine, airborne particles that can be simulated by tracer gas [24] . The infectious droplet nuclei generated from human respiratory sources have a diameter 0.5-5 \u03bcm with average being less than 1 \u03bcm [26, 27] . The estimations about the extent to which airborne transmission contributes to the overall infection rates in hospitals vary from 10% to 30% [23] .",

Thus, the flow interactions arising from the moving door and human, alone, are presented, without any interference from any other sources. Addition of other factors such as ventilation, temperature differences between the rooms, or negative room pressure (i.e. unbalanced ventilation) would be a relatively simple next step. Flow structures near the doorway of the mock-up were examined and recorded in some detail by dosing smoke in one room and videoing its spread into the other room. Techniques were developed to construct similar simulated smoke videos from the LES results, enabling direct comparisons with the experimental videos. The ultimate purpose was to test the capability of time-resolved LES method to reproduce the full-scale air flows present in a real isolation room. The simulation was run on a standard workstation.",

Choi and Edwards [29] simulated a walking manikin going through an open doorway (i.e. in the absence of a door). In this study, they use their own immersed solid method [30] to model a walking human. They modelled several scenarios, varying the walking speed, initial position of the manikin, and initial distribution of the contaminant in the two rooms. The contaminant in their study consisted of particles, affected by gravity. The numerical methods used to solve the transport equations were also developed by the authors. In a later paper the same authors [31] simulated a more complex geometry, where a human is walking from a contaminated room to a clean room through a vestibule and two hinged or sliding doors. This simulation also includes ventilation (with an exhaust in the vestibule and small gaps below the doors), human plume, and several successive passages through the doors, with a gaseous contaminant. A clear advantage of the immersed solid methods is that they do not require re-meshing between the time steps, thereby allowing use of a large computational mesh. A study by Shih et al (case B in [32] ), applied dynamic meshing to model the effect of opening and closing of a sliding door, without passage, on the spread of CO 2 contaminant from a human source inside a negative-pressure isolation room. Since dynamic meshing is computationally heavier than the immersed solid technique, the size of the mesh was less than 100 000 cells, though it was enough to model the CO 2 isosurfaces.",

Their results were based on short door hold-opening times of the order of 1 s. In the isothermal case, without buoyancy, their formula reduces to AVM = 2.3 m 2 s U d , where U d is the velocity of the centre of the door. Tang et al.

The length of the time step was a constant 2 ms, until after 22.3 s of simulated time. Then after the door and nurse movements had ended, it was increased to 4 ms. The computational mesh was a pure tetra mesh comprising 11.7 million nodes (control volumes, corresponding to 68.7 million elements). In order to reduce the mesh size, a refined volume of approximately 6 m \u00d7 (1-2.4) m \u00d7 2 m (greater width near the volume swept by the door), or some 20% of the overall volume of the rooms, was created in the path of the moving nurse and door. A dense mesh is inevitable in this volume not only to resolve the air currents, but also because the immersed solid method applied uses the underlying mesh to resolve the surfaces of the moving objects. In the refined volume, a typical mesh element diameter was of the order of 1 cm, and the volumes of the finite volumes were 1.5\u00d710 \u22126 -2.5\u00d710 \u22126 m 3 . Away from the refined area, the volumes increased to 1.5\u00d710 \u22123 -4\u00d710 \u22123 m 3 . The discretization schemes used were second order backward Euler (transient scheme) and central difference (advection scheme). The two rooms together formed a closed system surrounded by wall boundary condition, and in the initial state the relative pressure as well as all the velocity components were set to zero everywhere. A 2 cm high gap was left below the door to avoid convergence problems in the beginning of the door-opening phase. This detail differed from the mock-up, where this gap was sealed by a moving seal that was automatically lifted when the door started to move.

The gases were initially dosed into different rooms, but mixing was taking place during repeated door and passage cycles, whereupon calculation of the AVMs from the measured concentrations was based on Eq (1). The concentrations of both the tracers in both the rooms were monitored by one gas analyzer (BK1302) taking the sample through sampling tubes that were perforated throughout their lengths. In addition, after the door had closed, the air in the rooms was mixed by fans. These actions were necessary to ensure the sample taken by the gas analyzer is representative of the overall conditions in the room. A third measure of confirmation was use of repeated measurements, as mentioned above. The door and passage cycle was repeated and measured 6 times (7 times in the case without passage). The results were scattered without a clear increasing or decreasing trend. To ensure proper flushing of the sampling tube, the gas analyzer took the sample from the exhaust tube of a more powerful pump. The photoacoustic sample cell of the analyzer was very small, with a volume of 3 cm 3 . It was flushed with a flow rate of 5 cm 3 /s, giving a time constant less than one second.

Smoke was then released into one of the rooms, where it stayed for a while, letting the temperature difference to vanish. The smoke was then neutrally buoyant. Since flow-driven transport phenomena dominate over diffusion, after the door-opening smoke was carried into the other room by the air flows in the same manner as the tracer gases. Similarly, simulated smoke would be a useful illustrative tool to simulate the flow structures predicted by LES. Moreover, comparison of simulated smoke videos and real camcorder shots would be an interesting method to qualitatively validate the CFD results. Similar propagation of smoke and tracer gas makes it possible to use the same passive scalar to represent them both in the LES simulation. When penetrating deeper into the smoke, into areas of larger concentration of smoke droplets, the light scattering becomes more and more effective. This means that the smoke becomes less and less transparent. This effect can be discretized by first dividing the smoke into a few nested volumes with different concentrations. Next, let us approximate that all the light scattering is taking place on the limiting surfaces between these volumes. Then only a few isosurfaces of tracer mass concentration need to be drawn and a negative correlation between the concentration and the transparency of the surface needs to be defined. This principle is illustrated in and they are shown with a frequency of 25 frames per second, we get a simulated smoke video in natural speed, easy to compare with an experimental one. An example is seen in S2 Video. It is a simulation combining two separate smoke experiments. Smoke escaping from the isolation room into the anteroom is coloured white, whereas smoke going the opposite way is coloured yellow, corresponding to a yellow light source. This video is based on a single CFD LES simulation, having different passive scalars dosed into each room in the initial state (corresponding to two tracer gases or two separate smoke experiments). Table 1 lists the isosurfaces and their transparencies, common to both passive scalars, used in preparing the video. There are no strict rules for the selection of these quantities. The only requirement is that different layers should be seen through each other in a natural-looking way. The video corresponds to situations where the rooms are entirely lit. It displays some basic flow structures, such as the jet through the gap below the door starting to open, the door vortices, and the wake of air the nurse is dragging behind her. It is comparable with the latter part of S3 Video by Tang et al. [22] , showing the same features except that there is not a similar gap below the door.",

Depending on the source, either a large volume, a strip, or only a narrow sheet of the smoke may be lit. When simulating the last-mentioned case, the isosurfaces reduce to isolines, since practically only a two-dimensional cross-section is lit. Then it is a better idea to plot a simple contour plot of the tracer (mass) concentration using a greyscale colour map. An example of this strategy is shown in Fig 3. It shows an instantaneous greyscale map of the tracer gas concentration near a closing door. The higher the tracer concentration, the whiter the hue, simulating the smaller transparency or the more intense scattering of light by smoke droplets. The door vortex is clearly visible behind the door.",

It is also assumed the view direction is approximately parallel to the same coordinate axis. Then the light scattering can be easily discretized in the view direction by drawing several partially transparent greyscale maps above each other. An example is presented in Fig 4. In the figure, four xy-oriented greyscale contour maps are drawn. Their transparency is increasing from bottom to top, so that when viewing from above, all the planes can be seen through each other. This creates an illusion of an illuminated horizontal thick zone of smoke. The method of contour maps is simpler and requires less computing than the method of isosurfaces, but is not suitable in a general case, where the line of sight is oblique. ",

This quantity can be easily calculated by Eq (1) from a tracer gas measurement, or by integrating the amount of tracer gas 2 in room 1 in a simulation, see Eqs (2) and (3). A LES simulation provides more detailed information than measurements here in that it gives the AVM as a function of time. The upper plot in Fig 5 shows the AVM(t) curve given by LES, together with the total AVMs obtained from a series of tracer gas measurements. A very intense flow through the doorway can be seen at the very beginning of the door-opening phase. This is due to the piston effect of the moving door, which in the beginning reduces the air volume in the isolation room. This effect causes a rapid counter-flow through the gap between the door and its frame. In the CFD simulation a 2 cm high gap was left below the door to avoid convergence problems. Another occasion of intense flow occurs when the nurse passes through the doorway. This is also the moment when the two AVM curves \u0394V 1!2 (t) and \u0394V 2!1 (t) separate, because the air displaced by the nurse moves from room 1 to room 2. The separation between the curves equals the volume of the nurse, which in this simulation was 0.070 m 3 (generally, with a good precision, one litre per one kilogram of mass). Finally, the AVM curve of Then the total AVM would be 0.66 m 3 , which is almost exactly the same as the result by Kiel and Wilson. One should however note that the door used by Kiel and Wilson was an exterior door, not an interior door as in our case, and their data were rather scattered. In addition, Kiel and Wilson warn in their paper that their result for AVM due to door-pumping is not properly non-dimensionalized for the door size, and is therefore only valid for width W near 0.91 m used in their experiments. In our case W is 24% larger than this.",

It is not, of course, equivalent to the AVM due to human passage in the absence of the door operation. The value of this difference was 0.54 m 3 in the measurements and 0.30 m 3 in the simulations. Our measurements with a sliding door, with much less disturbance by the door itself, resulted in additional AVM of 0.92 m 3 -0.56 m 3 = 0.36 m 3 generated by the passage [28, 35] . This suggests that the human wake is an important agent in air transport. Concerning the relative proportion of the air volume of one room, migrating into the other room, Choi and Edwards [29] obtained a percentage of 2.5 in the case of walking speed 1 m/s and in the absence of the door. This means an AVM of 0.98 m 3 . This result was obtained 6 s after the human stopped, which makes it approximately comparable with the final AVM in our case. Also, the human stopped at 3.2 m from the doorway, while in the present study it stopped already at the distance of 2 m. Taking into account the deceleration ramp in our simulation, the time from the moment the nurse passes the doorway to the moment the door is half-closed is 8.45 s. In the paper of Choi and Edward, the time from the moment the human passes the doorway to the moment the AVM is measured, is 9.2 s. Thus, the time of influence of the wake is nearly the same in both simulations. However, their rooms and doorway were smaller than in our study (39.2 m 3 against 56.4 m 3 and 1.74 m 2 against 2.23 m 2 ). Tang et al. [21] estimated a range of values for the flux of the wake induced by a moving human, being 0.08-0.23 m 3 /s, though this estimate does not appear to take into consideration how the flux behaves over time during the passage and after the nurse has stopped moving.",

It was noted then that reducing the opening-speed (in the absence of ventilation) resulted in larger AVM, or that the effect of increased duration overrode the effect of faster door movement. Moreover, without passage the air escape through the doorway continued at nearly constant speed up to the longest holdopen time tested (25 s). A similar effect has been found by Hathway et al. [37] who studied doorway flows generated by a single hinged-door in a small-scale water tank model. The effect of opening angle (90\u00b0vs 45\u00b0tested) was smaller, but clearly detectable. By contrast, the effect of a 2\u00b0C temperature difference between the two rooms resulted in 41% increase in the AVM in the case used in the CFD simulation [35] .",

The effect of ventilation on the pathogen transmission is reviewed in the WHO guideline [25] , based on 65 selected studies. It was obvious that the information about the impact of different types of ventilation on the reduction of infectious risks is insufficient. The main findings were that while insufficient ventilation increases the disease transmission and high ventilation rates could decrease it, there is no information that droplet-transmitted infections can be reduced by increasing ventilation rate. On the other hand, there is not enough data to define a minimum ventilation flow rate against infections through droplet nuclei (concluded also by Li et al [38] ).",

Guidelines for isolation rooms do not recommend any particular ventilation strategy, but require keeping the room at negative pressure differential [40] . Kim and Augenbroe [41] suggest satisfying this by adaptive VAV (Variable Air Volume) operation, normally maintaining a low negative pressure differential, but temporarily inducing a higher value prior to door operation, to reduce energy consumption. As demonstrated by Adams et al [42] , containment failure during door operation and passage can be significantly reduced by applying pressure difference. Even though the pressure differential immediately disappears when the door is opened, the supply and exhaust air flow differential, used to generate the underpressure in the isolation room, remains and works against the flow escaping from the isolation room.",

The use of LES is attractive, since it enables the air flow features to be made visible, e.g. by using the simulated smoke method, as introduced in this study. Even though the present case was a simple, isothermal basic case without ventilation, the addition of ventilation would not be difficult and would not require much additional computing. In fact, this would be a natural continuation of this study. The effect of temperature differences between the rooms may be even greater than that of ventilation, and its effect could also be easily simulated. Finally, the thermal plume of the nurse (when not moving) has not been taken into account in this simulation, but this could also be simulated and should be taken into account in future models.",

A greyscale contour map of the concentration of a passive scalar on a cross-sectional plane is equivalent to illuminating a thin sheet of smoke by white light. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0130667.g003 Isolation Rooms and Simulated Smoke Videos revealed that the AVM grows steadily over an extended period of time during the hold-open phase, see Kalliom\u00e4ki et al. [28, 35]. From the lower plot of Fig 5, the total simulated volume of air migrated in the door-opening phase (duration 3 s) is 0.412 m 3 . In the door-closing phase the flow continued at almost unchanged rate, the volume of air migrated being 0.327 m 3 . These volumes total to approximately 0.74 m 3 by door-pumping alone, with the hold-open phase omitted. Including a hold-open time of 1 s, probably used by Kiel and Wilson [33], would increase the AVM to approximately 0.81 m 3. The analytical formula introduced by Kiel and Wilson would give AVM = 2.3 m 2 s U d = 0.68 m 3 , which is rather near the simulated value. Here, one should note that in our case the door-closing time was longer (5.4 s) than the opening time (3 s), while they were obviously identical in the experiments of Kiel and Wilson. Since the flow rate stays almost constant during the closing phase, we can approximate that a closing time of 3 s would have resulted in air volume of",
