Resilience operationalisations have been reviewed in a cross-sectional context; however, a review of longitudinal methods of operationalising resilience has not been conducted. The present study conducts a systematic review across Scopus and Web of Science capturing studies of ageing that posited operational definitions of resilience in longitudinal studies of ageing. Thirty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Non-acute events, for example, cancer, were the most common form of adversity identified and psychological components, for example, the absence of depression, the most common forms of positive adaptation. Of the included studies, 4 used psychometrically driven methods, that is, repeated administration of established resilience metrics, 9 used definition-driven methods, that is, a priori establishment of resilience components and criteria, and 23 used datadriven methods, that is, techniques that identify resilient individuals using latent variable models. Acknowledging the strengths and limitations of each operationalisation is integral to the appropriate application of these methods to life course and longitudinal resilience research.",

[4] [5] [6] Longitudinal studies capture at least three waves of data and are able to provide data that illuminate trends that occur over time. 7 Many variables are not static, interacting dynamically and changing over time; therefore, longitudinal methods must be employed to disentangle these relationships. Consequently, these studies provide greater insights into the nature of a phenomenon than is possible with cross-sectional methods or two-wave pre-post follow-up designs. 7 Longitudinal studies that employ psychometrically driven methods repeatedly administer previously validated resilience scales such as the widely used Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. 8 These methods have been developed under the assumption that resilience is a universal concept that can be operationalised uniformly across populations and age groups using a single scale. Thresholds may be applied to identify resilient individuals, but generally resilience is captured on a continuum. Whereas the definition-driven and data-driven approaches to longitudinal data are used to identify resilient individuals based on dynamic measures of adaptation, repeat observations of resilience captured by psychometric scales are used to describe continuity or change in resilience over time.",

Non-acute events were the most common source of adversity and the absence of psychological distress over time the most prominent source of positive adaptation. However, positive adaptation has primarily been measured by the absence of psychopathology and there have been no studies specifically measuring positive mental adaptation and well-being. Several limitations must be acknowledged in the interpretation of these results. The present study intends to provide a comprehensive overview of methods used to capture resilience in studies that have specifically used the term 'resilience'. Similar phrases or terms used by authors that may have intended to capture resilience, for example, hardiness or resistance, would not have been included in the present study. This may apply more to biomedically oriented disciplines where the term resilience is not as embedded in the description of responses to adversity as it is in psychologically oriented disciplines. In addition to the general resilience term, there are a number of 50 A prototypical resilience trajectory, that is, decreasing functioning followed by a return to pre-event functioning, was also identified. 38 GHQ, General Health Questionnaire; HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; 51 POWs, prisoners of war; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.",

In the interest of making direct comparisons of resilience operationalisations, only studies that specifically used the term 'resilience' as a standalone construct were included. Consequently, this may have prevented the inclusion of other forms of resilience and predisposed the positive adaption variables towards psychological outcomes. Although the majority of studies captured in this review examined protective factors for resilience, an analysis of these factors has not been included due to the heterogeneity of adversity/adaptation dyads and operationalisation methods. Protective factors are likely specific to the particular definition and therefore are not necessarily generalisable across all resilience definitions. Psychometrically driven models of resilience used previously established, continuous measures of resilience. These models have primarily been used in cross-sectional studies and the resilience scales used have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties; 5 6 however, four studies in the present review used these metrics longitudinally. Of note, these studies did not have resilience as their primary focus, but rather used resilience as one of many outcome variables. These methods are effective in that they capture a continuous measure of resilience using previously validated psychometrics and permit a high level of granularity (ie, ability to provide detailed information). For existing studies that include resilience scales and for prospective studies, this is an effective means of operationalising resilience; however, these operationalisations are not possible for researchers using secondary data sets that have not previously administered these scales.",

These methods can be applied in any circumstance in which an adversity-adaptation dyad using categorical or continuous variables exists, which is advantageous for researchers using secondary data.

In existing secondary data sets, the application of specific resilience definitions is limited to the variables captured in the study.

Given that resilience cannot be directly measured, latent variable modelling techniques were employed, the most popular of these being GMM. Latent variable modelling is a meritorious method of identifying resilient individuals due to the removal of researcher-defined thresholds, that is, greater objectivity, and the ability to categorise individuals into different relative trajectories. In contrast to definition-driven methods that employ a series of components and thresholds, latent variable modelling allows group membership to be determined based on the characteristics of individuals in the sample relative to each other rather than relative to an external criterion. This is useful in unpicking different levels of resilience using person-centred methods, that is, study participants with similar performances, rather than variable-centred methods, that is, participants who perform above or below an a priori threshold on a variable, as in definition-driven methods. Studies in the present review generally captured three waves of data over an average of 5 years; however, when more follow-up data waves are available, data-driven methods are better able to represent changing trajectories than definition-driven methods that posit binary states. Therefore, in circumstances with many repeat waves of data collection with continuous variables, datadriven methods are recommended over definition-driven methods in the articulation of resilience.",

Definition-driven methods employ situation-specific thresholds for continuous and categorical adaptation-adversity dyads. To date, these models have had low granularity due to the application of binary models and many have demonstrated limited generalisability due to study-specific constituent components of resilience and thresholds used. Data-driven methods employ person-centred statistical procedures to group similar individuals, using the granularity of continuous variables. These methods provide a level of objective classification; however, the subjectivity of model fit interpretation and situation-specific nature of the trajectories inhibits generalisability.
