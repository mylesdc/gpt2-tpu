The GBD 2013 reports that the global prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis has increased 174% since 1990, with much of that increase attributed to a sharp uptick in the number of cases in the EMR [8, 9] .

Compared to the years before the Syrian conflict, for instance, the numbers of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases are thought to have since increased 2-5-fold to over 100,000 cases in 2014 alone, due to the stoppage of vector control activities and the creation of new sand fly breeding sites amid the bombed-out rubble in cities such as Aleppo [13] . Subsequently, some indoor residual spraying has resumed so that the expected numbers of new cases may not be as high [13] . However, cutaneous leishmaniasis remains hyperendemic in Syria, and the reemergence of visceral leishmaniasis has now also been noted [13] .",

We therefore need to identify mechanisms to isolate or control the NTDs now emerging from the conflict zones and promote better cooperation between the warring factions for this purpose.

First, greater cooperation between the OIC nations could increase access to essential medicines for mass treatment of the NTDs, including intestinal helminth infections, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma. Today, in some of the African Sahelian OIC nations, only a small percentage of the at-risk populations (including children) benefit from regular and periodic mass drug administration. This problem could be addressed through increased financial support and technical cooperation among OIC nations.",

We need new vaccines for leishmaniasis, coronavirus infections, viral HFs, and other diseases. In terms of nations adjacent to Middle East conflict zones, currently both Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, have substantial capacities for vaccine biotechnology. We need to do better tapping into those strengths. In my role during 2015 and 2016 as United States science envoy for the State Department and White House, I worked to expand collaborations between the US and Saudi Arabia, now leading to joint scientific activities in the area of vaccine development. But such initiatives in the area of vaccine diplomacy need to be expanded. Could US-Saudi vaccine diplomacy extend to other nations? It would be worthwhile to also explore the inclusion of other nations in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, particularly those that do not have historical connections to Saudi Arabia. In so doing, vaccine diplomacy could become a key 21st-century theme to address regional NTDs arising out of conflict and to promote international cooperation in the region and among the OIC nations.",
