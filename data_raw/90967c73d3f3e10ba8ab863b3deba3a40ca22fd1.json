The mechanism of how picornavirus infection interferes with ERAD remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection significantly inhibits cellular ERAD by targeting multiple key ERAD molecules with its proteases 2A pro and 3C pro using different mechanisms. Ubc6e was identified as the key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in EV71 disturbed ERAD. EV71 3C pro cleaves Ubc6e at Q219G, Q260S, and Q273G. EV71 2A pro mainly inhibits the de novo synthesis of key ERAD molecules Herp and VIMP at the protein translational level. Herp differentially participates in the degradation of different glycosylated ERAD substrates \u03b1-1 antitrypsin Null Hong Kong (NHK) and the Cterminus of sonic hedgehog (SHH-C) via unknown mechanisms. p97 was identified as a host factor in EV71 replication; it redistributed and co-exists with the viral protein and other known replication-related molecules in EV71-induced replication organelles. Electron microscopy and multiple-color confocal assays also showed that EV71-induced membranous vesicles were closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the ER membrane molecule RTN3 was redistributed to the viral replication complex during EV71 infection. Therefore, we propose that EV71 rearranges ER membranes and hijacks p97 from cellular ERAD to benefit its replication. These findings add to our understanding of how viruses disturb ERAD and provide potential anti-viral targets for EV71 infection. , et al.

The protein quality control system, which consists of ERAD and autophagic degradation, is necessary for cellular homeostasis. Our previous studies and others have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the EV71 lifecycle, but the role of ERAD remains unclear. In this study, we found that EV71 infection also significantly inhibits physiological ERAD at multiple points, causing ERAD substrates to remain tethered in the ER lumen. When exploring the mechanism of EV71induced ERAD inhibition, data revealed that EV71-encoded viral proteases 2A pro and 3C pro are involved, and they target different molecules with different mechanisms. We also found that ERAD component p97 was essential for the EV71 lifecycle, and it redistributed and co-exists with viral protein and other known replication-related molecules in EV71-induced replication organelles. Thus, we found a novel viral-host interaction that provides new potential anti-viral targets for EV71 infection.",

This pathogen is the causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and is especially the major cause of severe HFMD. Since the first report in the United States in 1974, EV71 outbreaks have been reported around the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years [2] . In China, EV71 caused a severe HFMD outbreak in Fuyang, Anhui province in 2008, and has since become an epidemic problem [3] . The frequency and severity of HFMD have shown an increased annual trend and pose a serious threat to children's health and social stability in China [4] . However, no effective therapy is currently available for the treatment of this infection and more studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of EV71.",

This process consists of four coupled steps: (i) substrate recognition; (ii) retro-translocation; (iii) ubiquitination; and (iv) 26S proteasome-mediated degradation [16, 30, 31] . Since ERAD is a key cellular machinery for ensuring correct cell function, it is unsurprising that viruses can manipulate this process for their own benefit. Previous studies demonstrated that different viruses can affect and exploit the ERAD process in different manners [28, [31] [32] [33] [34] . There are four reasons why viruses exploit ERAD. First, to escape the immune surveillance system by eliminating immune molecules; examples include herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [28, 32] . Second, viruses take advantage of ERAD to achieve the membrane penetration of intact viruses from the ER to the cytosol, such as simian virus 40 (SV40), human BK virus, and murine polymavirus [28, 32] . Third, viruses promote ERAD tuning and hijack EDEMosomes to support their replication, including coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [32, [35] [36] [37] . Finally, viruses can activate ERAD to degrade viral glycoproteins and thereby reduce the viral particle and maintain a chronic infection status; examples include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [32, 38, 39] . However, despite the numerous studies mentioned above, no reports have investigated the relationship between picornaviruses and ERAD.",

To address this question, we first categorized the ERAD substrates according to their different chaperone systems and established stable cell lines ectopically expressing these substrates.

Transthyretin D18G (the 18th D amino acid mutated to G; TTR D18G) and non-secretory immunoglobulin kappa-type light chain (NS1 \u03ba LC) were selected as representative. TTR is a non-glycosylated soluble secretory protein and TTR D18G is the most destabilized mutant of TTR that is subject to ERAD [48, 49] . NS1 \u03ba LC is an unassembled immunoglobulin light chain that is degraded through ERAD [50] . RD cells stably expressing TTR D18G and NS1 \u03ba LC were treated with CHX and their degradation was assessed. The degradation of both substrates was remarkably inhibited in a time-dependent manner during EV71 infection (Fig 1C and 1D ), suggesting that EV71 infection also inhibits the ERAD of BiP substrates. It is worth noting that high molecular weight bands of TTR D18G were visible (Fig 1C) , which we demonstrated were glycosylated forms of TTR D18G by treating cell lysates with glycosidase PNGase F (S2 Fig). In EV71-infected cells, the molecular weight of glycosylated TTR D18G was decreased, and we speculate that is due to extensive mannose trimming.",

The results showed that the proportion of apoptosis was 28.6% in cells infected with EV71 for 17 h, and the combined treatment with CHX for the last 8 h only slightly upregulated the proportion to 32.2% (S1C Fig). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that EV71 infection inhibits the ERAD of different types of substrates, including both CNX/CRT-dependent glycosylated substrates and BiP-dependent non-glycosylated substrates and cellular constitutively and endogenously expressed substrates. , and NS1\u03ba LC-FLAG (D) were mock-infected (\u2212) or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for different times. Nine hours post-infection the cells were treated with CHX (100 \u03bcg/ml) for the indicated times. The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by western blotting with indicated antibodies to detect the substrates, EV71 2C, and actin; actin was used as the loading control (left panel). The graph shows the quantification of the relative substrate (right panel). The data EV71 infection caused ERAD substrates to be tethered in the ER Since ERAD is a process that detects misfolded proteins in the ER and extracts them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation [16, 32] , we next assessed the location of ERAD substrates in EV71-infected cells. First, SHH-C was used as the substrate. SHH-C is a glycosylated protein that undergoes deglycosylation when retro-translocated to the cytosol. The accumulation of deglycosylated SHH-C when the proteasome is inhibited reflects its retro-translocation degree [43] [44] [45] . In cells not treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the deglycosylated SHH-C was not detected in either mock-or EV71-infected cells. However, when cells were treated with MG132, deglycosylated SHH-C was visible as a low-molecular weight band in mockinfected cells, but was barely detectable in EV71-infected cells (Fig 2A) . This suggests that the retro-translocation of SHH-C was inhibited by EV71 infection and that SHH-C could be trapped inside the ER lumen.",

            "text": "To further confirm the above conclusion, a previously reported dislocation-dependent reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay was used to evaluate different substrates, and the principle of this system is illustrated in Fig 2B. Briefly, the GFP molecule is split into two fragments: the Cterminal \u03b2-strand (S11) and the remaining 10\u03b2 strands (S1-10). The S11 is linked to ERAD substrates expressed in the ER lumen, and S1-10 is expressed in the cytosol. When S11-tagged substrates are retro-translocated into the cytosol, S11 is reassembled with S1-10, and the resulting GFP signal is detected when the coupled proteasome degradation is inhibited ( Fig  2B) [52] . First, the drGFP assay was used to determine the location of SHH-C in EV71-infected cells. The results showed that in cells not treated with MG132, no GFP signal was observed in either mock-infected or EV71-infected cells. However, the reconstituted GFP signal could be detected in MG132-treated mock-infected cells, but not in EV71-infected cells (Fig 2C) . This suggests that EV71 inhibited the retro-translocation activity of SHH-C and that this substrate was trapped inside the ER during infection. The same method was also used to test the retrotranslocation activity of NHK and TTR D18G during EV71 infection, and similar results were obtained (Fig 2D and 2E ). The drGFP assay was not used to evaluate substrate NS1 \u03ba LC since previous studies reported that NS1 \u03ba LC was retained in the ER lumen and not translocated to the cytosol when cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor [53] . The above experiments were performed with RD cells expressing different substrates infected with EV71 up to 18 h, and we also used flow cytometry to monitor cell apoptosis under this situation. The results showed that EV71 infection for 18 h caused apoptosis in 30.4% cells, and combined treatment with MG132 in the last 8 h slightly downregulated this proportion (S3 Fig). Taken together, the above results demonstrated that both CNX-dependent glycosylated substrates and BiP-dependent non-glycosylated substrates were trapped inside the ER during EV71 infection. Therefore, they could not be retro-translocated to the cytosol to undergo subsequent proteasomal degradation.",

The molecules examined were classified into four categories: (1) recognition factors (calnexin, calreticulin, BiP, EDEM1, OS9, and XTP3-B); (2) retro-translocation factors (SEL1L, Herp, Derl1, and Derl2); (3) ubiquitination factors (Hrd1, gp78, RNF5, Ubc6e/UBE2J1, and Ubc7/ UBE2G2); and (4) proteasomal degradation factors (VIMP, UBXD8, p97, Ufd1, and Npl4) [16, 30, 31] (Fig 3A) . As expected, EV71 infection downregulated the expression of several molecules in a time-dependent manner, including Herp, Hrd1, Ubc6e, VIMP, and UBXD8 ( Fig  3B) . Among these, two bands that seemed like cleavage products of Ubc6e could be detected around 25-26 kDa in molecular weight, and their intensity increased as the infection proceeded. Cleavage bands were also detected in the blot of UBXD8, but not in the blots of Herp, Hrd1, and VIMP ( Fig 3C) .",

Ubc6e forms an E2-E3 pair with Hrd1 and is considered the principal E2 in cellular ERAD [54] [55] [56] . To further clarify the precise mechanism by which Ubc6e is cleaved, we investigated whether EV71-encoded viral proteases 2A pro and 3C pro participate in this process. These viral proteases are responsible for cleaving poly-protein precursors to obtain mature viral proteins, and increasing amounts of evidence have demonstrated that they could cleave various host factors to facilitate viral replication [1, 4, 5, 13] . First, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EV71 3C pro or a protease-dead mutant of 3C pro (C147S), and Ubc6e cleavage was detected by western blotting. Overexpressed 3C pro , but not 3C pro (C147S), could cleave Ubc6e in a dose-dependent manner, and the cleavage bands were the same molecular weight as in EV71-infected cells (Fig 4A) . This result was also achieved by in vitro cleavage assay with recombinant 3C pro and its protease-dead mutant 3C pro (E71A) (Fig 4B) . We also tested the role of 2A pro in Ubc6e cleavage, and the result showed that no cleavage bands were detected in 2A pro -transfected cells (S5 Fig) . This suggests that EV71 3C pro cleaves Ubc6e during infection.",

The results showed that SHH-C degradation was inhibited gradually with the increasing expression of EV71 3C pro ( Fig 4C) . However, the inhibitory effects were not as potent as EV71 infection. This might be due to the limited transfection efficiency of the overexpressed EV71 3C pro , or it could be because Ubc6e cleavage is only one of the factors that inhibit ERAD, and other factors could also be involved.

Since picornavirus 3C pro preferentially cleaves glutamine-glycine (Q-G), glutamine-alanine (Q-A), and glutamine-serine (Q-S) bonds in viral polyproteins and cellular targets [11, 57] , a panel of site-directed mutants with Q mutated to A within the 200-300 amino acid (aa) region was constructed. Then, 293T cells were co-transfected with the GFP-3C pro and Ubc6e/Ubc6e mutants to map the cleavage sites. As illustrated in Fig 4F, all the mutants could be cleaved by 3C pro as before. However, the cleavage bands from mutant Q219A were shifted to a molecular weight of~30 kDa ( Fig 4F) . This indicates that the 219 th glutamine of Ubc6e (Q219) is one of the cleavage sites and that another cleavage site(s) exists that is located closer to the C-terminus of Ubc6e. To further identify the remaining cleavage sites, a new panel of double-site mutants (Q to A) was constructed within the 219-300 aa region based on the Q219A mutant. These series mutants revealed that all the double-site mutants could be cleaved by 3C pro ; however, the cleavage bands were changed in cells transfected with mutant Q219Q260A and Q219Q273A. This indicates that both Q260 and Q273 are the cleavage sites of 3C pro on Ubc6e ( Fig 4G) . To further confirm this result, a third round of screening was conducted using triple-site Q to A mutants that were generated based on Q219Q260A including Q219Q260Q262A and Q219Q260Q273A. The results showed that triple-site mutant Q219Q260Q273A was totally resistant to 3C pro cleavage; thus, Q260 and Q273 were identified as the second and third cleavage sites ( Fig 4H) . Taken together, the above results demonstrate that EV71 3C pro cleaves Ubc6e at Q219G, Q260S, and Q273G. These sites are all located on the cytoplasmic side of Ubc6e, and cleavage at these points will lead to the release of the E2 catalytic domain of Ubc6e into the cytosol and inactive Ubc6e at the ER membranes. When all the cleavage sites were identified, we re-analyzed the results of Fig 4E-4G and speculated that each cleavage fragment was accompanied by a phosphorylated form with a lower migrating speed [58, 59] . We also confirmed this by treating cell lysates with phosphatase and detected the cleavage of Ubc6e; the results showed that both the dual-band of Ubc6e and cleaved Ube6e changed to a singleband when treated with phosphatase ( Fig 4I) .",

Herp, whose expression is strongly induced by the unfolded protein response (UPR), is involved in the turnover of ERAD substrates [60] [61] [62] . It participates in building the dislocation machinery around Hrd1 and itself has a very fast turnover [44, [63] [64] [65] . To further explore the reason behind the Herp reduction, we first assessed whether the reduction of Herp was caused by accelerated degradation or blocked synthesis. Mock-and EV71-infected after transfection, the cells were treated with (+) or without (\u2212) CHX for 4 h. Mock-and EV71-infected cells were used as the negative and positive controls for Ubc6e cleavage, respectively. Cells lysates were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against Flag, Ubc6e, EV71 3C, and Actin. Arrows indicate the cleavage fragments (CF) of Ubc6e.

Tg and Tun induced Herp expression efficiently in mockinfected cells, but the extent of upregulation was reduced by 2/3 in EV71-infected cells. However, there were no differences of basal Herp expression between mock-and EV71-infected cells ( Fig 5B) .

It is an important component of the ERAD complex because it can recruit p97 and other cofactors to the ER membrane for retro-translocation [67] [68] [69] . A CHX chase assay revealed that VIMP is a shortlived protein, similar to Herp (S4 Fig). Therefore, it is possible that EV71 inhibits VIMP and Herp expression via a similar mechanism. To confirm this, the BSRT7 cell line was transfected with EV71 2A, and VIMP expression was monitored at both the mRNA and protein levels. The results showed that there were no differences of VIMP mRNA expression between GFP and 2A-transfected cells (Fig 5D) . However, the protein expression of VIMP was significantly downregulated in 2A-transfected cells, but not GFP and 2A(C110A)-transfected cells at the protein level, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5E) , suggesting that the EV71 2A pro also inhibits the protein synthesis of VIMP.",

Although 2A pro of picornaviruses is well known to inhibit cap-dependent host cell translation by cleaving several host factors related to the translation process [4, 5, 7, 8] , we thought that its effect on host cell protein expression mainly embodied on short-lived proteins, like Herp and VIMP in this study. We also included c-MYC, another reported shortlived protein [70, 71] , and p97, which is not short-lived, as controls and detected their expression in 2A-and 2A(C110A)-transfected cells. As expected, the expression of c-MYC but not p97 was downregulated in 2A-transfected cells (Fig 5E) . We next evaluated of Herp and Ubc6e in the degradation of different ERAD substrates. First, their role in the degradation of SHH-C was examined. RD cells stably expressing SHH were transfected with siRNA to silence Ube6e and Herp. The cells were then chased with CHX under mock-or EV71-infection conditions and the degradation of SHH-C was assessed by western blotting. Knocking down Ubc6e but not Herp significantly inhibited the degradation of SHH-C under CHX chase in RD cells (Fig 6A) , suggesting that the ERAD of SHH-C was Ubc6e-dependent and Herp-independent. It is worth noting that silencing Ubc6e substantially upregulated the expression of Herp, suggesting that Ubc6e is a critical modulator of Herp degradation. Next, the same method was used to evaluate the role of Ubc6e and Herp in NHK degradation. The results differed to those of SHH-C, since knocking down either Ubc6e or Herp inhibited the degradation of NHK (Fig 6B) . This suggests that both Ubc6e and Herp are required for its degradation. Moreover, since the E2 responsible for NHK ERAD has not yet been identified, this study strongly suggests that Ubc6e is also the E2 for NHK degradation.",

To clarify the significance of EV71 inhibiting cellular ERAD, we first examined whether key ERAD components could impact the lifecycle of EV71. Although Ubc6e and Herp are viral targets of cellular ERAD, our above results showed their knockdown did not change viral protein expression in infected cells (Fig 6A-6E ). So we further checked the viral RNA in Ubc6e or Herp knockdown cells, and the result showed that viral RNA replication was not affected by their knockdown (Fig 7A) . Then we used siRNA to silence different ERAD components besides of Ubc6e and Herp and checked their role in EV71 replication. The results showed that the depletion of ATPase p97 remarkably inhibited EV71 replication, and the depletion of p97 cofactor Npl4 had a slight inhibitory effect (Fig 7B) . This suggests that the p97 complex, and especially p97 itself, is a critical host factor that is required for EV71 replication. To further explore whether the ATPase activity of p97 is required for EV71 replication, N2, N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2, 4-diamine (DBeQ), a reversible small molecule inhibitor, and p97 dominant negative mutant (p97QQ) [52, 72] , were used. Pretreating RD cells with DBeQ and transfecting RD cells with p97QQ remarkably attenuated EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7C and 7D) , suggesting that ATPase activity is required for EV71 replication.",

Since 2BC and 3AB protein of poliovirus were also reported interact with p97 [73] , the interaction of p97 and 2C we observed in EV71 infected cells may be indirectly and mediated by other viral proteins.

Taken together, these data suggest that EV71-induced ROs are closely interrelated with the ER, and that the membranes of ROs originated from the ER.

            "text": "In this study, we extensively investigated the impact of EV71 on ERAD and reported a novel relationship between the virus and cellular ERAD. These findings are summarized in Fig 10. In previous studies, all the reported relationships between viruses and cellular ERAD are common in that the viruses use the ERAD machinery for their own benefit [28, [31] [32] [33] . However, EV71 uses a totally different strategy to influence cellular ERAD. It inhibits ERAD via viral proteases, thoroughly suppresses physiological ERAD at multiple points. EV71 then hijacks host factor p97 and utilizes ER-derived membrane components from the disabled ERAD machinery to form its own replication organelles. In this study, we found that EV71 viral protein expression and viral RNA replication did not change in Ubc6e or Herp knockdown cells, although degradation of ERAD substrates was inhibited. We thought this was because the damage to ER caused by Ubc6e or Herp knockdown was relatively mild when compared to EV71 infection, and the ER membranes were not rearranged under this situation. However, in EV71 infected cells, ERAD was inhibited at multiple points, and ER homeostasis UBXD8, p97, Npl4, and Ufd1. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were mock infected (\u2212) or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. Then, western blotting was carried out to detect the knockdown efficiency of different molecules, EV71 2C, and actin. (C) RD cells were pre-treated with increasing doses of DBeQ (0-10 \u03bcM) for 3 h and then mock-infected (\u2212) or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. The cell lysates were then analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Herp expression was used as an indicator of DBeQ efficiency, and actin was used as the loading control. (D) RD cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or p97QQ-FLAG (dominant negative p97 mutant). At 36 h after transfection, the cells were mock-infected (\u2212) or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h, and the cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (E) RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h, and immunostaining was then performed to detect the intracellular distribution of p97 and EV71 2C (p97, green; 2C, red; nuclei, blue). Insets show magnified views of the merged channels in the boxed region. (F) RD cells were mock infected (\u2212) or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with p97 mouse monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG. Cell lysates and precipitates were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against p97 and EV71 2C. (G) 293T cells were cotransfected with empty vector (control) or plasmids encoding 2C-HA and p97-FLAG. At 36 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies. The cell lysates and precipitates were then analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against p97-FLAG and 2C-HA.",

To date, three E2s (Ubc6e/UBE2J1, UBE2J2, and UBE2G2) and five principal E3s (Hrd1, gp78, RMA1, TEB4, and TRC8) have been identified in the mammalian ERAD system [29, [54] [55] [56] 87] . Among these, Hrd1 forms an E3-E2 pair with Ubc6e and gp78 forms an E3-E2 pair with UBE2G2. These two E3-E2 pairs are considered the main executors of substrate ubiquitination in ERAD and they have distinct substrate specificities that are determined by the E3s [56] . The current results revealed that EV71 infection caused both Ubc6e cleavage and Hrd1 downregulation and thus totally destroyed the Hrd1-Ubc6e E3-E2 pair. We also investigated the gp78-UBE2G2 pair, but there were no obvious changes in these two molecules during EV71 infection (Fig 2B) , indicating that the Ubc6e-Hrd1 E2-E3 pair is the key ubiquitination element targeted by EV71 during infection. We attempted to reconstitute a functional ERAD system in EV71-infected cells by co-transfecting cells with a 3C proresistant mutant of Ubc6e (Q219Q260Q273A) and WT Hrd1. However, this could not rescue the inhibited ERAD process (S8 Fig), suggesting that EV71 inhibits ERAD in a comprehensive manner that involves multiple factors. The decrease of Hrd1 and the cleavage of UBXD8 found in our study are examples. We also checked the role of EV71 2A pro and 3C pro in the cleavage of UBXD8 but the results excluded their role (S4 Fig) and our future work will focus on the specific mechanisms.",

This discrepancy might be caused by the different silencing efficiencies of the methods used by the two groups. We used siRNA to knock down Ubc6e while Hagiwara et al. used Ubc6e knock-out MEFs. As described by Hagiwara et al. themselves, very little UBC6e suffices to properly regulate ERAD enhancers [88] . When using siRNA, knockdown of Ubc6e was not complete, and the remaining Ubc6e was sufficient to maintain the proper expression level of ERAD enhancers.

Specifically, Herp was involved in the ERAD of the BiP substrates NS1 \u03ba LC and TTRD18G and the calnexin substrate NHK, but not another calnexin substrate SHH-C. This suggests that other signatures but not the binding chaperone and glycosylation determine the substrate specificity of Herp.

(A) In normal cells, different substrates are degraded through different pathways: the calnexin/ calreticulin substrate SHH-C is degraded through a Herp-independent pathway, and the calnexin/calreticulin substrate NHK and the BiP substrates TTR D18G, NS1\u03ba LC, and endogenous substrate CD147 are degraded through a Herp-dependent pathway. (B) In EV71-infected cells, EV71 inhibits the ERAD pathway at multiple places: it downregulates the expression of Herp, Hrd1, VIMP, and UBXD8 and cleaves Ubc6e. The disabled ERAD causes tuning, and this is a strategy by which Herp can regulate ERAD [64, 89] . A previous study demonstrated that UBE2G2-gp78 is responsible for Herp degradation during the recovery from ER stress [63] . However, the mechanism by which Herp is degraded under physiological conditions is unknown. In the current study, Ubc6e was identified as the key E2 that participates in Herp degradation since silencing Ubc6e increased the intracellular levels of Herp (Fig 6A-6E) and silencing UBE2G2 had no effect (S9A Fig). We also tried to identify the E3 partner of Ubc6e that participates in Herp degradation. Although the candidate E3s included Hrd1, gp78, and RNF5, we unfortunately could not draw a definite conclusion because Herp was not upregulated when any of them were silenced (S9A- S9C Fig) . Nevertheless, we speculate that Hrd1 is involved in the degradation of Herp because overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of Hrd1 (C329S) increased Herp expression compared with WT Hrd1 (S9D Fig). However, it is unclear why silencing Hrd1 had little impact on Herp whereas overexpressing Hrd1 dramatically increased Herp levels. We postulate that Hrd1 and its association with Herp is a key determinant of intracellular Herp expression. Specifically, when Hrd1 is silenced Herp is downregulated, but when Hrd1 is overexpressed Herp is upregulated. Future studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and clarify the specific mechanism by which Herp is degraded.",

This study supports the role of p97 in the viral lifecycle and discloses the origin of the p97 that participates in the formation of ROs. However, it remains unclear how p97 functions in ROs.

However, EV71-induced ROs we observed under electron microscopy included both single-and double-membrane vesicles, and most were single-membrane vesicles. We also checked the distribution of EDEM1 in EV71-infected cells, and the results showed that it did not change during EV71 infection (S10 Fig) . Therefore, we conclude that EV71-induced ROs differ from EDEMosomes and that EV71 influences the cellular ERAD machinery via a totally novel and different mechanism.",

The current study found that EV71 inhibited cellular ERAD, a critical function through which the ER maintains homeostasis. Inhibiting ERAD inevitably causes ER deformation, which may lead to membrane different substrates to be tethered in the ER lumen. EV71 hijacks ER membranes to form single-or doublemembrane vesicles. p97 is hijacked from disabled ERAD to form ROs and co-localizes with EV71 2C, RTN3, and other replication-related molecules including PI4KB, ARF1, and GBF1.",
