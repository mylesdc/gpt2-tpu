High-throughput, inexpensive, sensitive sequencing methods and metagenomics now make it possible to study the contribution dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA virus-like particles make to the human virome, and in particular the intestinal virome. Aim: To review and evaluate the pioneering studies that have attempted to characterise the human virome and generated an increased interest in understanding how the intestinal virome might contribute to maintaining health, and the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. Methods: Relevant virome-related articles were selected for review following extensive language-and date-unrestricted, electronic searches of the literature. Results: The human intestinal virome is personalised and stable, and dominated by phages. It develops soon after birth in parallel with prokaryotic communities of the microbiota, becoming established during the first few years of life. By infecting specific populations of bacteria, phages can alter microbiota structure by killing host cells or altering their phenotype, enabling phages to contribute to maintaining intestinal homeostasis or microbial imbalance (dysbiosis), and the development of chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases including HIV infection and Crohn's disease, respectively.",

It is established soon after birth and is dominated by viruses that infect bacteria (ie, phages). The virome establishes a mutualistic relationship with eukaryotes/prokaryotes, contributing to intestinal homeostasis by influencing microbial ecology and host immunity. Composition of the virome is influenced by numerous factors that affect viruses directly (infection) or change host-cell populations (eg, antibiotics, diet). Members of the virome may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases via microbial host lysis leading to dysbiosis, infection of epithelial cells, and/or translocation of the compromised or damaged mucosal barrier to gain access to underlying tissues and immune cells, leading to immune activation. Dysbiosis can be defined as a microbial imbalance or any changes to the composition of resident microbial communities relative to the community found in healthy individuals. [101] [102] [103] Virome association with certain disease states is characterised by changes in diversity, and predominance of specific virotypes (eg, members of the order Caudovirales in IBD) (temperate) phages do not kill their host but instead integrate into their host's genome without interfering with its replication, incorporating the phage into its genome as a prophage that is transmitted to its progeny at each cell division. Lysogenic phages can be converted to a lytic cycle in response to environmental stressors (eg, antibiotics).",

The ability of phages to transfer genes from one prokaryotic host to another can lead to increased diversification of viral species, and increased antibiotic resistance and/or induction of toxins or virulence factors in prokaryotes. 5 Some phages alter the antigenicity of their hosts by producing enzymes that modify the O-antigen component of lipopolysaccharides. 6 Modification of surface structures of prokaryotes has the potential to affect microbial interactions with the human host, and influence niche specialisation within the GI tract. 7 Presence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) confers upon prokaryotes resistance to phage infection and contributes to prokaryotic adaptive immunity. Analyses of metagenomic sequence data provide detailed information on phage-host and phage-phage competition within the human faecal microbiome, implying CRISPR spacers are actively and continuously acquired by prokaryotes in response to the presence of phages in the GI tract. 8 The potential effects of such phage-host interactions on microbiota composition/function or host health are unknown.",

The main limitation of this method is the lack of available genome sequences from isolated phages, as \"driver sequences\" are required to provide baseline information upon which inferences can be made regarding sequence data and host phylogeny (only four such \"driver sequences\" were required in the Bacteroidales study). 21 Using co-occurrence profiling, crAssphage was identified in publicly available metagenomes, and by CRISPR analysis and co-occurrence profiling predicted to infect Bacteroides or Prevotella spp. 22 Assembly of sequence data from four deep-sequenced DNA viromes (8.1 Gb sequence data in total) from two healthy individuals led to recovery of 4301 contigs, representing 72 complete phage genomes plus potentially complete and partial phage genomes. 28 mapped to 160 contigs. A consortium of 155 phages contributed to the \"healthy gut phageome\" (HGP), though only 23 phages were present in >50% of samples (\"core\" phages, including crAssphage and nine other complete genomes), and 132 were present in 20%-50% of samples (\"common\" phages); 1679 were present in 2%-19% (\"low overlap\" phages). The HGP represented only 4% of the total phage community, with the expectation that the HGP will increase in size by analysing additional healthy individuals using deep sequencing. 28 Although it has been proposed the HGP may play a role in maintaining and possibly restoring a dysbiotic microbiota, 30 (Table S1 ). Later work on oral and faecal viromes of 20 individuals over a 6-month period confirmed this, demonstrating phages were persistent in these viromes and readily shared among related and unrelated members of the same household. 38 Sharing of phages encoding virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes has implications for shaping of microbiomes of those in close contact with one another, and warrants further study. With respect to antibiotic-resistance genes, their presence may have been over-estimated in human viromes 11, 20, 27, 31, 35, 37 as these entities are thought to be rarely encoded in phages. 39 Consequently, care should be taken when analysing data: proper in silico checks with conservative cut-offs are required to refine functional assignments and avoid over-interpretation of data. 39 and geminiviruses were detected in at least one twin of each pair between months 3 and 24 of the study. 46 Anelloviruses, associated with host immune status, were most prevalent from 3 months of age and highly divergent from known anelloviruses, with their abundance peaking at 6-12 months of age. The same anelloviruses were detected in faecal samples of the same infant collected 12 months apart, suggesting a persistent or stable source of recurring infection. 46 It was speculated the increase in anelloviruses between 6 46 The initially high phage population is unsustainable because of low numbers of bacteria colonising the GI tract.",

It has been estimated over half of humaninfecting viruses remain to be discovered. 76 Interactions with pets, insects and wild animals will also influence the composition of the human virome. From a pathogen perspective, bush-workers, abattoir workers and individuals exposed to insect bites have been highlighted as likely sources of new humaninfecting viruses. 75 With the advent of high-throughput, inexpensive, sensitive sequencing methods, it has become possible to study the contribution of dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA VLPs to the human virome. Gene transfer agents, which appear to represent defective phages, have not been examined in the context of the human microbiome or virome, but may also make a contribution to its genetic content. 77, 78 Similarly, exosomes-extracellular vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter consisting of proteins, lipids, miRNA, mRNA and DNA-derived from cells lining the GI epithelium are likely to contribute to nucleic acids found in viromes. 79, 80 Outer-membrane vesicles, the equivalent (in size and composition) of eukaryotic exosomes for Gram-negative bacteria, may",

Long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the presence of the genome in a faecal sample. The role of this phage in the human gut is unknown, and a representative of it remains to be isolated and purified. Novel human-associated viruses present in the gut virome can also be detected using viral metagenomics. Analyses of diarrhoea samples from Dutch patients with unexplained acute gastroenteritis led to the identification of novel members of the families Anelloviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Herpesviridae and Picornaviridae. 25 The role of these viruses in gastroenteritis is still to be established. It is also important to remember in exploratory (and other) studies that detecting virus nucleic acids in samples gives no indication of whether the viruses infect human or other cells. 26 6 | IND IVIDUAL INTE STINAL VIROMES ARE UNIQUE, BUT SOME PHAGES ARE SHARED AMONG INDIVIDUALS A longitudinal study (three time points over 1 year) of four pairs of adult monozygotic twins and their mothers demonstrated that, while the faecal prokaryote communities of related individuals are very similar, each individual harbours a unique faecal virome. 27 Intrapersonal diversity of the virome was low, with >95% of viruses retained over a 1-year period, with a few temperate phages dominating the viromes. This contrasts with Lotka-Volterra predator-prey relationships, in which cyclic changes in phage and prokaryote abundance would be expected, or with kill-the-winner dynamics, in which detectable changes in phage-host pairs would be detected. The majority (81%) of sequenced reads did not match any known viruses, and only 3.2 AE 2.8% reads could be assigned functions using KEGG. The predicted hosts of the identifiable phages were members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, in accordance with the predominant bacteria detected in the samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Although it is acknowledged overall individual faecal viromes are dissimilar, analyses of combined virome20,27 and total faecal metagenome data suggest the existence of a nontrivial common reservoir of phages shared among individuals in different geographical regions.8 Because of the small size of virus genomes compared with prokaryote genomes, it is relatively easy to achieve greater sequencing depth than total metagenome studies. Deep sequencing of faecal viromes (48 Gb of virome DNA across 12 individuals at three different time points over a 2-month period;~1.3 Gb of sequence per virome) allowed empirical assessment of hypervariation driven by a unique reverse-transcriptase (RT)-based mechanism in faecal viromes.31 Between 573 and 3390 contigs longer than 1 kb were assembled from the donors' viromes. The majority of predicted genes (72%) within these contigs encoded unknown proteins, but as with previous studies the majority of sequences were associated with DNA phages. Only one donor harboured a eukaryotic DNA virus-Human papilloma virus type 6b. This is typical of faecal viromes of healthy humans, in which recovery of DNA eukaryotic viruses is rare.19,20,27,32,33 \"Diversity-generating retroelements\" (DGRs), RT-based systems that introduce mutations at adenines in specific repeated sequences,33 were identified in the viromes of 11/ 12 subjects studied. Six predicted hypervariable genes encoded Ig-superfamily b-sandwich domains that have been associated with viral evasion of the immune system 31 and binding of phages to host mucin glycoproteins.34 Phage enrichment within the mucosa is thought to protect the host from bacterial infections by limiting the presence of mucosal bacteria (\"bacteriophage adherence to mucus\" model of protection), providing nonhost-derived immunity operating throughout the GI tract. 34 8 | EVOLUTION OF THE INTESTINAL VIROME , AND THE INFLUE NCE OF ANTIBIOTICS In-depth analysis of one healthy adult's faecal virome over 2.5 years (56 Gb of DNA sequenced over 24 samples taken at 16 time points) demonstrated its rapid evolution. 33 The majority (80%) of 478 assembled contigs persisted over the duration of the study, and accumulated sequence variation over time. The stability of phage nucleotide sequences was family-dependent. Temperate phages had the lowest substitution rate, whereas Microviridae had high substitution rates (>10 \u00c05 per nt per day), with identification of new viral species over the study period; numerous new viral species may emerge in the human gut over the course of a lifetime. Evolution of DGRs and CRISPRs in phage contigs was also observed. Therefore, multiple mechanisms contribute to phage sequence variation within the human faecal virome. Antibiotic therapy influences viromes, not by affecting VLPs directly but by affecting their prokaryote hosts. 35 For example, quinolones have been shown to induce Shigatoxin-encoding prophages by Escherichia coli in mice, leading to toxin production and death of animals. 36 In a longitudinal study involving four individuals on various broad-spectrum, long-term intravenous antibiotic therapies for Staphylococcus infections, oral viromes were affected more than faecal viromes by antibiotic treatment, with an increase in representation of papillomaviruses in the oral virome of antibiotic-treated patients. 35 A nonsignificant increase in antibioticresistance genes was seen in the faecal viromes of the patients. It was suggested sampling of individuals should be done at more regular intervals to get a true picture of the effect of antibiotics on viromes. It should also be noted the study was hampered by confounders relating to age of patients compared with controls and the patients being on different treatment regimes.

This overestimation of Microviridae abundance was due to preferential amplification of small circular genomes by the phi29 polymerase used to amplify the ssDNA. Corrected abundances suggested the Microviridae represent 3%-9% of known viruses in human faeces. Sequence analyses of a major capsid protein of the Microviridae and gut bacteria predicted Prevotella and Bacteroides to be the hosts of a number of these viruses, sharing high sequence similarity with prophage-like sequences encoded by these bacteria. Newer protocols for amplification and sequencing of ssDNA from environmental samples will improve characterisation of this group of viruses within the human gut.[40][41][42] 10 | RN A PHAGES IN FAECES OF H EALTHYADULTSThe GI tract of mammals is one of the natural habitats of RNA phages, with special relationships appearing to exist between specific RNA phage groups and their hosts.43 Coliphage RNA viral assemblages in the faeces of cows, foxes, elephants, pigs, horses, birds and humans and found group II and III RNA phages were predominant in human faeces, while group I and II RNA phages were predominant in the faeces of other animals. Of the 597 human faecal samples examined, 76.5% had fewer than 10 pfu/mL sample and 14.6% had between 10 and 100 pfu/mL sample (20%, w/v, faecal homogenates).Metagenomics was used to examine RNA viral assemblages in faecal samples obtained from two healthy adults: two samples were collected from one donor 6 months apart, with one sample obtained from the other donor.44 Three shotgun viral cDNA libraries were generated, with a total of 36,769 viral sequences obtained; 91.5% of these had significant similarity to sequences in the GenBank database, with three-quarters being most similar to viruses. Most(25,040/25,779 known) sequences were similar to plant-pathogenic RNA viruses. Forty-two viral species (2 animal, 35 plant, 1 yeast and 4 phage) were identified in the faecal RNA viral libraries, with Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), a well-characterised plant-pathogenic virus that infects all species of the genus Capsicum, being the most abundant. Using RT-PCR, PMMV was detected in food and faecal (large proportion of faecal RNA viruses come from exogenous sources. Support for this hypothesis came from the detection of PMMV in some processed pepper-containing foods. The amount of virus detected in faeces exceeded that detected in the ingested foodstuffs, suggesting plant RNA viruses replicate in the human GI tract; however, no data were presented to support this hypothesis. Faeces-derived PMMV could infect wax pepper plants, suggesting humans and other animals could act as transmission vectors for plant viruses through their digestive tracts. A second study 45 confirmed the presence of PMMV, and other plant RNA viruses, in human faeces. Studies into the ability of plant viruses to replicate in the human gut (in epithelial and microbial cells) should be initiated. 44,45 The low numbers of phage sequences retrieved (corresponding to Haemophilus influenza phage HP2, Roseophage SIO1, phage L cro and Shigella flexneri phage V 44 and enterobacteria phage phiK and phage phiV10 45 ) reflected earlier findings 43 in relation to the low numbers of RNA phages recovered from human faeces. 11 | ESTABLISHME NT OF TH E FAECAL VIR OME Microscopic examination of the meconium (ie, first faecal sample) of a newborn infant did not detect any VLPs. 32 By the end of the first week of life,~10 8 VLPs/g wet weight faeces could be detected, with this number seen as an underestimation of the true number due to high background fluorescence and clumping of the sample. A viral metagenome was generated from the faeces of the 1-week-old infant. Similar to adult DNA viral metagenomes, siphophage and prophage sequences predominated. Eight viral genotypes were predicted to be present in the infant's faecal virome, with the most abundant viral genotype contributing 43.6% to the total. The low diversity of the infant faecal virome correlated well with the known low diversity of the faecal bacterial assemblage in the first week of life. Sequences with significant similarity to podophages and myophages were also detected. More than 50% of the significant hits were to phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria (Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus), with hits to phages that infect Gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides and Listonella) also identified. Microarray analyses of viromes obtained from faecal samples at weeks 1 and 2 of life with probes constructed from the week 1 sequencing library showed the temporal nature of the infant gut virome, with >50% sequences that were at high abundance at week 1 absent at week 2, and the most abundant sequences at week 2 being of medium abundance at week 1. No sequences were present at high levels at week 1 Streptococcus pyogenes phage terminase (large subunit), a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron integrase and Bacillus thuringiensis phage MZTP02. A portion of the sequence amplified by the B. thetaiotaomicron integrase primer set was identical to a viral sequence retrieved in the first adult faecal virome study. 32 VLP DNA was isolated from the breast and formula milk fed to the infant, faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 5 and 14 weeks of age, and from the faeces (two samples taken a year apart) of an unrelated adult. All three VLP sequences were present in the first 3 months of the infant's life and did not originate from breast or formula milk. The B. thetaiotaomicron integrase was detected in all faecal (infant and adult) samples examined, while the other two VLP sequences were detected only in the infant faecal samples. It is possible the assay used in this study was not sensitive enough to detect VLP sequences in milk samples, as one would assume that populations would be in very low numbers in these substrates. This point seems especially relevant given >25% of the sequences identified in the faecal viral assemblage were most similar to those of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria known to be abundant in breast milk. It is not known from where the initial infant gut virome originates, although it has been suggested dietary, environmental and maternal sources may be sources of inocula. 32 In addition, primary infant faecal viruses may originate from induction of prophages from primary bacterial colonisers. 32 A more-extensive metagenomic study examining the infant (DNA and RNA) virome in four pairs of twins over the first 24 months of life (sampling at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months) identified eukaryotic DNA viruses from month 3 onwards (ssDNA-anelloviruses, ciroviruses, geminiviruses, nanoviruses, parvoviruses; dsDNAadenoviruses, polyomaviruses), but only anelloviruses, circoviruses",

The influence of malnutrition on development of the infant faecal virome was investigated during the first 30 months of life in eight pairs of healthy twins and 12 pairs of twins discordant for severe acute malnutrition (six pairs with one twin healthy, one with marasmus; six pairs with one twin healthy, one with kwashiorkor). 50 As with the study of Lim et al 46 Anelloviridae were prevalent in early life, but diminished at 15-18 months of age. In addition, Microviridae increased in abundance with age. Siphoviridae were the most abundant VLPs during 0-10 months, but then slowly decreased. This demonstrated that, as with the prokaryotic component of the faecal microbiota, age affects virome composition in early life. Discordant twins could be distinguished from healthy twins based on phage populations and the presence of higher levels of eukaryotic viruses of the families Anelloviridae and Circoviridae. 13 | THE INTESTINAL VIROME, IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND DISEASE Alterations in the intestinal virome characterised by reduced diversity and altered intestinal barrier function have been associated with infectious and autoimmune diseases in addition to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease (Figure 1). A potential pathogenic mechanism involves translocation of viruses present in the gut microbiota across the intestinal epithelial barrier, particularly in situations of altered and increased permeability that exert immunomodulatory effects on the host. 51HIV-1 and rotavirus are known to escape the gut and disseminate to peripheral tissues via components of the immune system.51 Enterocytes are able to recognise specific phage peptides and transport them across the mucosal barrier.51 HIV patients are affected by translocation, and have associated systemic inflammation. 52 Changes to the faecal virome and bacterial microbiome have been seen in HIV patients, with increased numbers of adenovirus-associated sequences and increased bacterial diversity and richness associated with peripheral CD4 T-cell counts of <200; phage populations are not detectably affected by HIV disease status or anti-retroviral therapies, 52 but plasma samples from HIV patients contain gut microbiota-derived nucleic acids. 53 Phages have been detected in blood samples of healthy humans, while mycobacteriophages have been found in the blood of patients with sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease (CD), and in healthy individuals.",

Newborns and children vaccinated with phage (/X147) formed antibodies against the phage within 1 week of exposure.55 Tumour-specific phages can be used to treat disease by initiating infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes in a toll-like-receptor (TLR)-dependent manner.56 Mono-association of germ-free mice with Murine norovirus (positive strand RNA virus) was sufficient to replicate the beneficial effects of commensal bacteria, restoring small-intestinal morphology and lymphocyte function without overt inflammation or disease.57 Presence of innate lymphoid cells was reduced in the virus-treated mice compared with controls. Inoculation of antibiotic-treated, wild-type mice with Murine norovirus for 10 days increased villi width, Paneth cell granules, intestinal T cells and IFN-the Murine norovirus-infected mice. Genes associated with development and function of haematopoietic cells were also affected. Inoculation of antibiotic-treated mice with Murine norovirus protected the mice from Citrobacter rodentium superinfection. The protective effects of the virome may explain recent findings with respect to treatment of patients with Clostridium difficile infections with sterile faecal filtrates: based on the published protocol, the faecal filtrates used in the study are likely to have contained phages in addition to the \"bacterial debris, proteins, antimicrobial compounds, metabolic products, and oligonucleotides/ DNA\" reported. 58 Support for a role for phages in the success of faecal microbial transplants (FMTs) to treat C. difficile infections comes from a pilot study by Zuo et al 59 : when donors had higher diversity (richness) of Caudovirales than recipients, FMT was successful; in instances where recipient virome richness was greater than that of the donor, over half of the recipients experienced disease recurrence after FMT. Large cohort studies that characterise donor and recipient viromes are required to validate these findings. 59 14 | THE INTESTINAL VIROME AND INFLAMMATOR Y BOWEL DISEASE The most compelling and direct evidence for enteric viruses playing a causal role in chronic GI inflammation, however, comes from studies in mice. 60 Mice with a mutation in the autophagy gene Atg16L1, which in humans predisposes to CD, develop normally and are symptom-free. However, enteric infection by norovirus resulted in the manifestation of the disease, although solely having the virus or the susceptible allele alone did not produce the disease, demonstrating the importance of virus-susceptibility gene interactions in disease progression. Using a dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced rodent model of colitis, importance of the gut virometo GI immune homeostasis was demonstrated.61 In mice administered a cocktail of anti-viral drugs followed by DSS, the animals treated with anti-virals had much more severe colitis than the animals with an intact virome, along with greater weight loss and reduction in colon length. Protective effects of the virome were mediated by stimulation of both TLR3 and TLR7, but not individually. Administration of inactivated rotavirus partially restored the virome-associated protective effect to the anti-viral-treated mice.",

Greater sequencing depth allowed assembly of contigs (7175 of at least 500 bp in length), with 87% of reads contributing to these.

Tailed phages predominated (Siphoviridae, 18% of the total; Myoviridae, 10%; Podoviridae, 4.8%; Microviridae, 0.9%; other families, 0.4%). The majority of contigs (55%) shared no significant amino acid homology with any phage family, while 11% had homology to multiple phage families. No eukaryotic viruses were detected. Minor convergence of viromes was seen when individuals were fed the same diet, though each individual retained a unique virome. Induction of lysogeny may have contributed to changes in phage abundance during the dietary intervention, though this has not been demonstrated empirically. In contrast to total faecal metagenomes, which were enriched in ACLAME prophage sequence, 41% were assigned to Firmicutes, 0.9% were assigned to Bacteroidetes, 16% were assigned to the Proteobacteria. 20 This pattern did not match abundance of bacteria within samples, leading to the suggestion prevalence of temperate phages in faeces may differ among different phyla with the caveat that conclusions were",

With the exception of the four viromes generated by Manrique et al 28 all viromes generated to date have relied upon PCR amplification or multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to generate sufficient DNA for sequencing.These methods introduce bias into sequencing libraries. For example, when using the WTA2 kit it is recommended to use the Nextera XT library preparation kit to avoid cluster-calling problems during Illumina sequencing. However, the Nextera kit causes under-representation of ends of viral genomes because of the way this kit works.66 CsCl centrifugation has been shown to be the most efficient method for removing host DNA, but it discriminates against some phages and is not reproducible; consequently, this method is not suitable for quantitative studies.67 16.2 | Phage isolationMethods of recovery of faecal phages have improved recently(Table 2), so it should be feasible to generate PCR-or MDA-free, deep-sequenced viromes to allow greater characterisation of the human gut virome. The question will then become how many sequence data are required to adequately characterise the virome.Current sequencing depths and paucity of available virus genome sequences (Figure 2) may mean phages that infect different bacterial hosts may be indistinguishable.20 Low sequencing depth also means low coverage of VLP genomes within samples, making it difficult to differentiate between spurious alignments and real virus sequences and potentially leading to overestimation of VLPs in samples when relying on automated read alignments.68 Bioinformatics tools are required that allow differentiation of authentic sequences from artefacts.",
