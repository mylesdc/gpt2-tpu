            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus that has received widespread attention because of its effect on the developing fetus. In utero infections cause congenital defects, most notably microcephaly along with other deformities (Schuler-Faccini et al. 2016) . While ZIKV infection of adults generally produces only a mild disease, it is becoming apparent that, as with other flavivirus infections, severe neurological sequelae can occur. Recent outbreaks have been associated with higher incidences of peripheral neuropathies such as Guillian-Barr\u00eb syndrome (GBS) Cao-Lormeau et al. 2016; Cardoso et al. 2015; Samarasekera and Triunfol 2016) and other neurological diseases such as myelitis (Anaya et al. 2017; Dirlikov et al. 2016; Mecharles et al. 2016) , encephalitis (Carteaux et al. 2016; Nicastri et al. 2016; Soares et al. 2016) , seizures (Asadi-Pooya 2016), and various ophthalmological conditions Smith et al. 2016 ). This is not surprising considering that related flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (Solomon et al. 1998) can cause myelitis and motor deficits (Sejvar et al. 2003) . Given the emerging nature of ZIKV, however, it is likely that we do not fully understand the acute and long-term consequences of ZIKV infection on the nervous system. Therefore, investigating the pathobiology of ZIKV in animal models will help to understand the potential for ZIKV to cause neurological disease in human subjects. We focus herein on adult models because ZIKV-related motor deficits have been primarily associated with adult infection, as opposed to in utero infection (Anaya et al. 2017; Dirlikov et al. 2016; Mecharles et al. 2016 ).",

            "text": "Prior to the 2015 ZIKV outbreak, a few animal models of ZIKV infection existed, but infection of rodents was largely non-productive unless a lab strain of the virus that had undergone several serial passages in mice was used (Dick 1952) . After the recent outbreaks, efforts to develop animal models with more clinically relevant isolates of the virus have been renewed. A rapid series of publications found that adult mice that lack type 1 (\u03b1\u03b2; A129 and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 strains) or types 1 and 2 (\u03b1\u03b2/\u03b3; AG129 strain) interferon receptors are susceptible to lethal infection (Aliota et al. 2016; Lazear et al. 2016; Manangeeswaran et al. 2016; Rossi et al. 2016; Zmurko et al. 2016) . These models may have some relevance to human ZIKV infections in that, like many viruses, ZIKV gains advantages in human hosts by inhibiting interferon responses (Best 2017; Bowen et al. 2017; Schulz and Mossman 2016) . Because viruses may not be able to inhibit mouse-specific interferon pathways (Aguirre et al. 2012) , blocking them by other means, as in AG129 mice, may more closely mimic what happens in humans. Although AG129 mice are deficient in innate immune responses, they do elicit acquired immune responses, such as vaccine-elicited protective immunity (Sumathy et al. 2017; Weger-Lucarelli et al. 2017) . While complete knockout of the interferon responses produces a more severe disease in mice, it can provide insights into what happens when ZIKV gains access to the adult central nervous system (CNS). Besides a lethal infection, these mice manifest neurological symptoms such as Btoe walking,^tremors, loss of balance, paralysis, and hunched posture (Aliota et al. 2016; Lazear et al. 2016; Manangeeswaran et al. 2016; Rossi et al. 2016) .",

After infection, one sham-infected mouse was recorded for every one to two ZIKV-infected mouse. Measurements were obtained by a researcher who was blind to the infection status and deficit score of each mouse. CMAP responses were recorded in response to stimulation at the sciatic notch and then the lumbosacral spinal cord.

Using a ChAT antibody to label ventral motor neurons, many were found to be ZIKV ir (arrows in Fig. 5  (B 1 -B 3 ) ) and a few ventral cells with clear neuronal morphology were strongly ZIKV ir, but only weakly ChAT ir (asterisks in Fig. 5 (B 1 -B 3 ) ). As many as 20-70% of ventral motor neurons were ZIKV ir (Fig. 5 (L) ), which suggests that ZIKV can infect and replicate in lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. The number of motor neurons at the L4-L5 and S levels was also diminished in many ZIKV-infected mice (Fig.  5 (N and O) ), but the difference from sham-infected mice did not reach statistical significance, likely because the disease progressed so rapidly.",

Statistically significant correlations were only found with spinal cord parameters. Increased numbers of ZIKV-infected ventral motor neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord are associated with higher VPS scores (Fig. 8a , p < 0.05), and higher VPS scores are associated with decreased survival of spinal motor neurons (Fig. 8c, p < 0.001) . These data suggest that ZIKV infection of lower motor neurons and lower motor death adversely affects hindlimb function. Interestingly, the level of neutrophil infiltration was inversely proportional to VPS score (Fig. 8f , p < 0.05), which suggests that the presence of neutrophils might mitigate motor deficits. To get a preliminary indication of how neutrophil invasion and spinal motor neuron viral infection are related to spinal motor neuron survival (as opposed to VPS score), correlation graphs with these parameters were prepared as well and similar trends were observed (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). VPS scores did not appear to correlate with virus levels in the motor cortex (Fig. 8g , h) or with sciatic nerve infection levels (data not shown).",

We reasoned that since motor deficits progress quickly after symptom onset and many motor neurons, though infected, have not died by the time severe deficits occur, axons and NMJs may still be healthy even if the neuronal cell body is sick. Thus, CMAP amplitudes may be normal in response to sciatic notch stimulation, but decreased upon lumbosacral spinal cord stimulation.

Figure 9a shows the CMAP amplitudes for each animal pre-infection and post-infection in response to stimulation at the two sites. There are no statistically significant differences between groups when these Babsolute^values are used. The use of relative values, however, are more compelling, and may be necessary because individual differences in the thickness and composition of tissue between the surface of the skin and the muscle can affect CMAP amplitudes (Nordander et al. 2003) . When post-infection CMAP amplitude was expressed relative to pre-infection amplitude (both in response to sciatic notch stimulation), there was no statistically significant difference between the ZIKV-infected and sham-infected groups (Fig. 9b , Bpre minus post, at notch^), suggesting that the axons and NMJs are healthy after infection and motor deficits are not due to myositis or neuritis. When post-infection CMAP amplitude in response to stimulation of the spinal cord was expressed relative to the amplitude in response to stimulation at the sciatic notch, however, there was a statistically significant relative decrease in amplitude in the ZIKV-infected group (Fig. 9b , Bpost, at s. cord minus notch,^p < 0.05). This suggests that, after infection and at the time motor deficits are observed, the axons and NMJs are healthy enough to generate a normal CMAP response when axons are stimulated at the sciatic notch, but the neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord are impaired and less able to generate normal CMAP responses when stimulated at the lumbosacral spinal cord. This indicates that myelitis, rather than myositis or neuritis, contributes to the motor deficits. The fact that VPS score did not correlate with the relative CMAP amplitude in response to spinal cord stimulation (Fig. 9c) , however, suggests that other factors also contribute to hindlimb motor deficits.",

CMAP amplitudes decreased in a dose-dependent manner over the course of the 1 h after \u03b1-btx injection, whereas CMAP amplitude in the saline-injected animal was relatively stable (Fig. 10) .

Motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or GBS-like syndrome. This is an important new finding because the most severe histopathologies previously reported in AG129 mice were in the brain and muscle (Aliota et al. 2016) . The finding that myelitis is likely the primary cause of ZIKV-induced paralysis is also in alignment with what has been seen with other flavivirus-induced motor deficits (Sejvar et al. 2003; Solomon et al. 1998 ). This conclusion is also supported by our data suggesting that muscle and peripheral nerve functions are normal. Electrophysiological CMAP amplitude measurements of sciatic nerve and sural muscles were normal in response to stimulation at the sciatic notch.",

The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Relative CMAP amplitudes upon stimulation at the lumbar spinal cord were also reduced when obvious motor deficits were present (VPS score \u2265 3). ZIKV infections in the brain and spinal cord were also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration.

Paralysis in these animals could be caused by motor cortex, cerebellum, or brainstem dysfunction, as extensive infection was observed in these areas of the brain. While upper motor neuron disease is associated with rigid, rather than flaccid paralysis, we occasionally saw symptoms that could be interpreted as rigidity, such as walking with high haunches and extended/stiff limbs, but it was difficult to reliably assess this with the VPS test. Another possible explanation for the paralysis in animals with normal relative CMAP amplitudes is that spinal motor neuron infection damages dendrites and post-synaptic densities such that the neurons are not able to receive signals physiologically, but when stimulated externally with an electrode, the axon hillock and axon are healthy enough to propagate an action potential to the muscle.",

Increased numbers of neutrophils, as detected by the Ly6G antibody, were inversely correlated with VPS score (p < 0.05). Studies with WNV demonstrate that neutrophils can play complex roles during infection. They appear to be protective early in WNV infection, but detrimental later. When neutrophils were depleted before WNV challenge in C3H/HeJ mice, mortality increased, but when they were depleted after WNV challenge, mortality decreased (Bai et al. 2010) . Another level of complexity regarding the role of neutrophils involves mosquito bites. When neutrophils are depleted and inflammasome activity is blocked, the ability of mosquito bites to promote infection and inflammation is abrogated (Pingen et al. 2016) . Therefore, the role of neutrophils in ZIKV-induced disease should be further investigated.",

It could mean that microglia and macrophages are present, but the iba1 marker is strongly downregulated, or it could mean that microglia are killed and macrophage infiltration is inhibited. After WNV infection in C57BL6 mice, microglia and macrophages are strongly activated (Zukor et al. 2017) . They are also strongly activated in wild-type C57BL6 or 129S1/SvImJ mice infected with ZIKV intracerebrally at E14.5 (Shao et al. 2016) . Thus, the decrease in iba1 ir after ZIKV infection in our study might be unique to the AG129 mouse strain and could indicate a role for microglia and macrophages in protecting against lethal ZIKV infection. For example, M1 macrophages elicit proinflammatory responses and enable phagocytosis and killing of pathogens, and M2 macrophages function in protective and homeostasis of the CNS (Kabba et al. 2018) . A certain balance of these functions could be overall protective. To further elucidate immunological cellular responses, decreased iba1 ir cells and modulation of other immune cells should be validated with flow cytometric analysis in future studies.",

As astrocytes regulate synapse formation, function, and elimination (Chung et al. 2015) and control glutamate excitotoxicity (Murphy-Royal et al. 2017) , this likely had a significant effect on motor neuron health and function. In a model of human coronavirus, expression of the primary glutamate transporter in the adult CNS, GLT-1, was decreased in astrocytes. This was associated with flaccid hindlimb paralysis even in the absence of significant neuronal death. Blockade of 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propranoic acid (AMPA) receptors with a non-competitive antagonist improved hindlimb function (Brison et al. 2011) . In mouse models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, astrocytes are implicated in the temporary stripping of excitatory synapses from motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to severe flaccid paralysis in the absence of neuronal cell death (Blakely et al. 2015; Marques et al. 2006 ). Astrogliosis may not have correlated with VPS scores in our studies because it may precede and be required for the onset of motor deficits (Blakely et al. 2015) .",

Extensive histopathology and infection occur in the spinal cord and brain, but not in the sciatic nerve or muscle. The severity of motor deficits is only correlated with infection and survival levels of lumbosacral spinal motor neurons. Moreover, gastrocnemius CMAP amplitudes upon electrical stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were impaired, but not upon stimulation of the sciatic nerve.
