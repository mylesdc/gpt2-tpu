These genetic factors interact with environmental factors (e.g., early-life stress, family structure, peer pressure, or the social environment; McKenzie et al. 2005) to influence an individual's vulnerability to alcohol problems (Prescott and Kendler 1999) . The genetic component has been modeled by breeding animal strains (predominantly rats and mice) with a high preference for alcohol (e.g., the alcohol preferring [P] and nonpreferring [NP] rats, high-alcoholdrinking [HAD] and low-alcoholdrinking [LAD] rats, the high-alcoholpreferring [HAP] mouse, and C57 black mice). The environment also has been modeled, for example, by separating young monkeys from their mothers, which reproduces early-life stress (Barr et al. 2004 ).",

This heterogeneity, and the complexi ty that it introduces, makes it difficult to thoroughly characterize the disorder (see Oscar-Berman 2000) .

Alcoholics lacking impulse control also tend to exhibit noveltyseeking, aggressive, and antisocial behaviors and are sometimes referred to as type II alcoholics (Cloninger et al. 1985) . When monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth for 6 months, they demonstrate behaviors such as infrequent social interactions, less competent social behaviors, and higher alcohol consumption rates compared with their mother-reared peers (Higley et al. 1996) . These behaviors generally are consistent with the type II alcoholic personality. In rodents, disinhibition has been quantified using the plus-maze test, which draws on the animals' aversion to open areas and their desire to explore novel environments. Mice adminis tered alcohol spend more time in open areas than mice not exposed (Durcan and Lister 1988) . Heightened explo ration of novel environments is evi dence of disinhibition.",

            "text": "The prefrontal cortex is funda mentally composed of functional modules of excitatory pyramidal projection neurons and inhibitory (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) interneu rons. The processing of information within these local circuits is critically dependent on GABA acting on GABA A receptors (Krimer and Goldman-Rakic 2001; Ticku and Mehta 1990); (figure 3). A feline model was the first to provide evidence that alcohol modifies GABA A receptor function. Using extracellular single-unit record ings in the precruciate cortex of anesthetized cats, it was found that alcohol (given at doses associated with human intoxication) rapidly and reversibly enhanced GABA A and its receptor activity, thus creating an overall inhibitory effect. This enhancement was specific to GABA, as the effect was not observed with glycine, dopamine, or serotonin (Nestoros 1980) . Human electrophysiology research also contributed to discerning the role GABA plays in response to alcohol exposure. The \u03b2 wave, typically observed in normal waking consciousness, describes brain activity greater than 12 Hz that arises from frontal brain regions and is generated by inhibitory interneurons (Whittington et al. 2000) . The \u03b2 wave is accentuated and rhythmic in the resting EEG of alcoholics and children of alcoholics (Porjesz and Rangaswamy 2007) . Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) researchers recently identified a significant linkage between the \u03b2 wave and a GABA A receptor gene in alcoholic individuals (Porjesz et al. 2002) . Taken together, these findings have led to the hypoth esis that subtle alterations in the structure or function of GABA A receptors may disrupt local cortical processing and information the cortex relays to other brain regions, thereby contributing to the deficits in executive function seen in alcoholism (Agrawal et al. 2006 ). More research is needed to determine whether altered GABA A receptors in the prefrontal cortex underlie the deficits in executive control of behavior observed in alcoholics. Nevertheless, the associations between a GABA A receptor variant, the \u03b2 wave, and disinhibited behavior in alco holics clearly demonstrates the unique relationship between the brain's struc ture and function, and animal models have been vital in helping to better understand this relationship.",

The decline was most marked and persistent in the cerebel lum (Friedman et al. 1984) , an area of the brain that is particularly vul-nerable to damage from excessive alcohol exposure. Indeed, post mortem studies support this finding, showing neuronal loss (Baker et al. 1999; Harper 1998; Phillips et al. 1987; Torvik and Torp 1986 ) and cellular dysmorphology (Andersen 2004; Victor et al. 1959) in the cere bellum of alcoholics. MRI also reveals significant volume deficits of the cerebellum of alcoholics that are espe cially profound in the anterior superi or vermis (Andersen 2004; Sullivan et al. 2000a ). These findings also are evident in animal models. Lower neuronal counts (Tavares and Paula-Barbosa 1982) and cellular dysmor phology (Dlugos and Pentney 1997; Pentney et al. 1989 ) have been observed in the cerebellum of the rat brain chronically exposed to alcohol. MRI of the P rat with moderate BALs of 125 mg/dl also demonstrat ed modifications in the cerebellum (Pfefferbaum et al. 2006a) .",

The organization of cerebellar inputs from the cortex via the pons (i.e., mossy fibers) is significantly different in humans than in rats (Paula-Barbosa and Sobrinho-Simoes 1976). Cerebellar activation of corti cal regions also has been shown to differ among the rat, cat, and monkey (Tolbert et al. 1978; Yamamoto et al. 2004 ). In addition, the GABA A receptor distribution in the cerebel lum has been found to be different between humans and rats (Kume and Albin 1994). The distribution of dopamine receptors in the cerebellum also differs between the mouse, rat, guinea pig, cat, and monkey (Camps et al. 1990 ). Finally, the pattern of cerebellar pathology in response to alcohol in rodents is markedly differ ent from that observed in humans (Tavares et al. 1987) . Such ubiquitous evidence for structural differences in the cerebellum among various species has implications for function and suggests that the study of fronto cerebellar circuitry disruption in alcoholism may be difficult in animal models.

Now, various results from animal studies have con verged to provide a potential mecha nism for alcohol-induced dopamine release. When \u00b5-opioid receptors in the VTA of wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats are activated, there is an increase in dopamine release (mea sured with in vivo microdialysis) in the nucleus accumbens (Spanagel et al. 1992 ). Indeed, \u00b5-opioid receptor acti vation hyperpolarizes (i.e., suppresses or inactivates) GABAergic interneu rons in the VTA, thereby releasing dopaminergic neurons from sponta neous inhibition (Johnson and North 1992) and facilitating dopamine release (Di Chiara and North 1992; Margolis et al. 2003) .",

This mechanism of action was fur ther substantiated by evidence that alcohol-stimulated dopamine release is decreased in mice in which the \u00b5-opioid receptor is genetically altered (or knocked out) (Job et al. 2007 ).

Indeed, any system involved in \"automatic\" or implicit learning (i.e., learning with out awareness) is fundamental for the establishment of habits (for reviews, Eichenbaum and Cohen 2001). Recent work in rodents has focused on the contribution of the corticostriatal net work to habit formation. This work suggests that a switch occurs in the control of instrumental behavior so that the associative or medial striatum, important in the early, goal-directed stage of action, is overridden by the sensorimotor or lateral striatum at the later, more habitual stage (reviewed by Yin, Part 2). Furthermore, several types of classical conditioning/implicit learn ing paradigms, including eye-blink conditioning (McGlinchy-Berroth et al. 1994) , visual discrimination learning (Rogers et al. 2000) , and contextual cue discrimination learning (Greene et al. 2007) , have been shown in both animal and human studies to be critical ly dependent on selective cerebellar sites.",

MRI provides in vivo evidence for volume deficits in the anterior hippocampus of chronic alcoholic individuals (Agartz et al. 1999; Sullivan et al. 1995) . However, other than its effect on volume shrinkage, alcohol does not appear to have an effect on the number of hippocampal neurons, per se, as shown in studies using postmortem human hippocampal tissue (Harding et al. 1997; Kril et al. 1997) . In contrast to the human con dition, chronic exposure to alcohol in rodents induces a decrease in neu ronal counts in CA1 to CA4 regions of the hippocampus in female Sprague-Dawley (Bengoechea and Gonzalo 1991) and male Long-Evans (Walker et al. 1980 ) rats and a decrease in the number of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA2 regions of the hip pocampus of mice (Pawlak et al. 2002) . Compared with humans, rodents have a disproportionately larger hippocam pal volume, which may account for the notable differences in neuronal loss observed between humans and rodents. Nonetheless, modified hippocampal anatomy may contribute to impaired trace eye-blink conditioning in rats exposed to a binge-like patterns of alco hol in the early postnatal period (Tran et al. 2007 ) and in nonamnesic alcoholic individuals (McGlinchey et al. 2005) .",

Injections of the CRF antagonist D phe-CRF 12-41 into the central nucleus of the amygdala, but not the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or nucleus accumbens shell (figure 6C) in alcohol-dependent animals, reduced alcohol self-administration (Funk et al. 2006) .

For example, early life stress in a species that exhibits low glucocorticoid receptor expression in infancy could be less harmful than early life stress in a species that exhibits high glucocorticoid receptor expres sion, because there are fewer receptors to mediate the effects of elevated cor tisol (Fuchs and Flugge 2002) .

Indeed, the majority of shrinkage with drink ing does not necessarily reflect \"neu ronal loss.\" Rather, the controlled longitudinal imaging studies demon strating volume reductions likely reflect nonneuronal loss and neuronal cell body and process shrinkage.
