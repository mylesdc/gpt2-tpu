Laboratory testing is required for the diagnosis and management of these diseases and many other communicable and non-communicable diseases endemic to the African region. For many years, there had been steady neglect of national health laboratories in Africa, leading to a lack of trust in laboratory results and empiric treatment of patients. Early improvement efforts employed a vertical approach, creating national HIV-and AIDS-specific laboratories. This approach has proved inadequate, as it created competition for resources and did not improve the entire laboratory system in the countries. 1 It became clear that all laboratories in a country should be part of a fully-integrated laboratory network that can address both individual patient care needs and public health needs from the peripheral levels to the national level.",

In 2008, a number of international meetings helped to focus efforts on an integrated network approach to laboratory system strengthening efforts. These included the Maputo Declaration in Mozambique 2 and the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) Resolution AFR/RC/58/R2, which was issued during the 58th session of the Regional Committee held in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, in September 2008. 3 The creation of the Stepwise Laboratory (Quality) Improvement Process Towards Accreditation System by WHO AFRO 4 and the Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation programme in 2009 were major steps toward quality improvement of laboratories in the region. 5 These actions led to the development of National Laboratory Strategic Plans and a National Laboratory Policy in numerous countries, including Botswana, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritius, Senegal and Tanzania. One focus of these countries has been the development of an integrated, tiered national public health laboratory network that can provide high-quality, accessible and efficient laboratory testing services for the entire population.",

It is a primary responsibility of the national health laboratory in the Ministry of Health to develop and maintain the national laboratory network in the country. In this article, we present practical recommendations based on 17 years of network development experience for the development of effective national laboratory networks. These recommendations and examples of current laboratory networks, are provided to facilitate laboratory network development in other states. The development of resilient, integrated laboratory networks will enhance each state's public health system and is critical to the development of a robust national laboratory response network to meet global health security threats.",

This laboratory network-based surveillance of meningitis epidemics has played a significant role in the timely outbreak response in meningitis-belt countries. 7 In response to the Maputo Declaration, a number of sub-regional networks dedicated to disease surveillance, prevention and response have been launched in Africa with the support of several international development partners. One partner, the West African Laboratory Network, funded by the French Development Agency and Foundation M\u00e9rieux in 2009, focuses on three main areas of activity: training laboratory personnel, setting quality assurance, and strengthening epidemiological surveillance in seven West African francophone countries, including Guinea, since 2013. The West African Laboratory Network allowed for the first diagnosis of Ebola virus disease by the Jean Merieux P4 Laboratory in Lyon. 8 Another partner, the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Network Project, includes three mutuallyreinforcing components which are supporting the five East Africa Community member states to diagnose communicable diseases of public health importance and to share information about those diseases to mount an effective regional response. 9 In addition, effective national laboratory networks have been developed in a number of countries, including Ethiopia and Tanzania, as a result of the Maputo Declaration 2 and Resolution AFR/RC58/R2. 3 Despite the above exemplary achievements in developing laboratory networks, the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa highlighted gaps and unmet needs in these countries and underscored the importance of redoubling disease prevention and control efforts in Africa. While many countries have made progress in strengthening diagnostic and surveillance capacity, much more needs to be done, particularly to comply with the 2005 WHO International Health Regulations. 10 Consequently, there is a great need for a gap analysis assessment of current laboratory systems in Africa to promote innovative approaches to achieving sustainable national laboratory networks throughout Africa. To this end, a laboratory network assessment tool, the LABNET scorecard, was developed by the African Society for Laboratory Medicine to assist countries in assessing the development of their networks. 11",

It is led by a Global Health Security steering group of 10 member nations. The goal of the agenda is to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from global health threats posed by infectious diseases. Diseases of recent global threat concern include Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, yellow fever, and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. In May 2014, a Global Health Security Commitment Development meeting was held in Helsinki and identified 11 Global Health Security Action Packages, five of which have a laboratory component, 12 including Antimicrobial Resistance, Zoonotic Disease, Biosafety and Biosecurity, Immunization, and National Laboratory System. The goal of the National Laboratory System package is the development of safe and secure laboratory capacity in each country. It contains an action item to evaluate and improve capacity at national reference, provincial and district laboratories for 10 core laboratory tests. The core tests include bacterial culture for Salmonella enteritidis serotype typhi, viral culture for poliovirus, PCR for influenza virus, serology for HIV, microscopy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rapid diagnostic testing for Plasmodium spp., as well as at least four tests selected by the country on the basis of its major public health concerns. The five-year target is real-time biosurveillance with a national laboratory system and effective modern pointof-care and laboratory-based diagnostics. It is expected that the laboratory system will be able to reliably conduct testing on at least five of the 10 core tests on specimens transported to accredited laboratories from at least 80% of the districts in the country. 12 In addition, laboratories must develop plans for detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and surveillance of zoonotic diseases.",

Accurate laboratory data are essential for clinicians to accurately assess the status of patients' health, make accurate diagnoses, formulate treatment plans, and subsequently monitor the effects of treatment. This applies to both communicable and non-communicable diseases. A tiered, integrated laboratory network with strong supporting core capabilities will provide the best model for efficient service delivery across various levels of the public health system. 13 Traditionally, the public health laboratory has been the sole response laboratory for public health emergencies; however, a new model has emerged, 14 exemplified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Laboratory Response Network, a national network of laboratories charged with identifying and characterising agents of bioterrorism and other threats to public health. In this new model, the national public health laboratory leads a network of clinical and other agency laboratories, such as food testing, veterinary, and local public health laboratories, to support public health response.",

Activities must be prioritised as certain activities are required in order for others to take place. For example, a commodities list cannot be developed until the equipment plan for the network is finalised. An implementation plan must be developed with action plans for activities that are required to accomplish key strategies. Estimated costing information is required for all activities in the implementation plan for the first three years, at a minimum. Adequate funding of the plan is essential for its success. Ideally, an implementation team would be led by assigned laboratory leadership and a technical working group in consultation with implementation consultants. Implementation of the plan is the most critical and challenging aspect of the strategic planning process. Top laboratory leadership will need to own the implementation plan and monitor progress regularly. Plan implementation requires a separate monitoring and evaluation plan to determine whether planned targets are being met; Strategic Plans must be reviewed at least annually for progress made toward objectives.

The number of tiers in the laboratory system and the test menu performed at each level may vary depending on service level needs, priority diseases, geographic coverage, referral capabilities, and resources available. It may be desirable to first prioritise the full development of the national public health laboratory (Tier 4) and a good referral system, as the national reference laboratory could initially serve the testing needs for the country while the rest of the network is being developed.

Quality control procedures should be standardised based on equipment and methods in use. Quality control materials must be of high quality and available continuously. Since these materials may have a short shelf life, special procurement methods must exist to assure continuous availability.

Laboratories must participate in external quality assessment programs for critical assays in microbiology, haematology, immunology, microscopy and chemistry, in order to demonstrate that the laboratory has an acceptable level of quality. Definitions of acceptable performance in external quality assessment programmes should be defined and reports available to all laboratories. Laboratories must evaluate external quality assessment results and take appropriate corrective actions. The source of external quality assessment programmes (national or international) for each test should be defined in the plan. In order to reach all statewide laboratories, a national external quality assessment programme can be run by national health or reference laboratories (e.g., Burkina Faso). 22 National health or reference laboratories should participate in an international external quality assessment programme. 5.

National laboratory network laboratories should be able to conduct testing to support integrated disease surveillance for at least 10 priority infectious diseases, as described earlier. This requires an integrated, tiered laboratory network with modern diagnostic capabilities and real-time surveillance capabilities. Data from laboratory test systems should be available electronically in real-time to all stakeholders in the public health sector through interconnected information systems or databases. Laboratory-based surveillance must be fully implemented with a national reporting system for antimicrobial resistance. One reference laboratory in the country must be able to identify three of the seven WHO priority antimicrobial resistance pathogens. Ideally, laboratories at regional and national levels should be able to identify pathogens and perform antibiotic susceptibility testing. A surveillance system should also be in place for the detection of three to five priority zoonotic diseases. In order to accomplish this, multi-sector collaboration must exist between the laboratory network and the agriculture sector.",
