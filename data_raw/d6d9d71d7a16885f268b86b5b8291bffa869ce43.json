Essential oils (EOs), because of their volatility, can easily reach both the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the antibacterial evaluation of clove, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, scots pine, peppermint, and citronella EOs against respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the antibacterial effect of these EOs in two different test systems to provide data for the development of an appropriate product formulation. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined with in vitro vapor phase test (VPT) and broth macrodilution test (BDT). The chemical and percentage compositions of the EOs were determined by GC-MS and GC-FID analysis.",

Each EO sample was diluted with absolute ethanol (stock solutions: 0.5-195 \u03bcL/mL). 500 \u03bcL of stock solution was distributed on the surface of a sterile filter paper disc (thickness 0.18 mm, diameter 84 mm, Albet-Hahnem\u00fchle, Germany). The disc was placed on the separating wall of the PD after solvent evaporation. Therefore, there was approximately 2 mm distance between the disc and the inoculated agar surface. PDs were hermetically closed with Parafilm adhesive tape (Sigma Aldrich Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) to avoid the evaporation, and they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. After incubation, filter papers were removed and MIC values were determined. The MIC is the lowest concentration of an EO (expressed as \u03bcL of EO/free atmosphere above the growing microorganism) which can absolutely inhibit the visible growth of the bacteria. Filter paper discs containing absolute ethanol or left untreated were used as solvent and growth controls. All tests were carried out in triplicate.",

Peppermint presented inhibition against Streptococcus spp. in higher concentrations with MIC values in the range of 0.35-0.70 mg/mL. In the case of Haemophilus spp., cinnamon bark was the most effective (MIC: 0.06 mg/mL) oil, which was followed by thyme, peppermint, and clove. We observed that H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae were similarly sensitive to these EOs, besides, H. parainfluenzae showed an increased sensitivity to citronella, scots pine, and eucalyptus oil. In lower amount (MIC: 0.34 mg/mL), scots pine also showed activity against M. catarrhalis. In general, it has been observed that eucalyptus showed activity only in higher concentrations (MIC: 0.7-2.82 mg/mL). Scots pine oil was active mostly in the case of our Gram-negative strains. In comparison with antibiotics, EOs produced inhibition only in higher concentrations. We must note that the effect of detergents did not influence our results.",

As a result, MIC values were calculated and summarized in Table 5 . They were determined considering the amount of EOs and the free airspace (L) in the Petri dish. As control, absolute ethanol did not show any antibacterial effect. Among the EOs, cinnamon bark was the most effective against all investigated pathogens with MIC values in the range of 15.62-90 \u03bcL/L. Above 90 \u03bcL/L, thyme oil effectively inhibited the bacterial growth of Gram-positive pathogens. Besides, thyme volatiles also showed potent inhibition against Haemophilus spp. and M. catarrhalis. In the case of peppermint and citronella oils, moderate activities were detected against Gram-negative strains (MIC: 31.25-75 \u03bcL/L), moreover, their effectiveness against Streptococcus species was also observed in higher amounts. In our test system, clove oil was active only above 90 \u03bcL/L. EO of scots pine did not show any inhibition in VP, except in the case of H. influenzae. Therefore, we presume that scots pine has bacteriostatic effect, and its MIC is probably higher than 1500 \u03bcL/L. In contrast, vapor of eucalyptus oil effectively inhibited the growth of Haemophilus spp. and M. catarrhalis in higher concentrations (MIC: 125-225 \u03bcL/L). In the case of M. catarrhalis, we found citronella and cinnamon bark oils equally active, which was followed by peppermint, thyme, and clove. Among our tested pathogens, S. mutans was the least sensitive to EO volatiles, in lower concentration only cinnamon bark performed potent inhibition (MIC: 90 \u03bcL/L) against this pathogen. In conclusion, we should highlight that Gram-negative strains were more sensitive to EO vapors: we detected higher MIC values against all Gram-positive bacteria.",

            "text": "Due to the hydrophobic character of EOs, classical microbiological tests are not relevant for detection of the antibacterial activity of these substances, thus, some modifications and development of new techniques is essential for this purpose. With BDT, we could detect the antibacterial effect of EOs in liquid medium; however, the inhibitory effect of volatiles could be determined with VPT [10] . The EOs application via inhalation is becoming more frequent nowadays, especially in the case of bacterial infections of the respiratory [7] . Classical antibacterial assays did not model the circumstances of inhalation; moreover, they usually focus on the activity of EOs via direct contact. In opposite, VPT detect the effect of gaseous phase produced by EO vapor and they can be easily combined with other techniques [8] . It should be highlighted that VPT can also be adapted to other different pathogens such as fungi and viruses [15] [16] [17] [18] . According to the result of the microbiological assays, cinnamon bark, clove, thyme, peppermint, and citronella oils showed the most potent activity in both vapor and liquid systems. Therefore, they could be promising alternatives to support the current general treatment of bacterial infections. Their multicomponent composition gives them benefit in bacterial resistance; however, it simultaneously creates difficulties in their standardization and their effects' proper comparison [19] . In liquid form, cinnamon bark was the most effective against S. pneumoniae, while thyme oil showed the best activity against S. mutans. In the case of S. pyogenes, clove oil produced the lowest MIC value, which was followed by citronella. Cinnamon bark and thyme were equally active against this pathogen, which was in accordance with previous results [5] . Interestingly, Mulyaningsih et al. reported inhibition of S. pyogenes by eucalyptus fruit oil in lower amount compared to our MIC values. Because we used EO distilled from the leaves, we suggest that the difference is probably caused by the compositions of the eucalyptus oils in the experiments [20] . Parallel to our results, a previous publication has reported the same inhibitory trend and cited strong antibacterial character of cinnamon bark and cinnamaldehyde against S. mutans [21] . Against this pathogen, antibiofilm activity of eucalyptus oil was also published [22] . Between Haemophilus spp., slight differences were observed between the EOs. Among our test materials, we detected the best inhibition in the case of cinnamon bark followed by thyme and clove, which was in accordance with previous observations [23, 24] . H. parainfluenzae was more susceptible to citronella, eucalyptus, and scots pine. However, eucalyptus oil and its vapor was previously reported as promising solutions against respiratory viruses (e.g. Influenza Virus type A and mumps virus), their antibacterial value in several studies were less potent than the antiviral effect [16, 25] . According to other reports, which support our findings, eucalyptus oil could be a more potent inhibitor of Haemophilus species in contrast with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes in liquid phase [5, 25] . M. catarrhalis was completely inhibited by thyme in low concentration; as well as cinnamon and citronella showed similar activity against this pathogen. The same potency was observed previously by Dorman et al. and Tanaka et al., in addition, EO components such as cinnamaldehyde, citronellal, thymol, eugenol, geraniol, limonene; cis/trans citral and \u03b1-terpineole also produced activity in their test systems [24, 26] .",

Against all Streptococcus species, cinnamon bark vapor produced the lowest MIC value in the range of 75-90 \u03bcL/L. In the case of S. pneumoniae, the same inhibitory effect was observed than in BDT; however, we found scots pine vapor less active in gaseous phase. S. pyogenes was equally sensitive to citronella and thyme vapor, which was followed by clove and peppermint. Cinnamon bark volatiles were equally active against H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae; however, slight differences were observed between these two bacteria considering the activity of thyme, citronella, and peppermint. Our observations were in accordance with previous reports [9] . Against the above mentioned Gram-negative bacteria, clove and eucalyptus oil performed inhibition only in relatively high concentrations (MIC: 90-200 \u03bcL/L). Houdkova et al. reported moderate activity of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol against H. influenzae; surprisingly, they did not report any differences between the activity of vapor and liquid form of these components [27] . M. catarrhalis was equally sensitive to the vapor of citronella and cinnamon bark; in contrast, clove and eucalyptus produced inhibition only in higher concentrations against this pathogen. Except in the case of H. influenzae, scots pine vapor did not manage proper inhibition below 1500 \u03bcL/L. Table 6 summarizes the most potent EOs in liquid and vapor phase with MIC values below 0.5 mg/mL or 100 \u03bcL/L. In conclusion, we must highlight cinnamon bark as the most active EO in both in vitro systems. Besides, thyme, citronella, and peppermint oil and vapor also had strong antibacterial effect. At lower concentrations, clove oil was a more potent inhibitor in liquid phase; in vapor form it showed activity against H. influenzae only. Unfortunately, eucalyptus oil and its vapor were only active in higher concentrations.",

Interestingly, we found that Gam-negative pathogens required less EO for their total inhibition in our both systems. We suggest that this is partly due to the fact that S. mutans forms biofilm, which enhance the resistance of this pathogen. Our observation was in correlation with the results of Inouye et al. [9] . The reason for this phenomenon is not fully understood; however, the authors pointed out that the outer membrane of H. influenzae may have an important function [9] . However, it should be taken into consideration that due to their lipophilic character they require effective formulation to achieve the proper activity in the respiratory tract. Thus, further development of effective and economical application of EOs' special devices is indispensable in the future. [31] [32] [33] .",

Based on our results, we suggest that VPT provides the best detection for the activity of EOs based on gaseous contact. However, BDT is one of the most suitable direct-contact assays. On one hand, only the optimized BDT and VPT are able to provide trustworthy results about the antimicrobial effect of EOs. On the other hand, the evaluation of antibacterial activity it should be taken into consideration that EOs have different characters in liquid form or in VP which results in diverse biological activity. We conclude that cinnamon bark oil possess the strongest antibacterial activity against all the respiratory tract pathogens used in our study. On the whole, it should be highlighted that cinnamon, thyme, peppermint, and citronella also showed potent antimicrobial activity in vapor and in liquid form; in contrast, clove oil was more potent inhibitor in liquid phase. Finally, in vitro and clinical studies are also required to calculate the effective doses of EOs, determine the interactions between the components and reveal their toxicity.",
