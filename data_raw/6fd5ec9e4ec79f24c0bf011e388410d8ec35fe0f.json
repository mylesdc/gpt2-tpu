However, the likelihood to respond to treatment decreases with increasing severity of the disease. Patients with grade II aGVHD at diagnosis are significantly more likely to achieve a CR to initial treatment with high dose steroids as compared to patients with more advanced aGVHD [4, 5] . The prognosis of patients with aGVHD who fail to respond to high dose steroids is poor [2] . Currently there is no standard second-line treatment for steroid-refractory aGVHD (SR-aGVHD). Numerous strategies to treat SR-aGVHD have been reported, but results have been disappointing with varying response rates and long term overall survival (OS) of only 20-30% [2] .",

Etanercept is a recombinant human tumor necrosis receptor fusion protein which binds TNF\u03b1 with high affinity and as a consequence inhibits the biological activity of TNF\u03b1. Studies that have investigated the use of anti-TNF\u03b1 as primary as well as secondary treatment in aGVHD have shown promising response rates. First-line combination with methylprednisolone yielded a CR rate of 69% [7] and second-line treatment resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% [8] . Second-line therapy combining etanercept with daclizumab showed an ORR of 67% [9] . Treatment with multi-agent combination therapy including etanercept has been reported to induce responses in 81% of patients [10] .

All other patients either received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with cyclophosphamide (1 x 60 mg/kg), fludarabin (4 x 40 mg/m2) and TBI (2 x 2 Gy) or a non-myeloablative conditioning (NMA) with fludarabin (3 x 30 mg/m2) and TBI (1 x 2 Gy). Eleven patients received peripheral blood stem cells either from HLA identical sibling donors (n = 3) or from HLA matched unrelated donors (n = 8). Four patients received cord blood (CB) derived stem cells. One patient developed late-onset aGVHD after discontinuation of immunosuppressants, at day 393 post-transplant. All other patients were on GVHD prophylaxis at the onset of aGVHD. Acute GVHD developed at a median of 61 days after transplantation (range 23-393 days). All patients had grade III GVHD of the gut, the majority had involvement of a second organ. First-line treatment consisted of CsA and prednisolone 2/mg/kg/day in fourteen patients; one patient was treated with high dose steroids combined with MMF, because impaired renal function prohibited the use of calcineurin inhibitors.",

Our results compare well to a recent prospective study published by Van Groningen et al. concerning 21 patients with SR-aGVHD treated with a combination of etanercept and inolimomab, an IL-2 receptor antibody [13] . This cohort was strikingly similar to ours with respect to age, aGvHD severity and proportion of patients with gut involvement. Despite an ORR of 48%, OS was only 10% at a median of 55 days, due to progressive GVHD, serious infections and relapse of underlying disease. The pattern of a promising initial response in about 50% of patients, followed by non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients due to either progressive GVHD or the occurrence of serious infections, in particular, compares well to our findings. Wolff et al. prospectively studied the use of etanercept (16mg/m 2 ) in combination with dacluzimab (1mg/kg), an IL-2 receptor antibody, in 21 patients with SR-aGVHD (9). This cohort was younger with a median age of 44 years, and included fewer patients with high-stage involvement of the gut.

In the third CR patient etanercept had to be discontinued, because of EBVreactivation and development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).
