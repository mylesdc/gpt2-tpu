Two types of Canine adenovirus (CAVs), Canine Adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), the virus which causes infectious canine hepatitis, and Canine Adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), which causes canine infectious laryngotracheitis, have been found in dogs [5] . CAVs belong to the genus Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae. Virus enters the host via direct contact with contaminated saliva, urine, and faeces [6] . The incubation period is 4-7 days. CAV-1 replicates in vascular endothelial cells and causes a generalized infection characterized by hepatitis [7] , whereas CAV-2 has an affinity for respiratory tract epithelium and is mainly associated with outbreaks of respiratory disease in kenneled dogs [8] . CAV-1 causes fever, often above 40 \u2218 C, apathy, anorexia, abdominal pain, blood in faeces, acute/chronic hepatitis and interstitial nephritis, tenderness, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Dogs may develop bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, photophobia, and a transient corneal opacity, \"blue eye\", which may occur after clinical recovery as result of anterior uveitis and oedema [9, 10] . CAV-2 is characterized by respiratory disorders, with clinical signs that include tonsillitis, pharyngitis, tracheitis, and bronchitis [11] [12] [13] . Confirmation of diagnosis and identification of CAV-1 and CAV-2 infections are usually based on virus isolation, electron-microscopic observation and serological tests [14] . There are distinct differences in structure, antigenicity, and pathogenicity between the two CAVs. Serological tests such 2",

The ELISA was found to be a highly efficient and rapid test to determine the immune status of dogs to infectious canine hepatitis virus and canine adenovirus type 2 [15] . The ELISA is a sensitive, reliable and fast method for the detection of anti-adenovirus antibody [16] . When compared with SN test, the ELISA has several advantages. It does not require cell culture, the risk of contamination is less and the optimization is easier than other serological test methods. With the advent of molecular techniques, restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of the viral genome has been said to differentiate between the two viruses [11, 14, 17] .",

This appearance, which is generally observed in the convalescence period, disappears spontaneously. In some cases of mild infection, no clinical symptom is observed other than corneal edema. Although, rarely, this clinical picture may also develop as a vaccination complication, this option was discarded as the 2 animals that presented with corneal edema were unvaccinated. This clinical picture, specifically referred to as \"Hepatitis Blue Eye\" is known to be caused by CAV-1. However, as early detection was not possible, the CAV antibodies were not able to be typed in the animals that presented with leukopenia and lymphopenia.",

Accordingly, it was determined that antibody prevalence was higher in females (41%) in comparison with males (36%). Due to the number of female animals sampled in this study being greater than the number of sampled males, it is considered that the difference observed in antibody prevalence for sex is not significant ( > 0.05). On the other hand, in previously conducted studies, the correlation of sex with antibody prevalence was neither not investigated nor found to be statistically insignificant. Therefore, a comparative assessment was not able to be made in this study.",

In view of the animals that had been admitted to the internal medicine clinic of Selcuk University being vaccinated dogs, the antibody presence confirmed in these animals was considered as an indicator of the vaccination schedule having been properly applied in these animals. On the other hand, the antibody prevalence detected in the unvaccinated animals sampled at the dog shelters in Isparta and Burdur provinces was considered as an indicator of the presence of CAV infection in these dog shelters. This study clearly demonstrates the high prevalence of CAV infection in dogs, which live in groups and are not vaccinated on a regular basis. It is considered that regular vaccination would provide protection against the disease for a certain time period in dogs, and in particular in puppies, which live in groups under unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, as the transmission of the CAV occurs by environmental contamination (contact with infected faeces, urine, etc.), both the maintenance of hygiene conditions and the prevention of contact among dogs are of great importance in the control of the disease.",
