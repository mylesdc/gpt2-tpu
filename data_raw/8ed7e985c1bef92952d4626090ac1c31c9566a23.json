All informants cited hot/cold weather changes or using cold water as causes for catching cold. They associated transmission of respiratory infections with close contact with a sick person's breath, cough droplets, or spit; sharing a sick person's utensils and food. Informants suggested that avoiding such contact was the most effective method to prevent respiratory infection. Although informants perceived that handwashing after coughing or sneezing might prevent illness, they felt this was not typically feasible or practical.",

Acute respiratory infection is a major cause of child mortality in Bangladesh, accounting for 21% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years from 2000 to 2004 [7] . When pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred in Bangladesh in 2009, there was concern for its potential to rapidly spread due to the high population density and lack of respiratory hygiene. To contain or reduce transmission of viruses such as pandemic influenza the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions and public health messages on maintenance of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette [8] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified certain respiratory hygiene measures, including: covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing; using tissues to contain respiratory secretions; disposal of used tissues in the nearest waste receptacle; and washing hands with soap after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects. CDC recommended that if persons do not have a tissue, they should cough or sneeze into their upper sleeve, not into their hands, to stop the spread of germs [1, 6] . Nevertheless, a recently conducted quantitative study in a rural and an urban site in Bangladesh found that very few people in these areas currently practice respiratory hygiene. Of the 1,122 observed coughing and sneezing events, 907 (81%) people coughed or sneezed into the air, 119 (11%) into their hands and 83 (7%) into their clothing [9] .",

Finding ways to communicate health messages that could prevent respiratory infections is difficult for several reasons: respiratory diseases tend to have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, e. g. coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing; symptoms of respiratory infections exist on a continuum from mild to severe; people perceive respiratory illnesses as \"mild\" events even among those who have severe signs and symptoms; some symptoms are related to non-infectious illnesses such as asthma or allergies; some respiratory viruses are spread through the air and thus not easily traced [10] [11] [12] [13] . The inability to recognize the severity or understand transmission patterns of respiratory illness is a concern because when viral respiratory infections occurs within a community people may not respond or may take ineffective actions to reduce personto-person spread of the viruses. For example, they might try to avoid being exposed to cold weather or water rather than avoiding persons with respiratory symptoms. Improved respiratory hygiene, such as coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve, could reduce the risk of respiratory illness, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh, because both crowding and poor ventilation facilitate respiratory infections spread quickly from person to person [3] . In low-income countries like Bangladesh, disposable tissues are considered a luxury and not commonly used.",

During in-depth interviews, lasting from 35 min to 60 min, and focus group discussions, ranging from 55 min to 90 min, we used an interview guide that started by asking people to list all of the illnesses they could think of that they associated with respiratory functions. We also asked about their perceptions on causes of respiratory illness, how respiratory infections are passed from one person to another, how disease transmission can be prevented, existing social norms, current practices related to respiratory hygiene, and for suggestions of messages and channels to promote respiratory hygiene behavior. We also conducted unstructured observations in markets to see respiratory hygiene practices in public places. During observation, we took notes about customers' and shopkeepers' behaviors linked to respiratory hygiene (Appendix 3). Nevertheless we did not count the events as we conducted unstructured observations in extremely crowded market places. Rather than quantify, we were more interested in observing people's actual respiratory hygiene practices including: whether people covered their mouths during coughing or sneezing; if so, how they covered their mouths (with hands/upper arm/ cloth); whether they turned away from others while coughing or sneezing; whether they spat on the ground; and whether they washed their hands after nasal cleaning or coughing or sneezing into hands.",

Our findings related to catching cold are similar to other anthropological and qualitative studies conducted on childhood acute respiratory infection during the 1990s. These studies suggested that people related the occurrence of acute respiratory infection to imbalances of hot and cold in the body, rather than to an infectious agent that can be transmitted from person to person [10, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Nevertheless, the sites were typical of Bangladeshi communities, and we enrolled a heterogeneous mixture of informants from a variety of social groups. As our groups of informants had similar perceptions related to prevention and transmission, our findings from this formative study provide a foundation to design communication materials promoting respiratory hygiene practices that might be applicable for both rural and urban settings. Although we could not recruit informants from all geographic areas in the study sites for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adult males and females, we systematically selected participants from every 10th household in order to select them to diminish the bias of sample selection. Focus group discussions were limited in scope to fully explore complex beliefs. Nevertheless, we also conducted numbers of in-depth interviews, which were more appropriate to explore community beliefs. In focus group discussions, some participants were not vocal, and while the group facilitator tried to encourage them, this may have led to bias. Nonetheless, we triangulated our findings from indepth interviews, focus group discussions and observations.",

Health professionals could use local terms to explain transmission of respiratory infections from the bio-medical perspective to highlight how changes in behavior could prevent transmission. These messages could make people more conscious about respiratory hygiene and then motivate them to follow their identified 'good behaviors' on a regular basis. Since the informants indicated that it is not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing and sneezing, our communication message could be to ask people to cough and sneeze into their upper arm or sleeve. We suggest piloting these messages with a variety of communication approaches and channels with all community members to reduce respiratory infections. 4 . Please tell us something about the present norms, cultures and practices related to respiratory hygiene/diseases of your society. 5 . In your community, what are the current practices when people sneeze or cough?",

Did you catch cold during the last 3/6/12 months? How do you think you were infected?3. How is respiratory infection passed on from one person to another? 4. How can respiratory disease transmission be prevented?5. Please tell me about the existing social norms of respiratory hygiene in your community? Which norms are common? Which norms do you think are important? (probe for the perception of the respondent about the rationale for these norms) 6 . In your community, what are the current practices when people sneeze or cough? 7. Do you think there is any relationship between handwashing and respiratory diseases? Why or why not? 8. Have you received any health related information (probe for respiratory illness)? Where did you get it? Which sources/channel are credible to you and why? How often do you view these sources/channels? 9. How should the government communicate with people during an epidemic? (Probe: by TV and radio, announcements after Friday prayers etc.).10. Has any of your health care providers ever given you any information about respiratory hygiene or advice on how respiratory infection can be prevented??Appendix 2: Focus group discussion guideline Guide for focus group discussion Instruction: Every focus group discussion needs to be interactive within the study group. In focus group discussions it is common that certain participants dominate, while others keep quiet. We want to hear everyone's views, so try to encourage everyone to contribute. Before beginning, explain to the participants that there is no right or wrong answer and that you just want to learn from them and hear what they think. Begin with a round of introductions. Each participant should introduce him/ herself.1. Please mention the name of any illness that you consider as respiratory. Is there any other local name for the illness?2. How respiratory infections pass on from one person to another?3. How respiratory disease transmission can be prevented?",
