The rationale for selection of these countries was based on facts that all three countries have a high standard of public health, universal coverage for health services, and high health care accessibility [3] [4] [5] . All three countries were in a state of high pandemic preparedness, had developed pandemic response plans, stockpiled personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral drugs [6] [7] [8] .

This revealed the tension between the public health approach in provision of information to the public and guidelines to PCPs, and personalized care that the patients expected to receive from PCPs. The next crucial issue was practice reorganization in order to introduce infection control measures.

The possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the provision of information from the official sources addressed the cognitive risk judgment of the population but not the \"emotional\" concerns. These were found to be significant predictors of behavioural responses during the initial stages of the 2009/A/H1N1 outbreak [40] . Also, it was reported that while about 90 % of members of the public across the UK were satisfied with the amount of information about the 2009/A/ H1N1, 37 % still had information they wanted to know [41] . Between the additional information that the public wanted to know, the most common types were details on symptoms, and advice on prevention and treatment [41] . Since these pieces of information represented concerns that are usually addressed during primary care consultations, this may provide an explanation for the high presentation rate of patients seeking personalized advice.",

It is likely that Israeli PCPs, who started to consult flu patients later in the pandemic, had a lower risk perception of the disease, compared to their Australian counterparts, which reduced the perceived usefulness of PPE and the infection control measures.
