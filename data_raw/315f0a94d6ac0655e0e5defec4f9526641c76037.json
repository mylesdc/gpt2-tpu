However, it is still unclear to what extent the antiviral activity of IFITM3 observed in cell culture translates into inhibition of HIV/SIV spread in the infected host. We have shown previously that although rhIFITM3 inhibits SIV entry into cultured cells, polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene are not strongly associated with viral load or disease progression in SIV infected macaques. Here, we examined whether rhIFITM3(2), which is closely related to rhIFITM3 at the sequence level, exerts antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene impact the course of SIV infection. We show that expression of rhIFITM3(2) is interferon-inducible and inhibits SIV entry into cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to rhIFITM3. We further report the identification of 19 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene. However, analysis of a well characterized cohort of SIV infected macaques revealed that none of the polymorphisms had a significant impact upon the course of SIV infection. These results and our previous work suggest that polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) genes do not strongly modulate the course of SIV infection in macaques.",

The antiviral effect of the IFN response is due to the IFN-induced expression of approximately 400 genes, many of which encode proteins that exert antiviral activity [1, 2] . The IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was identified in a screen for host cell factors modulating influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection [3] and inhibits host cell entry of FLUAV and several other viral pathogens [3] [4] [5] . Inhibition of viral a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 entry is believed to occur at the stage of hemifusion or fusion pore formation and may entail alterations of the biophysical properties of membranes [6, 7] , which in turn may require IFITM/IFITM interactions [8] . Importantly, intact IFITM3 is essential for defense against severe influenza [9, 10] , indicating the protein exerts potent antiviral activity in the infected host.",

IFITM3 was shown to inhibit host cell entry of HIV and SIV [11, 12] and to be incorporated into viral particles, which reduces viral infectivity [13] [14] [15] . Moreover, evidence has been provided that IFITM3 can interfere with the processing of the viral envelope protein (Env) by host cell proteases, which is essential for viral infectivity [16] . Finally, it has been demonstrated that transmitter-founder viruses, which successfully trespass the mucosal barrier and establish HIV infection upon sexual transmission, are highly resistant against inhibition by IFITM3 [17] . The same study also showed that IFITM3 is important for IFN-induced inhibition of HIV infection of cultured primary cells [17] . Collectively, these results indicate that IFITM3 might pose a barrier against sexual transmission of HIV/SIV and might modulate viral spread in the infected host. However, direct proof of a role of IFITM3 in HIV/SIV amplification in the host and in disease progression is still lacking.",

To this end, we incubated four rhesus macaque cell lines, sMAGI, MaMuK/8639, TeloRF and LLC-MK2 with pan-IFN\u03b1 and measured expression of huIFITM3, rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) by qRT-PCR. We found that pan-IFN\u03b1 treatment markedly stimulated expression of two known IFN-stimulated genes, MX1 and ISG56, by at least 100-fold (Fig 2A) . Expression of rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 (2) was also increased upon IFN treatment but induction of expression ranged from 3-fold (rhIFITM3) to 10-fold (rhIFITM3 (2)). Thus, expression of rhIFITM3 (2) is IFN-inducible and might contribute to control of virus infection. Therefore, we next studied whether rhIFITM3 (2) can interfere with host cell entry driven by the SIV-Env protein. We transfected 293T cells to express the SIV receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 and then transduced the cells with vectors encoding human or rhesus macaque IFITM proteins. Subsequently, we transduced the cells with luciferase-encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles bearing SIV-Env. In parallel, we examined particles harboring the Env protein of MLV or the hemagglutinin (HA) of FLUAV, because it is well known that MLV Env-driven entry is largely resistant to inhibition by IFITM3 while FLUAV-HA-mediated entry is highly sensitive [3, 4] . Immunoblot analysis revealed that all IFITM3 proteins analyzed were expressed in the transduced cells although relative expression was higher for huIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 than for rhIFITM3(2) (Fig 2B, S1 Fig) . Why rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) exhibited a slightly different gel migration is presently unknown but might reflect differential posttanslational processing. Expression of huIFITM3 had no impact on transduction mediated by MLV-Env but markedly reduced transduction driven by HA of FLUAV strain A/WSN/33 (Fig 2C) , as expected [3] . Moreover, huI-FITM3 reduced transduction mediated by the Env proteins of SIVmac239 and its macrophage tropic variant SIVmac316 by about 30%, in agreement with previous studies [12-14, 16, 18] (Fig  2C) . RhIFITM3 also diminished SIV-Env and FLUAV-HA-driven entry, although with reduced efficiency compared to huIFTIM3, in keeping with our previous findings [18] . Finally, rhIFITM3 (2) showed lower but detectable inhibitory activity compared to rhIFITM3 (Fig 2C) , potentially due to the reduced expression of the former (Fig 2B) . Collectively, these results indicate that rhI-FITM3(2) expression is IFN-inducible and that the protein exerts antiviral activity against SIV.",

The rhIFITM3(2) gene is localized on chromosome 14 and contains two exons that give rise to a predicted mRNA of 641 nts (Genbank entry XM_001085331). For the analysis of the rhIFITM3(2) sequence, a PCR strategy was followed that amplified 1360 bp covering the whole transcribed region. Subsequently, PCR products were directly subjected to sequence analysis, which identified 19 polymorphisms (Fig 3) . Two of the polymorphisms were located in the coding region of exon 1, three were present in the non-coding region of exon 2 and the remaining polymorphisms were intronic (Fig 3) . Most of the polymorphisms located in the non-coding regions were single nucleotide substitutions but insertion and deletion of single bases and, in one instance, five bases were also observed ( Table 2 ). One of the two polymorphisms located in the coding region resulted in an amino acid substitution, T70S. It affected one of the two positions within the conserved central part of IFITMs where rhIFITM3(2) is identical to huIFITM2 but differs from huIFITM3 (which codes for proline at this position). Heterozygosity and major allele frequency were usually both between 0.25 and 0.75, respectively ( Table 2 ). Only one polymorphism (g.1062 T>C) had a low heterozygosity (<10%) and three had a major allele frequency of > 0.90, including c.208 A>T that causes the T70S amino acid exchange.",

These findings, although not undisputed (see [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] for examples), indicates that polymorphisms in huIFITM3 can impact the course of viral infections. This notion has recently been reinforced by the finding that a polymorphism in the huI-FITM3 promoter that reduces IFITM3 expression increases the risk for severe influenza [44, 45] . Here, we investigated whether rhIFITM3(2) has antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in rhIFITM3 (2) impact the course of SIV infection. We showed that rhIFITM3(2) inhibits SIV Env-driven entry in cell culture, although not to the same extent as huIFITM3 and rhIFITM3, and that the rhIFITM3 gene is polymorphic.

Similar results were obtained for rhIFITM3(2) but inhibition efficiency was lower than with rhIFITM3. Moreover, blockade of SIV Env-driven entry by rhIFITM3(2) was less efficient than that by rhIFITM3. These differences in antiviral activity could be due to reduced expression of rhIFITM3(2) compared to rhIFITM3 However, it should be noted that an IFITM2 specific antibody was used to detect the proteins analyzed here and it is conceivable that amino acid exchanges present in rhIFITM3(2) altered the antibody epitope. In fact, previous analyses conducted with IFITM3 proteins harboring antigenic tags revealed that rhIFITM3(2) is more efficiently expressed than rhIFITM3 [27] . Nevertheless, rhIFITM3 (2) was less efficient at inhibiting Ebola virus The indicated rhesus macaque cell lines were incubated in the presence of pan-IFN\u03b1 (IFN, 100 U/ml, 24 h) or control-treated, before transcript levels for \u00df-actin (ACTB), MX1, ISG56, rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 (2) were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized against transcript levels for \u00df-actin (reference gene). Differences in the relative number of MX1, ISG56, rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 (2) transcripts between IFN-stimulated and control (mock)-treated cells were calculated by the 2 -\u0394\u0394 Ct-method [35] including normalization against ACTB (housekeeping gene control) levels, and are shown as expression fold change. The results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown and were confirmed in a separate experiment. Error bars indicate the standard deviation. (B) 293T cells were transduced to express the indicated IFITM proteins and expression was detected by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody raised against human IFITM2. Expression of \u03b2actin served as loading control. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) 293T cells were transfected to express rhesus macaque CD4 and CCR5 genes and then transduced to express either control (chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase, Cat), human (hu) and rhesus macaque (rh) IFITM3 or rhIFITM3 (2) glycoprotein-driven entry than rhIFITM3 [27] . Collectively, these results indicate that rhI-FITM3(2) can block viral entry and may thus contribute to inhibition of viral spread in the infected host but its antiviral activity might be lower than that displayed by rhIFITM3.",

In the more recently described scaffold Mmul_8.0.1 [46] sequences are switched between rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 (2) in exon 2 and downstream, which we did not observe in our analyses. However, we noted several polymorphisms within the intron sequences that appear to be present in both rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3 (2) . As a result, intron sequences from calculated haplotypes of both genes form mixed trees, whereas exon sequences cluster with their respective reference gene. We regard it as unlikely that this mixing is due to PCR artifacts, because additional gene-specific polymorphisms are interspersed between, or close to, these shared polymorphisms.",

In our previous report, we documented conditions for the specific amplification of rhIFITM3 that relied upon high annealing temperature (68\u02daC) and the exclusion of pseudogenes with a different size than rhIFITM3. These conditions served as a basis for the establishment of the rhIFITM3(2) specific PCR used here, of which the 3' primer, and for some reactions also the 5' primer, were adjusted to the rhIFITM3(2) sequence.

Thus, rhIFITM3(2) is more polymorphic than rhIFITM3, for which 16 polymorphisms were identified of which only six had a MAF \ufffd 75%. On the other hand, many polymorphisms of rhIFITM3(2) co-segregate, thereby yielding identical results in the survival and virus load analyses. Of the 19 polymorphisms identified in rhIFITM3(2), 14 were intronic and may thus not affect gene expression. However, an impact of these polymorphisms on RNA stability and pre-mRNA splicing cannot be excluded [48] . In this context, it is noteworthy that none of the polymorphisms altered a splice donor or acceptor sites or a branch point. Five polymorphisms were exonic and two were located in the coding region. One was silent but could nevertheless impact the efficiency of translation and protein folding [49] . The other polymorphism, c.208 A>T, resulted in an amino acid substitution, T70S, and had a MAF of 90%. The T70S exchange is located close to the intramembrane domain 1, the integrity of which has been found to be important for the anti-FLUAV activity of huIFITM3 [8] .

We cannot exclude that the analysis of a much larger sample size would reveal such associations. However, the impact of the respective polymorphisms on SIV infection is likely to be low and does not appear to appreciably alter the outcome of experimental SIV infection of macaques. In this context it should be noted that all our analyses were conducted with SIV from macaques (SIVmac), which is highly adapted to macaques. It is still possible that non-macaqueadapted SIVsm (SIV from sooty mangabeys, the precursor of SIVmac) is highly sensitive to rhIFITM3 and/or rhIFITM3(2) and that these factors limit cross-species transmission-a scenario that has been described before for TRIM5\u03b1 [50] and that warrants investigation in the case of the IFITM proteins as well. Collectively, this and previous studies suggest that changes in the sequences of rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) are rare and, if they occur at all, do not interfere strongly with antiviral activity, in keeping with the concept that IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes in non-human primates underwent purifying selection [51] .
