            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus that causes villus atrophy, followed by crypt hyperplasia, reduces the activities of intestinal digestive enzymes, and disrupts the absorption of intestinal nutrients. In vivo, TGEV primarily targets and infects intestinal epithelial cells, which play an important role in glucose absorption via the apical and basolateral transporters Na + -dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and facilitative glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), respectively. In this study, we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of TGEV infection on glucose uptake and SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression. Our data demonstrate that infection with TGEV resulted in increased glucose uptake and augmented expression of EGFR, SGLT1 and GLUT2. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that EGFR modulated glucose uptake in control and TGEV infected cells. Finally, high glucose absorption was subsequently found to promote TGEV replication. Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. EGFR and SGLT1 protein was dynamic. (A) Cells were treated with PBS, DMSO (100 nM), or AG1478 (100 nM) at 37\u02daC for 48 h. The culture medium from each group was then assayed. (B) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2, and \u03b2-tubulin. Experiments were performed separately three times. (C) The intensities of protein bands were quantified using Quantity One and SPSS software. (D) Cells were transfected with shEGFR, shEGFR control, pLVX-EGFR, or pLVX-EGFR control. After 48 h of incubation, culture medium from each group and from mock-infected cells was assayed. (E) The expression levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2, and \u03b2-tubulin proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Experiments were performed separately three times. (F) The intensities of protein bands were quantified using Quantity One and SPSS software. (G) IPEC-J2 cells were treated with phlorizin (500 \u03bcM) at 37\u02daC for 48 h, and culture medium from each group was assayed. (H) The expression levels of SGLT1, EGFR, and \u03b2-tubulin were evaluated by western blot analysis. (I) The intensities of protein bands were quantified using Quantity One and SPSS software. (J) IPEC-J2 cells were treated with three SGLT1-specific siRNA molecules for 48 h, and culture medium from each group was assayed.

Specifically, SGLT1 mediates the Na+/glucose cotransport function of the kidney and intestine as a secondary active transporter, while GLUT2 serves as a facilitated diffusion system for transport through lipid bilayers [4] [5] [6] . The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was previously reported to transiently increase glucose transport [7, 8] . Moreover, a recently study suggested that EGFR may act as another receptor for TGEV, in addition to porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) [9] . EGFR-dependent regulation of glucose uptake has been observed in tumor cells, and EGFR has been shown to prevent autophagic cell death by maintaining intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of SGLT1 [10] .",

The remainder of each sample was then used to determine protein expression levels of glucose transporters. The radioactivity counts of each sample were normalized with respect to the protein and corrected for time uptake per milligram of protein. All uptake measurements were carried out in triplicate. Glucose uptake was calculated as follows: glucose uptake (nM/10 6 cells) = (glucose concentration of the control group-glucose concentration of the experimental group)/cell number.",

IPEC-J2 cells treated with phlorizin for 48 h showed downregulation of SGLT1 expression without inducing cell death, as demonstrated by CCK8 assay analyses (data not shown). Similarly, western blot analysis showed that IPEC-J2 cells treated with phlorizin exhibited lower EGFR expression than DMSO-treated cells.

Consistent with this conclusion, we found that TGEV enhanced glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. Because glucose is the main energy source for cellular metabolism, TGEV replication in IPEC-J2 cells requires large amounts of glucose/energy. Thus, we explored whether high glucose uptake in TGEV-infected cells affected TGEV replication. TGEV contains a 27.6-31.3-kb singlestranded, positive-sense RNA genome; the virion RNA functions as an mRNA and is infectious. The N protein, in particular, is a critical component of the replication-transcription complex [24] [25] [26] . Thus, we treated TGEV-infected cells with medium containing 0.1, 1, 10, or 25 mM glucose and harvested the virus at 48 hpi. As shown in Fig 5A, glucose absorption concentrations were 0.1, 1, 1.8, and 5.2 mM for medium containing 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mM glucose, respectively. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that TGEV N protein was more abundant when TGEV-infected cells absorbed more glucose, particularly in medium containing 10 or 25 mM glucose (Fig 5B) . Consistent with this finding, there was a concurrent increase in the copy number of the TGEV N gene as glucose absorption levels increased (Fig 5C) . As described above, in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, higher glucose concentrations promoted TGEV replication. To exclude the possibility that cell viability and proliferation affect TGEV replication, flow cytometric analysis of CFSE-labeled cells was performed in the presence of 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mM glucose. As shown in Fig 5D-5F , high glucose concentrations did not significantly affect proliferation and viability.",

Because viral replication requires a lot of energy, we examined the effects of glucose absorption on TGEV propagation. Our results demonstrate that increased glucose absorption enhanced TGEV replication, suggesting that glucose may be transformed into glutamine in infected cells. In this study, increases in SGLT1 and GLUT2 protein expression directly stimulated glucose uptake in vitro. Although the role of other transporters cannot be ruled out, as SGLT1 and GLUT2 dominate intestinal glucose transport, they may play important effect on glucose uptake in TGEV infection. However, no significant changes were observed in SGLT1 or GLUT2 mRNA expression levels, indicating that TGEV infection primarily affects the protein expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2. These findings were consistent with previous reports demonstrating that TGEV infection influences protein translation. Additionally, SGLT1 and GLUT2 have been shown to mediate intestinal glucose uptake Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Promotes Increased Glucose Uptake through de novo synthesis of mRNA and protein [35] . Within the last decade, the mechanisms of passive or diffusive components of intestinal glucose uptake have come under debate [36] . The current paradigm describing intestinal uptake is that glucose enters the absorptive cell through SGLT1 in the brush-border membrane and exits into the blood through GLUT2, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, located in the basolateral membrane. We have now provided evidence for an alternative mechanism for the passive component of absorption, i.e., rapid trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane was found to be controlled by the SGLT1-dependent activation of a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway and also by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling pathways [37] [38] [39] . GLUT2 exhibits a >10-fold-higher glucose transport capacity than SGLT1 and provides a major route of glucose absorption with rapid absorptive capacity [40, 41] . GLUT2 plays an important role in glucose absorption across the brush border membrane in normal jejunum [42] . Although our experiments did not directly demonstrate the rapid trafficking of GLUT2, we found that TGEV infection significantly increased glucose uptake at 48 h, indicating accelerated glucose absorption. Thus, TGEV infection might promote glucose trafficking through GLUT2. Moreover, because the TGEV increased the protein expression of p-EGFR ( Fig 2B) and TGEV spike protein is capable of binding to EGFR, thereby activating the downstream PKC-dependent and MAPK intracellular signaling pathways [9] , the trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane could be stimulated, allowing rapid transport of glucose.",

GLUT1-mediated glucose transport regulates HIV infection [43] and is a receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV). Additionally, perturbations in glucose metabolism resulting from interactions between HTLV envelope proteins and GLUT1 are likely to contribute to HTLV-associated disorders [44] ; thus, analysis of the relationship between viral infection and glucose uptake is critical. Notably, in mock-infected cells, EGFR mediate SGLT1 protein expression. Indeed, previous literatures reported that EGFR maintains intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of SGLT1 [10] [18] . Importantly, we found that EGFR modulated SGLT1 expression during infection, but it cannot be concluded unfortunately that the cellular effect of TGEV infection on SGLT1 is mediated via EGFR. Because the drug treatment and knock down/overexpression against SGLT1 had similar effects with EGFR (Figs 3 and 4) . In other words, it could also be direct effect on SGLT1, which in results in similar effect on EGFR. In fact, EGFR and SGLT1 are co-expressed in many other type cells [45, 46] . Moreover, previous studies have shown that EGFR is a target receptor for viruses and bacteria, including TGEV and Escherichia coli [9, 47] . Thus, because EGFR also interacts with SGLT1, this protein might comprise another ubiquitous target receptor.",
