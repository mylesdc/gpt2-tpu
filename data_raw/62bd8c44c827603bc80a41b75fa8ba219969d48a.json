Codon usage preferences in BCoV in relation to the codon usage of Bos taurus were established by means of the use of the codon adaptation index (CAI) [23] . CAI was calculated using the approach of Puigbo et al. [24] . This method permits to compare a given codon usage (BCoV) to a predefined reference set (Bos taurus). In order to show whether the BCoV genes are well adapted to the codon usage of the reference set, as measured by CAI, we constructed a dataset composed of 22 Bos taurus genes selected at random and obtained from ARSA at DNA Database of Japan (available at: http:/http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ arsa). The RCSU values of those 22 Bos taurus genes were found to be similar to the RCSU values obtained from the Kazusa database (see Additional file 3). Moreover, a strong positive correlation are found among the RSCU of those genes and the RSCU obtained from Kazusa database by Spearmans'rank correlation test [25] (r = 0.956, P < 0.00001).",

Then, we calculated the CAI values for all of them, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the e-CAI of these random sequences was performed in order to show if the generated sequences follow a normal distribution. The results of these studies revealed an e-CAI value of 0.656. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed a normal distribution of the generated sequences (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of e-CAI value of 0.028, which is below the critical value of 0.061). To avoid the effect of extreme compositional constraint and to make sure that CAI is directly correlated with codon usage preferences, Puigbo et al. [26] suggested that if the eCAI value of a gene is higher than its CAI value, it may be considered as evidence of codon usage adaptation.

This is also in agreement with the results found in the phylogenetic analysis of BCoV strains enrolled in these studies (see Additional file 5: Figure S1B ) and with recent studies on genetic variability of coronaviruses, showing that BCoVs strains are distributed on three main sub-clusters named C1, C2, and C3 [6] . Subcluster C1 includes BCoVs from America and Asia, sub-cluster C2 includes BCoVs from Europe and subcluster C3 includes prototype, vaccine, or attenuated BCoV strains [6] . As can be seen in Additional file 5: Figure S1A , BCoV strains Mebus and Quebed, who belong to C3 cluster, are situated in different positions in the plane defined by the first two axes of COA in relation to C1 strains. Moreover, different genetic lineages of C1 sub-cluster are also located at different positions in the plane (Additional file 5: Figure S1A ). This is in agreement with the results found in the phylogenetic analysis of BCoVs enrolled in these studies (Additional file 5: Figure S1B ). Moreover, BCoV strain BCV-AKS-01, who shows a more distant genetic relation with C3 and C1 BCoVs enrolled in the studies (Additional file 5: Figure S1B ), is situated in a different position in the plane defined by the first two axes of COA (Additional file 5: Figure S1A ).

The under-representation of CpG might be due to its immunostimulatory properties as recognition of unmethylated CpG by Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9), which leads to activation of several immune response pathways in the host [37] . Moreover, an increase in CpG dinucleotide frequency has been shown to lead to attenuation of replication in RNA viruses [38] . Cytosine deamination and selection against CpG motifs have been proposed as two independent selection forces that shape codon usage bias in coronaviruses [39] , suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the observed BCoV codon usage bias. This is in agreement with the results of this work and indicates that the composition of dinucleotides also determines the variation in synonymous codon usage among BCoV.",

G + C compositional constraint influences the codon usage of BCoV. Dinucleotide composition also plays a role in the overall pattern of BCoV codon usage.
