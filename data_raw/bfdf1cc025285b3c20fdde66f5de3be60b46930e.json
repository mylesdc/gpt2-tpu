Given the high concentration of pro-inflammatory effectors at areas of viral infection, it is unclear how tissue pathology is limited while virus-infected cells are being eliminated. To better understand the spatial dynamics of the anti-inflammatory response to a cutaneous viral infection, we first screened cytokine mRNA expression levels after epicutaneous (ec.) VV infection and found a large increase the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Ex vivo analyses revealed that T cells in the skin were the primary IL-10-producing cells. To understand the distribution of IL-10-producing T cells in vivo, we performed multiphoton intravital microscopy (MPM) of VV-infected mice, assessing the location and dynamic behavior of IL-10 producing cells. Although virus-specific T cells were distributed throughout areas of the inflamed skin lacking overt virus-infection, IL-10 + cells closely associated with large keratinocytic foci of virus replication where they exhibited similar motility patterns to bulk antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Paradoxically, neutralizing secreted IL-10 in vivo with an anti-IL-10 antibody increased viral lesion size and viral replication. Additional analyses demonstrated that IL-10 antibody administration decreased recruitment of CCR2 + inflammatory monocytes, which were important for reducing viral burden in the infected skin. Based upon these findings, we conclude that spatially concentrated IL-10 production limits cutaneous viral replication and dissemination, likely through modulation of the innate immune repertoire at the site of viral growth.",

Anti-inflammatory proteins play an important regulatory role in limiting immune-mediated damage, but it is unknown where the cells making these modulators need to be for the greatest effect. The best-described Introduction Ideally, the antiviral immune response eliminates actively replicating virus and any viral reservoirs without undue host damage. For many viruses, however, the immune response extends beyond that necessary for viral clearance and creates disease symptoms. For example, infection with certain influenza virus (IAV) strains results in lung recruitment of high numbers of neutrophils (and other leukocytes) leading to a fast-progressing viral pneumonia and extensive lung damage [1, 2] . Neutrophil recruitment at late stages of infection can also lead to CNS pathology during coronavirus infection [3] . Virus-specific CD4 + T cells substantially contribute to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis in children [4] . Further, early RSV vaccination strategies actually enhanced disease due to excessive cellular infiltration of the lungs and subsequent pulmonary injury [5] . Thus, the immune response, essential for eliminating pathogens, also produces disease if not appropriately modulated.",

While IL-10 restrains host pathology caused by the immune response during acute infections with IAV, RSV, or coronavirus [12] [13] [14] , it can also limit viral clearance leading to chronic infection [15] [16] [17] .

The role of such poly-secretory CD8 + T cells appears to be dictated by both viral tropism and the site of infection, but the principle function ascribed to these cells is suppression of inflammatory tissue damage rather than direct alteration of viral replication. For example: antibody (Ab) blockade of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) during IAV infection increases lung inflammation and mortality without reducing viral burden [21] . Similarly, RSV-activated IL-10 + CD8 + effector T cells prevent RSV-induced inflammatory lung pathology [23] . During coronavirus-infection, IL-10 + CD8 + T cells limit CNS demyelination and slightly increase viral burden as a necessary cost [12] .

Intriguingly, IL-10 + T cells more closely localize to viral replicative foci than do the bulk population of antiviral CD8 + T cells in the tissue. Further, IL-10 + T cells move in paths adjacent to areas of virus infection, and neutralization of IL-10 enhances virus spread and shapes the innate immune population located adjacent to these foci. Together, our data demonstrate that spatially directed anti-inflammatory cytokine production inhibits viral dissemination within the infected tissue and illuminate a novel aspect of antiviral immunity.",

Over time, the mean fluorescence intensity of T cells was roughly equivalent, until CD4 + T cells acquired higher MFI at late times in infection ( Fig 1H) .

Although all CD8 + T cells that immigrated into infected skin were Ag-specific effectors, many cells did not accrue at the border of lesions but instead occupied areas of the tissue that were not overtly infected as determined by virusdriven fluorescence expression [26] . Since we did not observe this pattern in IL-10gfp + reporter mice (in which GFP-producing cells appeared to predominantly localize to lesions), we next used MPM imaging to compare the distribution of IL-10gfp + cells to adoptively transferred virus-specific T cells endogenously activated in IL-10gfp-reporter mice (Fig 5) . We first transferred non-IL-10gfp + dsRed + OT-I CD8 + T cells (antigen specificity = K b -SIINFEKL) into na\u00efve IL-10gfp reporter mice, then infected ec. On day 6 p.i.

Confocal microscopic montages of complete ears indicated an increase in VV-encoded fluorescence intensity and larger areas of fluorescence in anti-IL-10 NAb-treated mice (Fig 8A) . Closer examination revealed that many of the VV lesions in IL-10-neutralized mice exhibited \"satellites\" indicative of secondary virus spread [37] (shown in higher magnification in Fig 8B) . Quantitating total montage fluorescence revealed a 3-fold increase in VV-expressed GFP signal in IL-10 neutralized animals (Fig 8C) .

To begin to address these issues crucial to understanding antiviral immunity, we examined the production of the well-known anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during rVV infectionincluding real time visualization of IL-10-producing cells in infected skin. We uncovered an unlikely primary cellular source of this cytokine: highly activated effector T cells (Figs 1-3) localizing to the immediate vicinity of intense virus replication (Fig 4) .

While T cells clear infected inflammatory monocytes from the skin, Ly6G + monocytes also eliminate infectious virus. It is likely that many other immune cells types contribute synergistically to viral clearance. Here, we show that CCR2 + monocytes associate closely with virus-infected cells in the skin (even becoming infected (S7 Movie)), and also clearly aid in viral control (Fig 7) . Interestingly, nitric oxide has been shown to prevent productive replication of VV in some macrophages [41] .

Indeed, prior imaging studies of CD4 + T cells show that effector cytokine production is anti-correlative with movement [58, 59] . This uncertainty should be resolved with improved transgenic reporter systems that afford more precise measurement of ongoing IL-10 synthesis. Additionally, further study will be needed to carefully delineate the contributions of IL-10 generated by each T cell subset, as well as by those cells that are only minimally fluorescent in IL-10 reporter mice.",

With a critical role for IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells becoming evident for a number of widely different viruses, vaccines aimed at eliciting high numbers of multifunctional CD8 + T cells should consider adding IL-10 to the desired T cell-cytokine repertoire. Likewise, antiviral therapeutics that temporarily boost IL-10 levels in the tissue during acute infections may reduce viral burdens and hasten recovery, particularly if IL-10 can be delivered to the precise anatomical location where it is most effective.",

Mice were anesthetized with avertin or isoflurane. Ears were immobilized on an imaging platform and bathed in warm saline; a 20x dipping objective (NA 1.00) was dipped in saline overlying ears for image acquisition. For imaging BFP/collagen/eGFP, imaging was performed in sequential mode with the first laser tuned to 900 nm and the second tuned to 800 nm for BFP excitation. Emitted fluorescence was collected with a four-channel non-descanned detector. For blue/green channels, wavelength separation was accomplished with a dichroic mirror at 495 nm followed by emission filters of 460/50 nm bandpass and 525/50 nm bandpass. For most movies (e.g. when time was critical), images were acquired using 2x zoom, using a 3-\u03bcm z-step for a total depth of 150 \u03bcm for 1 min intervals between series (needed to switch lasers). For 3D reconstructions, images were acquired at 1x zoom using 1024x1024 resolution and 1 \u03bcm z-steps for a total depth of 80-300 \u03bcms.",

IL-10gfp + cells and autofluorescent hairs = green. Collagen (dermis) = blue. Scale bars = \u03bcm. Time = min. See also Fig 6. (MOV) S6 Movie. IL-10gfp + CD8 + T cells are mobile around VV lesions. Movie of MIP images taken 6 d.p.i. with VV-NP-S-BFP (pseudocolored magenta) over a 20 min. imaging session without adoptive transfer of other T cells. IL-10gfp + cells and autofluorescent hairs = green. Collagen (dermis) = blue. Time = min. Scale bars = \u03bcm. See also Fig 6. (MOV) S7 Movie. Mobile CCR2rfp + monocytes can be infected with VV. Movie of MIP images taken 6 d.p.i. with VV-NP-S-GFP (green) over an hr imaging session in an CCR2rfp + /mouse cells (red CCR2 + monocytes). Image was acquired 7 d.p.i. Movement of one virus-infected monocytes is highlighted with a circle. Collagen (dermis) = blue. Scale bars = \u03bcm. Time = min. See also Fig 7. (MOV) S1 Fig. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells produce IL-10 protein after epicutaneous vaccinia virus infection. A) Percentage of CD4 + T cells isolated from the skin producing IL-10 (determined by antibody staining for intracellular protein) on days 6, 12, and 13 post-infection with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ovalbumin (Vac-Ova). White bars = cells analyzed directly ex vivo. Black bars = cells that were restimulated for 5 hours with Vac-Ova. Pseudocolored dot plots for an individual animal on day 6 post-infection are shown on the right. IL-10 staining is on the x-axis. B) as in A) except gating on CD8 + T cells. N = 3 mice/group. Error bars = SEM. (TIF) S2 Fig. IL-10gfp + CD8 + T cells in VV-infected skin are not regulatory T cells on day 6 postinfection. Flow cytometric dot plot of single cell suspensions of ears 6 days post-VV-infection. Cells were gated on CD45 + cells, then on CD8 + T cells, then on CD8 + and FoxP3 + cells (stained intracellularly using a kit from eBioscience). Gate shows the percentage of FoxP3 + CD8 + T cells on day 6. (TIF) S3 Fig. Mobility of dermal IL-10gfp + cells on day 6 post-VV infection. A) Average cellular speeds of IL-10gfp + cells over 20 min imaging periods. Dots represent individual cells; groups represent different experiments. Means of average speeds are shown with a black bar. B) IL-10gfp + cell track straightness (track displacement/track length) C) Mean track length of IL-10gfp + cells over 20 min. D) Percentage of IL-10gfp + cells that were stopped or slowly motile, moving at average speeds less than 2.5 \u03bcm/min. Dots show the percentage of each of 8 experiments. (TIF) S4 Fig. Characterization of CCR2 + monocytes in VV-infected ears of CCR2rfp + / + , + / -, and -/mice. Monocyte populations in CCR2rfp null, heterozygous, and homozygous mice 7 days post-VV-infection. A) Flow cytometric plots of single cell suspensions generated from infected ears. Cells were gated on CD45 + leukocytes, then on CCR2 + CD11b + cells. (note: CCR2 was examined by cell-surface antibody staining due to lack of rfp detection on our cytometer) B) Numbers of CCR2 + monocytes per ear on day 7 post-infection. We selected heterozygous mice for further analysis because of the reduction in number of monocytes (similar to the effect of IL-10 treatment). (TIF) S1 Data. Supplemental data. (DOCX)",
