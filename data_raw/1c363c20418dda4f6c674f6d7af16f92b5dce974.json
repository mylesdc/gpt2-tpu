There are five major antibiotic targets: the bacterial cell wall, the cell membrane, protein synthesis, DNA and RNA synthesis, and folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolism ( Figure 1 ). These bacterial targets are different or nonexistent in eukaryotic cells (including those of humans), which means that antibiotics are relatively nontoxic drugs. For example, the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems block the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This structure is absent in higher organisms but is essential for bacterial survival. The bacterial ribosome is the target of the tetracycline, aminoglycoside, macrolide and other antibiotics, and is sufficiently different from the eukaryotic ribosome that cross-inhibition does not occur.",

Target modification can occur through mutation of the targets themselves -for example, the topoisomerases that are the target of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics -or by the production of enzymes that modify antibiotic targets, as, for example, in ribosomal methylation. Vancomycin resistance is a version of target modification where new biosynthetic machinery is engaged to alter cell-wall structure. Efflux occurs through a large family of protein pumps that eject antibiotics from inside the cell. In immunity, antibiotics or their targets are bound by proteins that prevent the antibiotic binding to its target. Arguably, the most specific and evolved mechanism of antibiotic resistance are enzymes that recognize antibiotics and modify them in such a way as to eliminate the functional characteristics that enable them to interact with their targets. For example, \u03b2-lactamases hydrolytically cleave the core \u03b2-lactam ring that is characteristic of the class and essential to antibiotic action.",

In the intervening years, resistance to all classes of antibiotics has emerged, and there are no antibiotics for which resistance does not exist. There are two general strategies for resistance. One comprises mechanisms that transfer resistance vertically from a bacterium to its progeny. Examples are mutations in chromosomal genes that give rise to drug-insensitive products, such as the point mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV that result in resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. The second strategy includes the actions of genes that can be transmitted both vertically to progeny and horizontally to other bacteria, even those of different genera. These genes are located on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, which can carry one or more resistance genes. Many of the \u03b2-lactamase genes that confer resistance to the penicillin, cephalosporin, penem and monobactam antibiotics are located on such elements, as is the glycopeptide-resistance gene cluster vanHAX, which provides resistance to vancomycin. The prevalence and mobility of resistance genes in previously sensitive pathogenic bacteria has now reached crisis levels in many cases because new antibiotics are no longer being developed at a rate that can keep pace with microbial evolution.",

This reflects the fact that these microbes live and have evolved in an environment where small bioactive molecules, some toxic, some benign, are plentiful and diverse. Bacteria have simply evolved to interact with them and control their biological effects. Pathogens, on the other hand, are often more virulent forms of our commensal bacteria and simply have not been exposed to the diversity and types of small molecules found in the environment; as a result, they have not required the gamut of resistance genes found in some environmental bacteria.",

Over the past several years, the medical community in particular has made concrete efforts to curb the improper use of antibiotics. The European Union has taken the lead in limiting the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food animals. Robust surveillance networks that span the clinic and the farm need to be supported in order to monitor the impact of resistance and the emergence of new threats in real time. In North America, efforts such as the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act seek to diminish antibiotic use in agriculture and improve surveillance.

Many of these 'natural' antibiotics have desirable drug-like qualities, such as good bioavailability, the ability to cross the cell membrane (and outer membrane in the case of compounds with Gram-negative activity) and the ability to evade efflux systems, and chemical structures that favor binding to vital cellular targets, supporting the idea that natural products encompass privileged structures in antibiotic drug discovery.
