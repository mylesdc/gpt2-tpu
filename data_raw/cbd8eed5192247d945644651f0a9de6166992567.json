They are responsible for 10-30% of all common colds, and infections occur mainly during winter and early spring [4] [5] [6] [7] . A third novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8] [9] [10] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SARS-CoV does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses, and therefore a tentative fourth group of coronaviruses was suggested [11, 12] . However, an early split-off of the SARS-CoV from the coronavirus group 2 lineage has also been suggested [13, 14] .",

The virus was isolated in January 2003 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 7month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis and fever. Screening of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms identified seven additional HCoV-NL63 infected individuals, both children and adults, between December 2002 and February 2003. The complete viral genome sequence was determined. The characteristic genome organisation of coronaviruses can be observed: the 5' two-third of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF1b. In the 3' part of the genome, genes encoding four structural proteins are found: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene, characteristic for group 2 coronaviruses, is not present in HCoV-NL63. Sequence analysis demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 shares 65% sequence identity with HCoV-229E. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that HCoV-NL63 is a new group 1 coronavirus, most closely related to HCoV-229E and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [15] . Shortly after van der Hoek and colleagues published their discovery of the new human coronavirus HCoV-NL63, a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus [16] . The virus was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in The Netherlands in April 1988. Real-time RT-PCR assays were designed for screening of respiratory tract samples. Four additional HCoV-NL63 positive samples, from children aged 3 months to 10 years, were detected between November 2000 and January 2001.",

Besides quick screening for several pathogens in one assay, it supplies the possibility to identify previously unknown coronaviruses. The consensus RT-PCR assay as described by Stephensen et al., designed to amplify all known coronaviruses, is not able to detect HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences [15, 17] . We modified these consensus primers based on an alignment of the HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence and 13 other coronavirus sequences (Figure 2 ). To determine whether the newly designed pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses the RT-PCR assay was tested on cell culture supernatant of the four known human coronaviruses and three animal coronaviruses: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Amplification of the expected 251 bp region was observed for all tested coronaviruses ( Figure 3 ). The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA. While 50 copies of HCoV-OC43 RNA copies per \u00b5l nasopharyngeal aspirate could be detected, the sensitivity for HCoV-NL63 was a bit lower i.e. 5 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies per \u00b5l nasopharyngeal aspirate.",

As a marker Molecular Weight Marker VI was used (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Inspection of the two full genome HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank demonstrates that especially the aminoterminal region of the Spike protein can be very divergent. Therefore we decided to amplify this region to investigate the variability of these region in our patients. An RT-nested PCR assay was used to amplify part of the S gene. These partial spike sequences showed 98% similarity with the HCoV-NL63 prototype strains. An alignment of the S gene sequences from the Belgian samples, partial spike sequences from the positive samples identified in The Netherlands (data not shown), and the prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences, was used to constitute a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. The neighbor-joining tree was evaluated by 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Two clusters can again be observed ( Figure 5 ).",

The common cold viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions in infants and immunocompromised patients [20] [21] [22] [23] . The clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-NL63 infections still need to be determined, but there are some indications that HCoV-NL63 can cause severe respiratory illnesses in children and immunocompromised adults [15, 16] . We detected HCoV-NL63, using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR, in patients suffering from relatively severe respiratory dis-eases necessitating hospitalization. These positive samples were collected from children aged 1 month to 16 years. Two patients suffered from severe underlying disease: one patient suffered from Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol metabolism. A second patient was diagnosed with VATER, a syndrome characterized by the sporadic association of specific birth defects or abnormalities such as vertebrae and vascular anomalies, anal atresia, trachea and esophagus problems and renal anomalities.

            "text": "Results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970's have led to the conclusion that human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks [22] . Our results indicate that HCoV-NL63 is the causal agent in a significant portion of respiratory diseases of unknown etiology. We detected HCoV-NL63 in respiratory samples collected in February 2003, with a frequency of 7.1%, and during February 2004, with a frequency of 2.5%. These results seem to support the tendency of human coronaviruses to circulate mainly during the winter season [7, 24] . However, in this study, sampling was only performed from January to May during the yearly RSV epidemic period, while no samples from the summer and autumn months were screened. The first publication on HCoV-NL63 showed that the virus circulated in Amsterdam during the winter months of 2002/ 2003 [15] . More recently another set of Amsterdam samples was screened, obtained during the winter of 2001/ 2002 and 2003/2004. HCoV-NL63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in February 2002, and in two oropharyngeal aspirates from December 2003 and January 2004, respectively (data not shown). Combined with the data that we present here from Belgium, these findings confirm that HCoV-NL63 reappears each winter season similar to the previously known respiratory viruses. Recently, research teams from Australia, Japan and Canada, have submitted partial HCoV-NL63 sequences to the GenBank database (AY600442-AY600446, AY662694-AY662698, AY675541-AY675553). This indicates that this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution.",

Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of part of the ORF 1a region of our patients showed the same subclusters of HCoV-NL63 that were described previously [15] ( Figure 4 ). This finding supports the suggestion that Phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene nucleotide sequences based on an alignment of the Belgian spike sequences, spike sequences from the positive samples identi-fied in The Netherlands, and the prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank Figure 5 Phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene nucleotide sequences based on an alignment of the Belgian spike sequences, spike sequences from the positive samples identified in The Netherlands, and the prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank. Accession numbers: HCoV-NL63, AY567487; HCoV-NL, AY518894. PEDV was used as an outgroup. several HCoV-NL63 subtypes with distinct molecular markers are cocirculating, also in Belgium. A large insert in the 5' part of the S gene of HCoV-NL63 compared with HCoV-229E has been described [15, 16] . Both HCoV-NL63 complete genome sequences show only 89% sequence identity in this spike insert region, which implies that there are at least two different HCoV-NL63 subtypes. Sequence analysis of this spike insert region revealed that our samples show similarity to both prototype HCoV-NL63 subtypes, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The partial S gene sequences cluster together with the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences in two different groups ( Figure 5 ). This confirms that the HCoV-NL63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are cocirculating. When analysing the dendrograms based on ORF1a and S gene sequences, a discordance in the clustering pattern of some HCoV-NL63 isolates (e.g. HCoV-NL and NL-p223) can be observed, suggesting a possible recombination event. Further research of complete genome sequences of these isolates is required. Drawing conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of one single gene therefore requires caution as the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analysing complete genome sequences.",

All positive samples were isolated during winter and early spring, which is concordant with the results of previous epidemiological studies. HCoV-OC43 infected samples were mainly identified during February 2003 and February 2004 ( Figure 1B) . These data show that the epidemic seasons of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 coincide. The positive samples were collected from children aged 1 to 12 years, whom all suffered from respiratory symptoms. The very low detection rate of HCoV-229E compared with the frequent detection of HCoV-NL63, might imply that HCoV-NL63, closely related to HCoV-229E, is currently more important as a causal agent of respiratory diseases. At the moment, there are no data concerning cross-neutralization between HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. In theory, such cross-neutralization might be possible, since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1. Antigenic crossreactivity has already been demonstrated between SARS-CoV and group 1 coronaviruses TGEV, FIPV and CCoV [25] .",
