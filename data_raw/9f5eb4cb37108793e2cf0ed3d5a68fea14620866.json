            "text": "Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method-logistic regression-to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.",

There are two types of TS mutants, heat-sensitive and coldsensitive, depending on whether the permissive temperature is lower or higher than the restrictive temperature. TS mutants offer a powerful tool for in vivo investigation of gene function. A simple temperature shift can control gene activity and be executed in any cell type. Thus, TS mutants have been used to investigate gene function in many organisms, including viruses, bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, and mammalian cell cultures [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . In fact, genetic analyses of yeast essential genes have been conducted primarily with TS mutants [7] .",

However, only one study has focused on TS mutations [28] . TS mutants are very interesting because they can shift between stabilizing and destabilizing states. They are stabilizing mutations at permissive temperatures but deleterious mutations at restrictive temperatures. In this study, we applied a machine learning method, logistic regression, to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features, with the goal to elucidate the molecular basis of TS mutations. Our results indicate that neighborhood properties are important determinants of TS mutations. Assembling features also allowed us to predict single amino acid substitutions most likely to confer a TS mutation. In this way, TS mutants can be easily generated through targeted mutagenesis. This mutational engineering strategy is in principle applicable to model systems from bacteria to mammalian cell cultures, and will greatly enhance our capabilities to characterize gene functions.",

The neighborhood is a group of residues located close to the mutated residue. We defined neighborhood based on three different distances: sequence, Euclidean, and topology. Most features have their counterparts in the three neighborhoods. Some features were derived from sequence information while others were derived from the PDB structural information. The features are described briefly here; the details are provided in Table S1 .",

We modelled hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions using Chimera [44] and counted the number of these interactions in the neighborhood. Neighborhood defined by topological distance. We further considered structural neighborhood based on relative distance, as opposed to the absolute Euclidean distance. The Delaunay tessellation divides the space spanned by a set of points into a collection of non-intersecting tetrahedra in three dimensions (3-D) (triangles in 2-D) [45, 46] . Consequently, Delaunay tetrahedra (DT) define clusters of four nearest neighbours. These clusters are not based on the use of an absolute distance cutoff, and hence are considered a more robust definition of nearest neighbours. Delaunay partitioning of 3-D space has been applied previously to proteins for modelling various aspects of structure and function, including fold recognition [47] , mutation effects [48] , and blind docking [49] . Our topological neighborhood includes residues that form a Delaunay tetrahedron together with the mutated residue, and are located within a sphere of certain radius centered on the mutated residue ( Figure 1 ). We used the coordinates of C a atoms when calculating distances. We counted all residues as well as residues by type in the topological neighborhood. A unique feature set in this category consists of the number and the type of Delaunay tetrahedra. There are five DT types based on the overlap between backbone and DT edges [47] ( Figure S1 ). We also calculated sequence conservation, physicochemical properties, residue buriedness, and thermal factors for residues in the topological neighborhood.",

In addition, two measures were calculated by taking multiple thresholds to define TS and neutral mutations: distribution distance (DD) and area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The measure DD determines how the predicted TS probability distribution differs from the predicted neutral probability distribution. The formula for DD is the same as that of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, but with the notations modified as follows. The range of the posterior probability (dependent variable) was divided into ten equal intervals. With i representing one such interval, P(i) is the probability of TS mutants in interval i, and Q(i) is the probability of neutral mutants in the same interval.

For the sequence neighborhood, we varied the number of neighbouring residues from 6 to 15. For both Euclidean and topological neighborhood, we varied the radius of the sphere from 6 \u00c5 to 15 \u00c5 (Figure 2 ). We found that the AUC value reached a plateau at 11 residues for the sequence neighborhood. Thus, we included 11 residues upstream and 11 residues downstream of the mutation site as the sequence neighborhood. The AUC value for the Euclidean neighborhood gradually increased with the radius and then reached a plateau at 13 \u00c5 . In contrast, the AUC value of the topological neighborhood stayed close to a constant in the radius range of 7-15 \u00c5 . This observation is consistent with the definition of Delaunay tetrahedra, which robustly cluster four nearest neighbours together. We chose to use the same cutoff value (13 \u00c5 ) for the topological and Euclidean neighborhood so that the results are comparable. When comparing the performance of 20-D vectors of the three neighborhoods, we observed that the two structural neighborhoods were more predictive of TS mutations than the linear sequence neighborhood ( Figure 2 ). The optimal cutoff identified by the 20-D vector was applied to the calculation of other neighborhood features.",

To this end, the identification of predictive features for TS mutations will enhance our understanding of TS mechanism and help engineer TS mutants for gene functional study.

Values of ACC, MCC, KL, DD, and AUC were calculated from cross-validations to rank the 133 features (Table S2, Table S3 ). The top-20 predictive features for TS mutations are listed in Table 3 . We found that neighborhood features dominate the top-ten list, suggesting that neighborhood properties are more predictive than mutation site properties in determining TS mutations. The most predictive feature was the 20-D vector of residue counts by type in the Euclidean neighborhood (AUC = 0.79). The similar 20-D vectors of the topological and sequence neighborhood were highly predictive as well, ranking as the 3 rd (AUC = 0.75) and 11 th (AUC = 0.72) most predictive features, respectively. The 20-D vector feature performed much better than the total residue counts in the Euclidean neighborhood (AUC = 0.79 versus 0.66) as well as in the topological neighborhood (AUC = 0.75 versus 0.63) (Table S2 ).

Further, it only considered mutations on buried residues while our method ranks mutations on all residues. To objectively compare the performance of our method with the existing one, we tested them on the independent mutation data of HIV-1 protease. However, only six out of 124 mutations were predicted to have confidence score using the existing method; the rest are either not on buried residues or have no confidence score. Performance comparison based on these six mutations (3 TS and 3 neutral) is shown in Figure 8 .

Same training data and same feature set were used for SVM as those for the ''all features'' model. The SVM classifier was trained and built with Matlab interface for the Libsvm package [57] . Different kernel functions were tested, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function. The best combination of parameters was selected by a grid-search. Based on a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the best-performed SVM classifier with polynomial kernel using degree of 3, SVM parameter c of 0.004, and penalty parameter C of 0.00011. The AUC of this SVM classifier was 0.91, which is same as that of the ''all features'' model; both classifiers were evaluated via the identical cross validation procedure.

Pearson correlation is only sensitive to a linear relationship between two variables while mutual information is capable of detecting non-linear relationships. We found that AUC and DD had the best concordance according to mutual information and the third best concordance according to the Pearson correlation.

As such, we tested sequence and structure features individually first, and then built eight different TS prediction models. We assembled 133 features to describe property changes occurring at mutation sites and in mutation site neighborhoods. Three neighborhoods were defined based on sequence, Euclidean, and topological distances. Our results highlight the importance of neighborhood features in predicting TS mutations. The top-predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid regions and tend to locate at conserved domains. This perfectly explains the importance of neighborhood features. Buried residues and the environment of buried residues contribute greatly to protein stability. Thus, TS mutations represent temperature-induced changes in protein stability. The change in protein stability leads to reversible functional changes.",

Many features that were top-ranked individually, such as the residue counts by type in the neighborhood, were selected by the Lasso procedure for TS prediction models. Ideally, the ''all features'' model would be used to predict TS mutations. However, when protein structural information is absent, we could use the ''sequence features'' model for broader application. Both ''all features'' and ''sequence features'' models predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision through test on independent datasets. This is a dramatic enrichment as compared to 4-6% TS mutations out of all possible single amino acid substitutions [10, 11, 12] .
