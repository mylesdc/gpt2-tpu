Casein-degrading serine protease autotransporter of enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) subfamily protein SigA, an outer membrane protein, exerts both cytopathic and enterotoxic effects especially cytopathic to human epithelial cell type-2 (HEp-2) and is shown to be highly immunogenic. In the present study, we have tried to impose the vaccinomics approach for designing a common peptide vaccine candidate against the immunogenic SigA of Shigella spp. At first, 44 SigA proteins from different variants of S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei were assessed to find the most antigenic protein. We retrieved 12 peptides based on the highest score for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes analysed by NetCTL. Initially, these peptides were assessed for the affinity with MHC class I and class II alleles, and four potential core epitopes VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, and IELAGTLTL were selected. From these, FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL peptides were shown to have 100% conservancy. Finally, IELAGTLTL was shown to have the highest population coverage (83.86%) among the whole world population. In vivo study of the proposed epitope might contribute to the development of functional and unique widespread vaccine, which might be an operative alleyway to thwart dysentery from the world.",

The resulting infection by this organism called shigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery or Marlow syndrome, is most typically associated with diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. This pathogen is usually found in water that is contaminated with human feces within the setting of poor hygiene among kids of underneath 5 years old and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The infection will occur even if there is just a bodily function of only ten to one hundred microorganisms [1] . In each year, 165 million cases of Shigella infection are accounted worldwide, of that, 163 million take place in developing countries and ultimately result in millions of death [2] . Bangladesh has got the top rates of shigellosis according to the recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in Asia. The output of this study has revealed that the Shigella is the third leading reason behind diarrhoea in children [3, 4] .",

Earlier, ciprofloxacin, a third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been used effectively for the treatment of bacillary dysentery [6] . However, this antibiotic is no longer helpful for the treatment of bacillary dysentery in south Asian countries together with Bangladesh, because of the dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant variety and its equivalent clones across the countries [7, 8] .

The autotransporter proteins of Gramnegative bacteria exhibit an N-terminal signal sequence, required for secretion across the inner membrane, and a Cterminal domain that forms an amphipathic \u03b2-barrel pore that allows passage of the functional domain across the outer membrane. This type of exporter proteins either remains attached to the cell surface or is released from the cell by proteolytic cleavage [9] . SigA is a multifunctional protein, able to degrade casein with cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects. Moreover, SigA is cytopathic for human epithelial type-2 (HEp-2) cells, causing morphological changes and loss of integrity of the cell monolayers, important for the pathologic process of Shigella [10] . The position of SigA in the chromosome made them less vulnerable to loss compare to the other virulence factors harbouring within the plasmid, and more exposure to the immune cells occurred by this secreted toxin [11] . Most importantly, this protein has been shown to be immunogenic following infection with Shigella [10] . The generalized modules of membrane antigen-(GMMA-) based outer membrane proteins including SigA were also shown to be highly immunogenic [12] , which prompted us to target SigA as one of the best vaccine candidates and to design potential peptide vaccine covering all the Shigella spp. and most of the regions of the world.",

The peptide IELAGTLTLT was predicted to have the highest number of MHC class I binding. This peptide was predicted to have the binding affinity with five MHC class I alleles including HLA-E * 01:01, HLA-B * 40:01, HLA-B * 15:02, HLA-C * 03:03, and HLA-C * 12:03. Furthermore, the interacted alleles were reassessed by cluster analysis and are shown in Figure 2(a) , as a heat map, and in Figure S1A , as a dynamic tree. The peptides were reassessed by the EPISOPT software for the HLA I binding, and IELAGTLTL was found to have affinity with six HLA I alleles (Table S3) . From this analysis, we selected top four peptides VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, and IELAGTLTL depending on the affinity with most MHC class I. Epitopes for the MHC class II alleles are presented in Table 3 . Depending on the IC 50 values as well as on the number of MHC class II alleles, three 15-mer peptide candidates were selected. The peptides NSGFHTVTVNTLDAT, KAIELAGTLTLTGTP, and AAKSYMSGNYKAFLT were predicted to have high affinity with MHC-II allele, which can interact with 32, 29, and 24 MHC class II alleles. The data has been validated by another software PREDIVAC. The predivac scores of the two core peptides FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL have been shown to be promising for their binding to HLA_DRB_1 (Table 3) . Accumulating both MHC class I allele-and MHC class II allele-based analyses, we showed FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL peptides to have the best score to be a vaccine potential.",

Molecular Docking Analysis. The core epitope (IELAGTLTL) with 9.0 mer and its 15-mer extension (KAIE-LAGTLTLTGTP) were bound in the groove of the HLA-E * 01:01 and HLA-DQA1 with an energy of \u22127.8 and \u22129.7 kcal/mol, respectively. AutoDock Vina generated different poses of the docked peptide, and the best one was picked for the final calculation at an RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) value of 0.0. The docking interface was visualized with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. The 9.0-mer epitope interacted with Arg-61, Asn-62, and Glu-152 through steric interaction and formed hydrogen bonding with the Glu-156 amino acid residues. On the other hand, the 15-mer epitope interacted with Asp-55 through electrostatic interaction and Glu-66 through steric interaction and formed hydrogen bonding with the Gly-58, Arg-61, Asn-62, and Asn-82 amino acid residues. The docking output and the interacted residues are shown in Figures 7 and 8 with different orientations. Furthermore, the control docking energy was found to be \u22126.8 kcal/mol and is illustrated in Figure S4. 3.8. Allergenicity Analysis. The AllerHunter web server predicted the sequence-based allergenicity calculation very precisely. The allergenicity of the queried core epitope (IELAGTLTLT) was 0.05 (sensitivity = 98.40%, specificity = 27.4%), and the allergenicity of the 15-mer epitope (KAIELAGTLTLTGTP) was 0.05 (sensitivity = 98.4%, specificity = 27.0%).",

Peptide surface accessibility is another important benchmark to meet up the criteria of a potential B-cell epitope. Henceforth, Emini surface accessibility prediction was employed, with a maximum propensity score of 1.137 (Figure 9 (b)).

The ever rising multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the Shigella bacteria area unit are another international concern for the researchers to search out a brand new resolution for preventing the deaths [50, 51] . Recently, there are several studies that focus on the development of the vaccine against Shigella and continue in the clinical trial. Most of them use attenuated and inactivated preparation of the bacteria for eliciting immune responses which has some potential escape risk [52] [53] [54] . In this study, we have tried to find out alternatives to treat this global burden through vaccinomics approaches and targeting the immunogenic and toxic protein SigA. The sequences of different strains of Shigella showed that there is a little island of conserved sequence throughout the species [55] , and we have focused on that target for designing the vaccine candidate. The orthologous entry search of our targeted protein revealed no significant similarity with human pathogens and other closely related pathogens. These results further strengthen our prediction through confirming no cross immunity. In recent time, most of the vaccines are grounded on Bcell immunity; vaccines based on a T-cell epitope have been invigorated lately. This is often as a result of body substance response from memory B-cells which may be overawed basically by matter drift as time goes on, whereas cell-mediated immunity repeatedly delivers long-run immunity [56, 57] .",

Finally, through substantiation with different parameters, the core epitopes IELAGTLTL and FHTVTVNTL (in 15.0-mer form, KAIELAGTLTLTGTP and NSGFHTVTVNTLDAT, resp.) were found to be the most potential and highly interacting HLA candidates for MHC class II molecule. Furthermore, we have used pSORTb to predict the subcellular localization of SigA and found that there is a score of 5.87 for localization in the outer membrane and another score of 4.13 for extracellular localization.

Our bioinformatic analyses speculate that the selected part of the outer membrane and highly immunogenic protein, SigA, is a potential candidate for a peptide vaccine. It might also contribute to the reduction in the SigA-mediated pathogenicity to the host. However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm the efficiency of our identified peptide sequence as an epitope vaccine against Shigella. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte TAP:",
