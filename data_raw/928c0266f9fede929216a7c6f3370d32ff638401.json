Methods: Multiplex reverse-transcription PCR was performed for the detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirat. Disease severity was grouped using a categorization index as very mild/mild, and moderate/severe. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children with viral respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results: Viral pathogens were detected in 103/155 (66.5%) of patients. In order of frequency, identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (32.0%), adenovirus (26.2%), parainfluenza viruses type 1-4 (19.4%), rhinovirus (18.4%), influenza A and B (12.6%), human metapneumovirus (12.6%), coronavirus (2.9%), and bocavirus (0.9%). Coinfections were present in 21 samples. Most of the children had very mild (38.8%) and mild disease (37.9%). Severity of illness was not worse with coinfections. The most common discharge diagnoses were \"URTI\" with or without LRTI/asthma (n=58). Most viruses exhibited strong seasonal patterns. Leukocytosis (22.2%) and neutrophilia (36.6%) were most commonly detected in patients with adenovirus and rhinovirus (p<0.05). Monocytosis was the most remarkable finding in the patients (n=48, 53.3%), especially in patients with adenovirus (p<0.05).",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most commonly encountered diseases for hospitalization, particularly in infants and young children. These are the major causes of morbidity and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 112 900 000 and 3.5 million deaths, respectively [1] . RTIs are divided into two categories, as acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) according to localization of the infection. LRTIs are more harmful than URTIs. URTIs refer to infections of the nasopharynx, larynx, tonsillae, sinuses, ears, including rhinosinusitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis/ laryngotracheitis and otitis media. LRTI refers to infections of the trachea, bronchus, and alveolus, including tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. The etiological agents include many bacteria, viruses and fungi. However, viral agents have a greater role in causing RTI as they are more commonly observed. In recent years, many viruses causing RTI have been discovered, including coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus and human bocavirus. Detection of these viruses relies on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in virology laboratories. As the agents of RTIs, viruses have constantly been shown to predominate; this majority of the viral agents may be related to the increased use of the PCR in the detection of viruses.",

The inclusion criteria for this study were: 1) children <9 years of age; 2) hospitalization at the pediatric ward of the Yeditepe University Hospital, between November 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011; and 3) a diagnosis of acute RTI, including URTI, acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. The diagnosis for each patient was performed by the attending physicians based on standard clinical criteria. Bronchiolitis was recognised in patients <24 months in whom lower respiratory symptoms of wheezing, tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress such as nasal flaring, intercostal/subcostal retractions, and central cyanosis were observed. The diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was established on clinical findings which include fever, tachypnea and respiratory distress where focal or diffuse crackles or decreased vesicular sounds and radiographic findings such as infiltration and/or atelectasia, and/or air bronchograms were present. The diagnosis of URTI (including laryngotracheitis) was established on the basis of symptoms such as coryza, cough, earache, fever, sore throat, headache, and stridor.",

Disease severity was assessed by using a categorization index which was similar to categorization of disease (viral RTIs) severity by Bezerra et al. [8] , as follows: Baseline vital signs including fever, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and pulse rate were listed at the time of assessment in the pediatric emergency department and daily afterward following admission in all patients. Patients with at least two symptoms and/or signs of RTI including fever, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal flaring, intercostal/subcostal retractions, and central cyanosis, received a posterior nasal swab for virus detection, generally within five days of symptom onset.

Nucleic acid PCR types of laboratory tests with short durations (of less than 24 hours) have become available and with high sensitivity. This study clearly demonstrates the clinical manifestations, clinical severities and seasonal patterns of respiratory viral agents of URTI and LRTI in Turkish children. Furthermore, it provides new information on the epidemiology of viral agents in children by assessing the significance of RSV, MPV, RhV, AdV, and the newly identified viruses (PIV4, CoV, BcV).

Similar rates (between 11.1% and 39.6%) were found in other PCR based studies [10, 11, 13, 14] . Sensitive RT-PCR assays make it possible to identify a large spectrum of viral agents, but an identified virus may be concerned with persistence of a virus after a recently afflicted RTI. RhV and BcV may persist in the upper airways for a long duration. Up to two months of persistence has been shown in nasopharynx [14] [15] [16] [17] . AdV shedding with the faeces may persist for a long time after an acute infection [18] ; however, extended shedding of AdV in the nasopharynx was not documented. For this reason, this persistence also may not occur in the nasopharynx. However, identification of two or more viruses in a patient may be due to prolonged viral shedding or asymptomatic persistence of viruses and further work would be needed to clarify this situation. Identification of the viral genome quantitively may be helpful in explaining coinfections. Evidence pertaining to the severity of coinfections compared to single viral infections is conflicting. In our study, coinfections were not more severe than single infections. The presence of coinfections was not associated with extended duration of fever. The severity of coinfection may depend on the viruses involved. In contrast with some previous studies [4, 19, 20] , coinfections were not more severe than single infections in this study. Other studies conducted do support this finding [5, 6] . This may have resulted due to smaller numbers of patients in the moderate and severe categories.",

PIV1-4 was detected with other viruses in 38% of the coinfected patients, especially with RSV.",

It is the most common cause of URTI (especially common cold) in both adults and children. RhV may also be associated with LRTI [24] , and was detected in 14-24% of hospitalized children with LRTI [25, 26] . RhV may now be considered a major cause of LRTIs in infants [27] and of asthma-triggering in children [28, 29] and adults [30] . The role of RhV in asthma exacerbations was documented by Johnston et al.; it accounted for 65% of virus-induced asthmatic attacks [28] . Studies in recent years [14, 31] have shown higher rates of viruses in children hospitalized for asthmatic attacks; however, studies in the later years [32] have shown lower rates (19% to 42%) compared to recent studies. The more extensive use of PCR for virus identification in recent years may be responsible for the higher rates in recent studies.",

Bezerra et al. reported that, AdV was the second most common virus associated with RTI hospitalization [8] . Similar to other studies, AdV was also commonly identified but not associated with severe illness [8] . Hospitalized patients with AdV have symptoms of URTI (81.5%) and LRTI (18.5%). Fever (92.6%) was the most commonly encountered symptom in hospitalized children with AdV. The duration of fever in this infection was more prolonged (up to 120 hours) in our patients, compared to other viruses; this finding was similar to other studies [36] . Dehydration (11.1%), febrile convulsion (7.4%) and tachypnea (3.7%) were encountered rarely in these patients. Chen et al. reported that, fever was recorded for 98.7% of patients with AdV, and the mean level of fever was 39.2\u00b0C [37] . While the mean duration of fever was 4.8 days in their patients, our patients experienced a similar duration (4.63 days). Other symptoms and signs include cough (77.6%), rales (23.3%), diarrhea (25.2%), vomiting (21.8%), abdominal pain (18.9%), conjunctivitis (13.6%), rashes (7.9%), and febrile seizure (3.1%) as reported by Chen et al. [37] . The peak incidence of AdV occurred among children 2-5 years of age in our study, while Chen reported the peak to occur between 4 and 8 years of age in Taiwan [37] . Similar to our study, other studies reported that most AdV infections occurred among children under 5 years of age [36, 38] . Children hospitalized with AdV were less likely to have LRTI, and were older than patients with other viruses. The mortality rates were reported in patients with AdV in Korean (19%) [38] and Argentinean (28.6%) [39] children. There was no mortality in patients with AdV, similar to the Chen report [38] . Our patients with AdV mostly had URTI, such as tonsillitis and pharyngitis (81.5%), with a few patients with LRTI (18.5%). In a national report prepared for 2006-2007, AdV was detected in 5.6% of children hospitalized with acute LRTI, but, clinical characteristics were not investigated [10] . Similar to the rate reported in this study viruses were detected in LRTI, but not URTI. AdV was shown in LRTI in our study group in 4.8% of patients. Furthermore, AdV was identified during February through July with peaks in April and June. AdV was detected with other viruses in 33% of coinfected patients, especially with RhV. Viral infections are known to cause hematologic complications particularly cytopenies. Leukocytosis may also occur in viral infections, as well as bacterial infections. Lymphopenia was the most common form of cytopenia that was seen in viral infections, particularly with FluA&B [40, 41] . Lymphopenia was the most notable finding in our cases with FluA&B in children two years or older. The main hematologic manifestation of influenza is lymphopenia with decreased lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were detected in the patients with AdV and RhV. Monocytosis was the most significant finding in the patients with AdV. There was not any negative effect on the hematologic conditions of coinfections.",

Furthermore, RSV, AdV, PIV and RhV were detected in over two-thirds of hospitalized patients with RTI. RSV was found to account for half of LRTI hospitalizations. PIV, MPV and RhV were associated with LRTI. Our study summarizes the clinical characteristics of viral agents that were detected in children with RTI. The severity of diseases caused by RSV and RhV were higher than other viruses. In AdV and FluA&B infections, fever lasted longer than in other viruses. Coinfections were detected in 21% of the patients, especially with some pathogens, such as RhV and MPV, whereas, AdV and RSV were more commonly identified as single infections. The presence of coinfections was not associated with increased disease severity. RSV, Flu A&B, AdV, CoV and MPV exhibited strong seasonal patterns, with Flu A&B and MPV cases peaking over the rainy season (January-May and March-May, respectively), and AdV peaking soon afterwards (April-July). RhV and PIV were endemic throughout the year, although RhV activity did appear to decrease between December-March and RSV activity did appear to decrease after May. Different PIVs circulated at different times of the studied year. ",
