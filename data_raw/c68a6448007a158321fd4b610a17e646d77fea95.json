Data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including A/H1, A/H3, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. Of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. Patients with A/H1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as ICU admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.5, P = 0.016), pneumonia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.7, P < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; HR 0.64 95% CI 0.47-0.88, P = 0.005), than patients with A/H3. Patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with A/H3. Patients hospitalised with A/H1 had higher odds of severe outcomes than patients with A/H3 or other respiratory viruses. Knowledge of circulating influenza strains is important for healthcare preparedness.",

This results in a substantial additional burden of hospital admissions each winter, both internationally and within Australia [2] . The severity and clinical impact of an influenza season varies from year to year and depends on a number of factors such as vaccination efficacy and circulating influenza strain. Early evidence analysing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggested that influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1) may have more severe clinical impacts than other seasonal influenzas [3, 4] . This evidence continues to be supported in the post-pandemic years with several studies showing that patients with A/H1 have an increased risk of severe disease compared to patients with influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) [5, 6] .",

SCGH is a large adult tertiary teaching hospital with over 600 beds located in Perth, Western Australia. It treats approximately 93 000 inpatients and 60 000 Emergency Department presentations annually [16] . Patients aged 18 years and above who were admitted to SCGH with a respiratory illness were included in this study. The hospital information system data from that time period were searched using the following codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) to capture all patients presenting with a possible respiratory illness: J00-J06 (acute upper respiratory infections), J09-J18 (influenza and pneumonia), J20-J22 (other acute lower respiratory infections), J40-J47 (chronic lower respiratory diseases), J80 (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and J81 (pulmonary oedema). ICD-10-CM codes were selected to capture all patients who may have received a respiratory viral test. Data from patients meeting the search criteria in their primary diagnosis code, or in up to four further diagnosis/complication codes, were retrieved from the information system. These codes were also used to determine if patients had comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, compromised immunity, asthma or cystic fibrosis. Although pregnancy and obesity are recognised risk factors for severe influenza, they were not included in this study due to very low numbers of patients identified through the ICD-10 codes. Available patient data also included patient demographics, admission and discharge dates, discharge codes and number of hours spent in ICU or on ventilation.",

Age was categorised into three categories (18-49 years, 51-64 years and 65 plus) to reflect current Australian recommendations for influenza vaccination [19] . For univariate analysis of categorical variables, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and \u03c7 2 or Fisher's exact test were used where appropriate to assess statistical significance of relative risks. We used the Students t test or Mann-Whitney U test to assess statistical significance of differences in continuous variables between groups. Severity was compared between A/H1, A/H3 and the other viruses using seven outcome variables: diagnosis of pneumonia, admission to ICU, requirement for assisted ventilation, time to discharge, time in ICU, time on assisted ventilation and death. Multivariable models (logistic or Cox regression) were constructed for each outcome, comparing patients with INF-B, RSV, hMPV or PIV to those with A/H1 or A/H3. For the categorical outcome variables of ICU admission, ventilation and pneumonia (all yes/no), logistic regression was used. We used Cox Proportional Hazards Regression to assess differences in the risk of discharge between patients with different viral infections at any particular point in time, as an indicator of length of hospitalisation. Deceased patients were excluded from the Cox regression models. Patients with no virus detected, multiple viruses detected or influenza A unsubtyped, were excluded in all multivariable models. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. The following variables were included in the initial model: virus type, age group, sex, COPD, CVD, diabetes, immunocompromised, asthma and cystic fibrosis. Variables were removed consecutively from the model in order of descending P-values, so that they were only retained if they were significant (P < 0.05) or showed evidence of confounding, with the exception of sex and age group which were retained for all models. A variable was determined to be a confounder if the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted OR was greater than 15%.",

However, the presence of comorbidity was significantly less likely in patients with A/H3, compared to those with RSV or hMPV. Co-morbidities were also less frequently present in patients with A/H1, however statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.074 and 0.067 for hMPV and RSV respectively). The lower number of comorbidities in patients with influenza may be due to a high proportion of people with comorbidities receiving the annual influenza vaccine, but vaccination status for the patients in our study was not available. Another possible explanation for our findings is that influenza A is capable of causing hospitalisation in relatively healthy people, whereas the other viruses may cause less severe disease in patients without comorbidities.",

Rhinovirus in particular has been implicated in previous studies as a possible cause of severe respiratory disease, having been detected in a large proportion of hospitalised patients [11, 21, 22, 27] . In addition it has also been shown that influenza A and rhinovirus infections have similar measures of severity in immunocompromised patients [36] .",

In 2015, influenza vaccination coverage rates in Australian hospitalised patients with acute respiratory illness was estimated to be 80.2% in patients aged over 65, and 57.9% in adults under 65 with comorbidities, with the proportion of patients requiring ICU being slightly lower in the vaccinated group than the unvaccinated group (5.7% vs. 8.6%) [37] . Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation in the elderly and people with comorbidities varies according to the matching of the vaccine strains with circulating strains [38] . While we found that non-influenza respiratory viruses can cause just as severe disease like influenza, we cannot say if this would be the case in an unvaccinated population. It is possible that influenza vaccination reduced both the frequency and severity of influenza hospitalisations, therefore this should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study. We did not have information about the influenza vaccination status or antiviral treatment for the cases in our study. Therefore we are unable to assess whether either treatment or vaccination attenuated the clinical picture of influenza cases. In addition, while attempts were made to minimise detections of nosocomial influenza, the presence of nosocomial cases in our study cannot be excluded.",

The selection of ICD-10-CM codes used in this study to identify patients with respiratory illness was broad, which may account for the small proportion of testing. In addition, pathology testing for respiratory viruses was proportionally higher in winter compared to the non-winter months in our study (data not shown). Infections during the non-winter months may have been missed due to lower rates of testing [39] . In our study the rate of ICU admission among tested patients was higher than that of untested patients, therefore we cannot discount that a selection bias may exist for testing of severely ill patients which could skew results. In addition insufficient power may have been a limitation of this study. Additional studies are needed to further investigate the level of severity of disease in hospitalised cases with noninfluenza respiratory virus infections. We have found that hospitalised patients with influenza A/H1 had more severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H3, INF-B and the non-influenza respiratory viruses. Knowledge of the influenza strains circulating and their associated clinical outcomes will aid in hospital preparedness during the influenza season. Future research is needed to investigate the impact of a broader range of viruses associated with respiratory hospitalisations.",
