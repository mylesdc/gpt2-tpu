            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health concern affecting millions of individuals with a wide variety of currently circulating subtypes affecting various regions of the globe. HIV relies on multiple regulatory proteins to modify the host cell to promote replication in infected T cells, and these regulatory proteins can have subtle phenotypic differences between subtypes. One of these proteins, HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat), is capable of RNA interference (RNAi) Silencing Suppressor (RSS) activity and induction of cell death in T cells. However, the subtype-specific RSS activity and induction of cell death have not been explored. We investigated the ability of Tat subtypes and variants to induce RSS activity and cell death. TatB, from HIV-1 subtype B, was found to be a potent RSS activator by 40% whereas TatC, from HIV-1 subtype C, showed 15% RSS activity while subtype TatC variants exhibited varying levels. A high level of cell death (50-53%) was induced by subtype TatB when compared to subtype TatC (25-28%) and varying levels were observed with subtype TatC variants. These differential activities could be due to variations in the functional domains of Tat. These observations further our understanding of subtype-specific augmentation of Tat in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis.",

The negative control was un-transfected cells, the positive control (showing 80% GFP expression) was transfected cells with shRNA-luc and the RSS control (showing 50% silencing of GFP expression) was transfected cells with shRNA-GFP or shRNA-GFP+empty pCMV-Myc.

TatB, the representative Tat from subtype B; TatC, the representative Tat from subtype C; TatN12, a subtype C variant; TatD60, also a subtype C variant; and TatVT6, a B/C recombinant were used in this study. These variants showed more than 80% sequence similarity to subtype TatC. The unique mutations in these variants as compared to TatC are shown in the Figure 1A . The amino acid sequence comparisons between subtype TatB (pNL4-3) and TatC (93IN905) revealed 9 amino acid changes in almost all domains of Tat exon 1 sequence ( Figure 1A ). Tat protein expression was measured after 24 h of transfection on human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells with Tat variants and Tat subtypes by western blotting. The empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to measure the relative protein intensity. TatB protein was expressed higher (p < 0.005) than that of TatC. TatN12 and TatVT6 proteins were expressed similarly to TatC. TatD60 was expressed at a higher level than other TatC variants, namely TatN12 and TatVT6, and also higher (p < 0.005) than TatC ( Figure 1B ,C). All Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p < 0.0005) at the translational level which were normalized to the expression levels of control GAPDH and the relative protein intensity was calculated from the control pCMV-Myc vector. Tat RNA expression was measured after 24 h of transfection with Tat variants on HEK293T cells by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to measure the relative RNA intensity. All Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p < 0.0005) at the transcriptional level which were normalized to the expression levels of control beta-actin and the relative RNA intensity was calculated from the control plasmid Cytomegalovirus expressing an N-terminally Myc-tagged protein (pCMV-Myc) vector. We observed a less significant difference between TatB and TatC subtypes (p < 0.05), however there were no significant changes between TatC and Tat variants indicating that the genetic variations in Tat variants might not be affected at the RNA expressional levels ( Figure 1D ,E). These observed differences at the protein and RNA level with respect to subtypes and variants might be due to the amino acid variations found in Tat proteins. (TatN12 or TatVT6 or TatD60) or Tat subtypes (TatB or TatC) or empty pCMV-Myc vector on HEK293T cells (1 \u00b5g plasmid DNA/well in 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells), the RNA expression was monitored by Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The relative protein and RNA intensity of Tat variants was calculated by normalizing with the amount of beta-actin expressed in the corresponding Tat variants after deducing the expression of empty pCMV-Myc vector. The level of GAPDH was used as a loading control and the empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a negative control. Multiple-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by student t-test and are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. *** Highly significant (p < 0.0005), ** moderately significant (p < 0.005), * significant (p < 0.05), NS is non-significant.

Tat is reported to act as suppressor of RNAi by binding to DICER (RNA-specific endoribonucleases), thereby causing RNAi suppression [27, 52] . It has been demonstrated that Tat variants have been found to show widely varying potential for their ability to activate HIV-1 LTR promoter [1, 27, 53, 54] via TAR interactions [7] through hydrogen bonds [8] .

Tat variants were chosen based on the similarities in their genetic and functional activities. Before further investigation of control subtypes (TatB, TatC), our variants (TatN12, TatD60, and TatVT6) on RSS activity and cell death, we verified the expression levels of Tat at protein and RNA levels by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. We found TatB was better expressed at the protein level than TatC, which could be due to unique variation between these subtypes. TatVT6 was better expressed than TatC, perhaps due to the chimeric nature of TatVT6. TatB and the Tat variants showed similar levels of RNA expression, but TatC showed a slightly reduced level of RNA expression. The subtype specific variations in Tat gene would be responsible for the differences in protein production and RNA expression.",

This differential RSS activity might be due to the differential genetic signature pattern of subtypes; however, the protein expressions might also modulate the differential activities. We examined cell death by analyzing the DNA content of propidium-iodide treated cells using flow analysis and by cytochrome C release. Under identical conditions, TatC from an Indian isolate showed low levels of cell death when compared with those from subtype TatB. It is likely that reduced cell death mediated by HIV-1 TatC may result in a greater number of susceptible host cells for the virus in comparison to HIV-1 TatB infection. On other hand, Tat triggers high levels of cell death which may be critical for the virus at the end of the cell-cycle process to release virions from the human cells [21, 55] . TatB showed a higher level of cell death than TatC, which could be due to variation in the cysteine-rich and glutamine-rich regions that are known to mediate cell death. TatVT6, a B/C recombinant, showed higher cell death than TatC, but lower than TatB, which could be due to a cysteine-rich region from originating from TatB and the glutamine region from TatC. This study elucidates the importance of unique polymorphisms in Tat variants (TatN12 and TatD60), as well as subtype-specific variations in cysteine and glutamine regions of TatVT6 in causing varying levels of cell death and RSS activities.",

Since RSS activity and cell death are critical for viral fitness and pathogenesis, augmentation in these activities could greatly enhance HIV fitness. Subtype-specific differential activities mediated by Tat indicate that cell death may be differentially regulated by Tat subtypes to avoid premature death of an infected cell or to destroy the human cells after the release of virions. This study demonstrates how understanding subtype-specific Tat mutation will be necessary to elucidate HIV activities.",

The flow data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.3 software. In the plot, the x-axis represents FITC (GFP) and the y-axis represents SSC-H.
