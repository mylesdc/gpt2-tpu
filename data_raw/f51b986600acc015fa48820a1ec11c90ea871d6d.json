In WT mice, IFN-\u03b3 was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Mice with impaired IFN-\u03b3 signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8 + T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8 + tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8 + T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8 + T RM cell establishment.",

Previous studies have shown that mice with impaired IFN-\u03b3 signaling produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the CNS, resulting in better food intake and less weight loss than their WT counterparts, but entry of fewer antibody-secreting cells, slower clearance of infectious virus and more reactivation of infectious virus 18 to 21 days after infection [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the current study, we have further defined the role of IFN-\u03b3 by analyzing the in vitro role of IFN-\u03b3 in regulating SINV replication and clearance in differentiated neurons, identifying the sources of IFN-\u03b3 in the CNS of SINV-infected mice, and determining its role in clearance of SINV RNA and modulation of the T cell response. We show that IFN-\u03b3 induced an antiviral response in neurons in vitro with enhanced viral RNA clearance. In SINV-infected WT mice, IFN-\u03b3 was produced in the CNS by NK cells and T cells and inhibited development of the local CD8 + T cell response, resulting in slower clearance of viral RNA than in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 and Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Understanding how the immune response is able to clear both infectious virus and viral RNA while simultaneously controlling reactivation may inform development of interventions.",

Gbp2 ( Figure 2A ) and Irgm ( Figure 2B ), two genes associated with autophagy [25] , were highly expressed by SINV-infected dAP-7 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3, as were Oasl2 ( Figure 2C ), a member of the 2'-5'oligoadenylate/RNaseL system [26] , and Rsad2 ( Figure 2D ), which encodes viperin, a protein that interferes with assembly and release of many viruses [27] . Zc3hav1 ( Figure 2E ), which encodes ZAP/PARP13, a protein involved in viral RNA degradation and induction of the innate immune response that restricts alphavirus and flavivirus replication [28, 29] , was less highly upregulated. All of these genes required IFN-\u03b3 for induction and generally were not induced by SINV infection alone. ",

Most of the pathological changes seen with alphavirus encephalomyelitis are associated with infiltration of immune cells [14, 23, 24, [31] [32] [33] . Brains and spinal cords were examined for histopathological changes and inflammation at 0, 3, 5, and 7 DPI ( Figure 6 ). Sporadically at 5 DPI and consistently at 7 DPI, brains from WT mice had diffuse bilateral dilation of the lateral ventricles, extending along the dorsal aspects of the hippocampi. This change was rarely seen in brains from Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 or Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice, and when present, was less severe. Compared to mock-infected control mice ( Figure 6A ), both perivascular cuffing and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the parenchyma in the brain were present at 7 DPI in all SINV-infected mice ( Figure 6B ). In the spinal cord, compared to mock-infected controls ( Figure 6C ), SINV-infected WT and Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had more inflammation than Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6D ). For quantitative comparison of the inflammation in brain ( Figure 6E ) and spinal cord ( Figure 6F ) at 3, 5, and 7 DPI, a scoring system was used to evaluate coded H&E-stained sections [23, 24] . Inflammation steadily increased during the first week of infection, peaking at 7 DPI in WT and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice and at 5 DPI in Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In both tissues, inflammation scores were lower in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT or Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Minimal inflammation present in the brain but not spinal cord of mock-infected mice was likely due to trauma from the IC inoculation. ",

In the spinal cord, compared to mock-infected controls ( Figure 6C ), SINV-infected WT and Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had more inflammation than Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6D ). For quantitative comparison of the inflammation in brain ( Figure 6E ) and spinal cord ( Figure 6F ) at 3, 5, and 7 DPI, a scoring system was used to evaluate coded H&E-stained sections [23, 24] . Inflammation steadily increased during the first week of infection, peaking at 7 DPI in WT and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice and at 5 DPI in Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In both tissues, inflammation scores were lower in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT or Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Minimal inflammation present in the brain but not spinal cord of mock-infected mice was likely due to trauma from the IC inoculation. , and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 (white bars) mice either mock-infected or SINV-infected at 3, 5 or 7 DPI were scored for inflammation using a four-point (brain) or three-point (spinal cord) system (data are presented as the mean score \u00b1 SEM for 3-4 mice per strain per group; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01, Tukey's multiple comparisons test).",

As expected, IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 cells) was not produced by CD4 + T cells in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice, and the percentage of CD4 + T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 did not differ between WT and Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 8A ). The percentage of CD4 + T cells producing IL-4 (Th2 cells) was lower in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice than WT or Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 8B ). Although not significant, more CD4 + T cells in Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice produced IL-17a (Th17 cells) compared to WT and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 8C) , and the percentage of CD4 + T cells expressing both CD25 and Foxp3 (Tregs) trended lower in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 8D ). These results show that IFN-\u03b3 signaling affects CD4 + T cell function during SINV infection, but impaired signaling has only a modest effect on Th subset profile.",

At 7 DPI, mRNA expression of Il2 and Il10 was lower in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice, and expression of Il17a was higher in Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Il4 expression did not significantly differ among strains. Expression of mRNAs for transcription factors Tbx21 for Th1 cells (Figure 8I ), Gata3 for Th2 cells ( Figure 8J) , Rorc for Th17 cells (Figure 8K ), and Foxp3 for Tregs ( Figure 8L ) was also measured. While significant differences were found between strains at various time points, no major trends were identified. Therefore, CD4 + T cell differentiation mostly affected Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice with fewer Th2 and Treg cells and Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with more Th17 cells. Modulation of Th profiles during SINV infection by IFN-\u03b3 signaling warrants further examination. ",

Effect of IFN-\u03b3 Signaling on CD8 + T Cell and NK Cell Degranulation and Cytotoxic Function during SINV Infection CD8 + T cells and NK cells primarily exert their cytolytic effects through secretion of cytotoxic granzymes that kill target cells [34] . Because infiltration of CD8 + T cells and NK cells into the brain were differentially regulated by IFN-\u03b3 signaling, the extent of degranulation, as identified by CD107a expression [35] , and granzyme production were examined in cells from the CLNs and brains of WT, Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 , and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice at 7 DPI. In CLNs, CD107a expression by CD8 + T cells was minimally affected by IFN-\u03b3 signaling ( Figure 10A ). In brain, the percentage of CD8 + T cells expressing CD107a was higher in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice than WT mice, but absolute numbers were comparable ( Figure 10C ). In contrast, WT mice had more degranulated NK cells in the CLNs ( Figure 10B ) and the brain ( Figure 10D ) than either Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 or Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 signaling affected the cytotoxic function of local CNS NK cells and CD8 + T cells during SINV infection, but in opposite directions. ",

CD103 + TRM cells were assessed in CLNs and brains in WT, Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 , and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice at 7, 14, and 28 DPI to determine a role for IFN-\u03b3 in their development, maintenance, and survival ( Figure 11A ).

Higher percentages of CD4 + T cells in the brain were TRM cells, but they did not change over time or differ among mouse strains Granzymes A and B are the primary granzymes involved in cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells [36] , so we next identified the granzymes produced in the brain at 7 DPI during SINV infection and the effect of IFN-\u03b3 signaling using Boolean gating ( Figure 10E,F) . Approximately 35 to 40% of CD8 + T cells and 65 to 70% of NK cells in the brain produced both granzyme A and B. However, if producing only one granzyme, CD8 + T cells preferentially produced granzyme B, while NK cells preferentially produced granzyme A ( Figure 10F ). Additionally, granzyme production was lower in CD8 + T cells but higher in NK cells of WT mice compared to mice with impaired IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that IFN-\u03b3 promotes NK cell cytotoxicity but suppresses the cytotoxic potential of CD8 + T cells in the brain during SINV infection.",

The current study showed that mRNAs for Gbp2 and Irgm1 GTPase proteins associated with autophagy were highly induced by IFN-\u03b3 signaling in SINV-infected neurons as well as in the CNS of SINV-infected mice where multiple cells may be responding to secreted IFN-\u03b3. Autophagy can decrease virus replication by destroying virus or viral replication components, including alphaviruses, or by delivering them to endosomes for Toll-like receptor (TLR) induction of the innate immune response [39] [40] [41] . RNA viruses, including the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), target IRGM to promote virus replication [42, 43] . Another antiviral protein system highly induced by IFN-\u03b3 signaling during SINV infection of neurons was the 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, a pathway that affects replication of several neurotropic viruses, including rabies virus, canine distemper virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and JEV [29, [44] [45] [46] . Two other antiviral genes usually more robustly induced by type I than type II IFNs, Rsad2 and Zc3hav1, were induced later and to lesser extents. Rsad2-encoded viperin can impair budding of enveloped viruses [47] [48] [49] and alphavirus and flavivirus replication and assembly [50] [51] [52] [53] . Zc3hav1 encodes zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-13 (PARP13), an RNA-binding protein that recruits RNA decay factors to degrade viral RNA and inhibit viral RNA translation [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . However, the specific role for these ISGs in IFN-\u03b3-mediated virus clearance from neurons will require further study.",

Although IFN-\u03b3 is important for clearance of infectious virus, particularly from spinal cord neurons [7, 30] , and was sufficient for viral RNA clearance in neurons in vitro, IFN-\u03b3 delayed clearance initiation of viral RNA from both the brain and spinal cord in mice ( Figure 5 ), suggesting an extra neuronal effect that secondarily affects viral RNA clearance. IFN-\u03b3 signaling improved recruitment of NK cells but differentially affected the recruitment of T cells, with more CD4 + T cells and fewer CD8 + T cells infiltrating the brains of SINV-infected WT mice than Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 or Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice. This modification of the local T cell response potentially explains the differential initiation of RNA clearance among mice with intact and impaired IFN-\u03b3 signaling, leading us to further evaluate the composition and functionality of these T cells.",

Th17 cells have been associated with fatal encephalomyelitis and virus persistence during infection with several viruses, such as SINV NSV, TMEV, and JHMV, especially in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 [12, [60] [61] [62] . Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice expressed more Il17a mRNA and trended toward increased IL-17a production by CD4 + T cells compared to WT and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice. Similar results were seen in Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SINV NSV and suggest preferential expansion of Th17 cells [30] . Neutrophils, also associated with a Th17 profile [63] , were also increased in brains of Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.

As with NK cells, CD8 + T cells primarily exert their effector function against virus infections through cytotoxic activity and produce granzymes and perforin for delivery through granule exocytosis to activate caspases and induce target cell apoptosis [34] . A clear role for NK cells in pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis has not been identified [65, 66] and, in the current studies, greater numbers of NK cells and granzyme A expression in WT mice did not offset the diminished CD8 + T cell response. Specific targeting of infected cells by CD8 + T cells is achieved through direct contact with an infected cell expressing MHC Class I molecules. Neurons have a limited capacity for MHC class I expression [2, [67] [68] [69] [70] , but CD8 + T cells can directly engage virus-infected neurons [71] , and clearance of WNV, JEV, and LCMV from the CNS is dependent on the granzyme/perforin pathway [72] [73] [74] . Perforin production is decreased in the brains of WT mice compared to Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice during SINV NSV infection [30] , and perforin-mediated effector function is impaired during JHMV infection [75] However, IFN-\u03b3 promotes granzyme B production during experimental coronavirus retinopathy [76] . Therefore, the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the granule exocytosis pathway during CNS infection appears to be virus-specific, and the mechanisms by which IFN-\u03b3 influences granzyme production during SINV infection remain to be understood.",

For instance, CD8 + T cells can inhibit reactivation of HSV-1 in neurons via a non-cytolytic mechanism [80] [81] [82] . Mouse granzyme K induces macrophages to release IL-1\u03b2 during LCMV infection [83] , and granzyme substrates with direct antiviral activity, either viral proteins or host cell proteins essential for virus replication, have also been identified. Granzymes A, H, and M cleave viral proteins important for replication of Moloney mouse leukemia virus, adenovirus, and human cytomegalovirus [84] [85] [86] . Granzymes B and H both cleave the RNA-binding protein La, which is important in viral RNA metabolism for several viruses [87] [88] [89] [90] . hnRNP K, which modulates viral RNA replication of CHIKV, enterovirus 71, dengue virus, and HIV-1 [91] [92] [93] [94] and interacts with SINV nsp2 and subgenomic mRNA [95, 96] , is a substrate for granzyme B. Silencing of hnRNP K or disruption of hnRNP-vRNA binding decreases SINV RNA replication in vitro [96, 97] . Therefore, we postulate that the increased granzyme B produced by CD8 + T cells of Ifngr1 \u2212/\u2212 and Ifng \u2212/\u2212 cleaves one or more cellular proteins important for SINV RNA replication or stability to accelerate noncytotoxic viral RNA clearance from the brain and spinal cord.

Indeed, during Phase 3 of infection, transient increases in viral RNA were seen in SINV-infected mice, particularly in Ifng \u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, prevention of virus reactivation is likely achieved through continued presence of immune cells at the previous site of infection [103, 104] . Over the course of infection, the percentage of CD8 + , but not CD4 + , T cells expressing CD103, a marker for T RM cells in the brain, increased. As permanent residents at sites of previous infection, T RM cells provide a rapid response to pathogen reactivation [105] [106] [107] . IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD4 + T cells is required for generating CD8 + T RM cells in the lung after influenza virus infection [108] , and rapid clearance of LCMV by brain T RM cells depends on IFN-\u03b3 signaling and cytotoxic granule release [107] . Brains of SINV-infected mice defective in IFN-\u03b3 signaling had both fewer CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T RM cells than WT mice, indicating a need for IFN-\u03b3 to promote the residence of T RM cells in the brain after infection.",

IFN-\u03b3 facilitates infectious virus clearance through direct antiviral effects on infected neurons and inducing production of B cell-attracting chemokines that fosters local production of anti-SINV antibody [9] . However, IFN-\u03b3 impairs viral RNA clearance, possibly by suppressing the CD8 + T cell response in the CNS and granzyme B production. Finally, IFN-\u03b3 promotes the development of CD8 + T RM cells in the brain, likely helping prevent reactivation of persistent virus. Better understanding of the complicated interplay between the virus and host immune system in inducing pathology and promoting virus clearance is critical to developing effective therapies.",
