Despite recent progress in analysing and modelling EBOV epidemiological data, a complete characterization of the spatiotemporal spread of Ebola cases remains a challenge. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the EBOV epidemic in Sierra Leone that uses individual virus genome sequences to inform population-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages of virus genomes, these spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV in Sierra Leone without the need for human mobility data. Consistent with other investigations, our results show that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our phylodynamic analysis also revealed a change in model preference towards a spatial model with power-law characteristics in the latter portion of the epidemic, correlated with the timing of major intervention campaigns. More generally, we believe this framework, pairing molecular diagnostics with a dynamic model selection procedure, has the potential to be a powerful forecasting tool along with offering operationally relevant guidance for surveillance and sampling strategies during an epidemic.",

            "text": "Arresting the West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic of 2013-2016 required a significant international intervention and exposed a global vulnerability to emerging epidemics. Advances in genetic-sequencing technologies have enabled the near real-time analysis of infectious pathogen genomes [1] [2] [3] , thereby improving forecasts for emerging epidemics [4, 5] , enhancing surveillance of endemic diseases [6] and identifying strategies for eradication [7, 8] . During the West African EBOV crisis, publicly available data facilitated a series of prominent analyses aimed at identifying basic epidemiological parameters, i.e. the reproductive number [9, 10] . Further, the release of EBOV genome data, coupled with phylogenetic methods, provided fundamental insight into the origin and spatial properties of the epidemic [11, 12] . Despite the prominent role mathematical and statistical modelling played during the epidemic, there has been a significant delay in characterizing the spatiotemporal spread of EBOV. For future epidemics, the design of operationally relevant, spatially distributed interventions requires the identification of predictive models that are able to assimilate case and genetic data. In this article, we describe how EBOV molecular data, specifically virus genomes, can be used to directly model the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Sierra Leone epidemic.",

Transmission of EBOV within Sierra Leone was almost completely within its borders [36] , which provided a constrained and representative dataset to investigate the utility of virus genomes to construct population-level spatial models. Paired with advances in phylogenetics that identify linkages between cases [8] , EBOV genome data offer powerful insight into spatiotemporal, transmission events. These genomic linkages, in combination with geographical and demographical characteristics included in our framework, help infer the parameters of gravity and L\u00e9vy flight models. We focus on identifying data-driven, spatial models that are interpretable and consistent with established patterns of human population movement. Adaptive model selection during the course of the epidemic reveals a significant change in virus mobility in Sierra Leone: dependence on population size decreases towards the end of the epidemic. For future epidemics, we believe that this framework could be implemented to improve forecasting efforts and help design efficient intervention campaigns that adapt to real-time phylodynamics.",

The POTN algorithm computes a likelihood ratio based on a Poisson model of the mutation rate to identify genomes that are most likely to be direct relatives. This contrasts with widely used phylogenetic analyses that infer common ancestors, such as Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) [41] . The POTN algorithm produces a pairwise, time-directed network of ancestor and descendant genomes, linked by the relative change in their sequences between collection dates. For EBOV, we used an average nucleotide substitution rate of 2 \u00c2 10 23 bp/site/yr, a value measured during the 2013-2016 epidemic; see Fig. 4F of [11] . A false discovery rate for each linkage is computed with a single degree-offreedom x 2 test, with a cut-off at p \u00bc 0.05. Figure 1b shows a visualization of the EBOV POTN for Sierra Leone pruned to the shortest generation time for each ancestor.

Of these, 355 have a unique descendant and 670 have fewer than three likely descendants. The POTN algorithm is designed to return several possible descendants associated with the same ancestor when these are supported by the data. See electronic supplementary material, figure S2A for the empirical distribution of all linkage durations. For illustrative purposes, figure 1b shows the POTN pruned to include only the shortest linkage duration from each ancestor. The median linkage time from the POTN is 31 days. Based on an EBOV serial interval of 15 days [47] , this implies approximately one unobserved transmission event per linkage. The median linkage duration is reduced to 11 days if the POTN is pruned to the shortest generation times, illustrated in electronic supplementary material, figure S2B . The likelihood ratio and MLE calculations include all likely descendants associated with a single ancestor. However, for the adaptive model selection procedure, descendants outside of each time interval are excluded. For example, figure 1f illustrates the likelihood ratio for 50 day intervals. Despite the challenges associated with partially observed transmission chains, we find that our subsequent analyses of spatial model calibration and model selection are robust to a wide variety of linkage exclusion criteria, such as restricting the maximum allowable linkage duration. See electronic supplementary material, figure S3 for more details. Our results are also robust when considering longer time intervals. We define three sequential stages for the epidemic: Stage I (0-150 days), Stage II (150-300 days) and Stage III (300-550 days). The geographical distribution of linked cases across districts for the three stages shows that the number of genomes sequenced is proportional to the number of confirmed cases [40] , except when the number of confirmed cases is larger than 1000 (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ).",

Data, gathered from case-contact tracing and molecular diagnostics, can identify individual transmission events that inform population-level models of disease spread. For example, analyses of recent epidemics, including EBOV outbreak in West Africa [31, 33, 48] , the SARS outbreak in 2003 [49] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in 2012 [50] , each used detailed individual-level data to infer epidemic parameters and factors influencing large-scale dynamics. Despite the encouraging progress of mathematical modelling and statistical analyses for the 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic [10, 33, 51, 52] , the characterization and spatial modelling of the outbreak is incomplete. The ability to rapidly quantify spatiotemporal spread during an epidemic would allow for near real-time forecasts and the design of operationally relevant, spatially targeted interventions. The primary contribution of this work is the development of an adaptive framework for analysing epidemics that incorporates detailed transmission information from linked virus genomes to characterize interpretable, population-level spatial models. Recent advances in phylogenetic reconstruction of transmission networks promise accurate and actionable models of epidemic dynamics [4,27 -29,53,54] . Here, we chose the POTN method [8] as an efficient and direct likelihoodbased tool to link EBOV cases in space and time. These high-fidelity, space-time couplings between individual cases allowed the parametrization of spatial models describing disease mobility, without the need for proxy human mobility data. This framework offers a principled and extensible methodology for investigating the relevant factors for disease mobility.",

For this study, we posited two parsimonious models, well known in the epidemiology and ecology literature, to investigate the influence of population and distance on the spatial spread of cases. We discovered that the stochastic propagation of cases is best described by a probabilistic gravity model where dependence on the population and distance varies over the course of the epidemic. The gravity model was preferred in the early part of the epidemic when EBOV was circulating near cities in the east of Sierra Leone. Once the virus migrated to more densely populated areas of the capital area, such as Freetown, Kenema and Port Loko, the gravity model preference became much stronger. During this portion of the epidemic, the transmission events were highly local with a large proportion of linkages staying between large population centres. This observation is also consistent with recent studies of the superspreader phenomenon in the Western Area [52, 56] .",

            "text": "The probabilistic gravity model can be considered a generalization of a random walk process, weighted by country-specific population distributions. This population influence changed over the course of the EBOV epidemic. In fact, after March 2015, the population dependence diminished significantly. This suggests that EBOV mobility in the last stage of the epidemic can be accurately modelled as a spatial process dependent solely on distance. The MLE of the parameters for the gravity model showed a large uncertainty in the population exponent t 2 . Further, the distance exponent was r , 1, indicating a higher probability of larger distances between linked cases. In the pure power-law model, the disease mobility during this period has a L\u00e9vy flight exponent of order a \u00bc r 2 1 \u00bc 0.6, suggesting a space-fractional diffusion process. This result is consistent with the observation that confirmed EBOV cases decreased in the large cities of the Western Area rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 14: 20170583 and appeared sporadically in less populated areas far from the Western Area after March 2015. Further, this shift away from a strong preference for a gravity model coincided with an intervention campaign by the government of Sierra Leone called Operation Western Area Surge (OWAS) that occurred on 17 December 2014 [57] . Sociological observations, after the OWAS, described an increase in health centre avoidance, return trips to home villages and transmission away from population centres [58] . These results highlight the importance of continual collection of genomic data for characterizing the change in dynamic behaviour along with evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.",

Despite the EBOV data spanning the entire country and nearly the full time course of the epidemic, the collection of virus genomes was not part of a unified programme. Moreover, the metadata for each sequence, i.e. the global positioning system location and demographical information, are not completely resolved. Uncertainty in reporting due to collection and laboratory processing introduces delays that could impact the utility of predictive spatial models. Our model selection also currently consists of two classes of spatial models: gravity and L\u00e9vy flight. We expect to expand our framework to a wider variety of models, but are aware of the challenge in finding parsimonious descriptions of human mobility [59] . As a retrospective study, we have analysed the robustness of our methodology to uncertainties, but inherent difficulties in data collection and modelling will challenge real-time deployment of this tool.",

(a) The time course is shown for the number of confirmed cases[40] and sequenced EBOV genomes[33]. Three stages of the epidemic are highlighted.(b) Genetic linkages are illustrated with ancestors (open circles) and descendants (closed dots), both coloured by the origin district shown in the map key. The blue arrow highlights a linkage from the Western Urban to Kenema districts. (c) Chiefdom populations (greyscale) and major roads (yellow traces) are illustrated on the map of Sierra Leone. The blue arrow highlights the fastest driving route between the Western Urban to Kenema district. (d) All transmission distances are shown in a cCDF. The distribution of transmission distances are fit by a power law with r \u00bc 1.66. The blue arrow follows the linkage from (b) and (c). (e) Two spatial models are plotted as maps representing the probability of observing a new case linked to the Western Urban district, using (r w \u00bc 1, t w 2 \u00bc 1) for the gravity model and r \u00bc 1.66 for the power law. (f ) The log-likelihood ratio, R, comparing the gravity and power-law models, is plotted for 50-day windows. The dashed black line represents (r \u00bc 1.66, t 2 \u00bc 1) fixed in time; the solid black line of R uses the MLE (r w (t), t w 2 (t)), computed for each window. The solid red trace describes the number of linkages. rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 14: 20170583",

Most of the linkages occurred in these larger population chiefdoms in the eastern province of Sierra Leone, illustrated on the map of figure 3a.
