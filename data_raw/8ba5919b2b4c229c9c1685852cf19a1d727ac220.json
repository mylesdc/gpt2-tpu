We explored an alternative approach that entailed genetically modifying a pathogen with broad host specificity so that it no longer caused disease, but carried a gene to disrupt the cane toad life cycle in a species specific manner.",

A previous report showed injection of bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs as well as reduced survival. In B. marinus we established for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin exists. The effect of injecting B. marinus tadpoles with purified recombinant adult globin protein was then assessed using behavioural (swim speed in tadpoles and jump length in metamorphs), developmental (time to metamorphosis, weight and length at various developmental stages, protein profile of adult globin) and genetic (adult globin mRNA levels) measures. However, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals. Further, globin delivery using Bohle iridovirus, an Australian ranavirus isolate belonging to the Iridovirus family, did not reduce the survival of metamorphs or alter the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs.",

Cane toads are now present throughout most of tropical northern Australia and their range is continuing to expand into world heritage areas. Predicted warming due to climate change could extend the range of the cane toad south into what are currently temperate regions [1] . The cane toad is a highly toxic and hardy introduced species and presents wide ranging ecological and social impacts within the Australian landscape. Native species such as quolls, goannas and native frogs are particularly susceptible to the cane toad toxin and many populations have been severely impacted by the arrival of cane toads [2, 3, 4] .",

Metamorphosis is characterised by rapid and extensive morphological changes [12, 13] , accompanied by strong shifts in the expression of genes and proteins at the molecular level [14, 15] . Cane toad genes that are expressed in metamorphs but not in tadpoles therefore represent ideal targets to block and thus manipulate aspects of development. One documented example of the transition from a larval to an adult form in amphibians is haemoglobin [16] and we have used microarray analysis to establish that adult haemoglobin is significantly upregulated during cane toad metamorphosis [17] . Injecting tadpoles with adult globin interfered with expression of this protein in Rana catesbeiana, and induced changes in gene expression profiles of metamorphs [18] . Thus we hypothesise that it may be possible to alter metamorphosis by immunologically sensitising larval stages (tadpoles) to proteins expressed only in later post-metamorphic stages. Adult globin is not a cane toad specific gene; we used it here to determine whether autoimmunity might affect the protein profile of metamorphs. If successful, the concept would be extended to cane toad specific genes that were upregulated at metamorphosis.",

Our results indicate that the altered adult globin protein profile seen in Rana catesbeiana metamorphs after exposure of tadpoles to adult globin does not occur in B.marinus.

The fragments were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pDEST17 and expressed as His 6 -tagged proteins in E. coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown overnight (37uC) in LB supplemented with antibiotics, then diluted 100-fold and grown to an OD of 0.6 (600 nm). L-arabinose (Sigma) was added (0.2% final conc.) to induce protein production and incubation continued for 3-5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl; pH 7.5), disrupted by freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged at 10,0006 g for 30 min. The pellet was solubilised in TBS containing 8 M Urea for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,0006 g for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. His 6 -tagged proteins were purified in the denatured state using Ni 2+ NTA agarose (Qiagen), washed via imidazole-containing steps (TBS+20, 30 or 40 mM imidazol) and eluted in TBS+500 mM imidazole. Size-based secondary purification was then achieved by continuous-elution electrophoresis (Model 491 Prep Cell, Bio-Rad). Globin proteins were dialysed against amphibian Ringers solution [4.89 g NaCl, 0.298 g KCl, 0.265 g CaCl 2 .2H 2 0, 0.197 g MgSO 4 .7H 2 0, 1.495 g NaHCO 3 , 0.127 g NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O and 1.982 g glucose per litre dH 2 O] overnight at 4uC and concentrations determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (15% gels) using the Bio-Rad Protean II System and visualised with Coomassie brilliant blue. Purified recombinant globin proteins were used as immunogens for the generation of rabbit antiserum. Briefly, two rabbits per immunogen were injected 10 days apart with vaccine containing 50 mg of either adult (rAdglob) or tadpole (rTadglob) recombinant globin. Two weeks later a third dose was administered if a boost to the antibody response was required. Each dose was prepared in CSIRO triple adjuvant (60% v/v Montanide; 40%, v/v rHb [combined with Quil A, 3 mg/mL, and DEAE-dextran, 30 mg/mL]), in water.",

We have previously demonstrated strong upregulation of adult globin genes during cane toad metamorphosis and that this was more pronounced than for any of the other genes induced at metamorphosis [17] . We have also previously shown that the recombinant BIV can be genetically modified to express adult globin in vitro [11] and confirmed here that this virus (rBIV/neo r /Adglob) is capable of infecting cane toad tadpoles. We therefore used rBIV/neo r /Adglob to assess the effect of viral delivery of an adult specific gene or protein to tadpoles on subsequent metamorphosis, and compared this to the effects of immunisation with purified protein and adjuvants.",

Firstly, the cane toad has a very short larval stage of approximately 50-60+days, depending on tadpole density and temperature [28] whereas the larval stage in the bullfrog lasts at least 120 days and up to 2 years depending on environmental conditions [29] . The long larval stage in the bullfrog enabled an initial immunisation using FCA, followed by a boost 1 month later [18] . By contrast, cane toad tadpoles in our study were only large enough to be first injected at stage 26 (approximately day 9), barely 3 weeks before the onset of adult globin synthesis at stages 36-40 (day 30-43) and so a similar boost was not given. Nevertheless we considered that there should be sufficient time for a primary immune response to develop before adult globin appeared, provided cane toad tadpoles recognise the adult globin as a foreign protein. Secondly, due to the large difference between the cane toad and bullfrog developmental time frames, and as age at inoculation was not specified, the bullfrog tadpoles may have been inoculated later in development and been more immunocompetent than in our study. In support of this, studies in Xenopus have demonstrated that immune responses improve with age. The affinity of specific IgY antibodies against dinitrophenol (DNP) in Xenopus larvae is reported to be less than in adults, and in turn much lower than the affinity of mammalian anti-DNP IgG antibodies [30, 31] . The range of antibodies produced to DNP were also less heterogeneous in larval than in adult Xenopus [32] .",

In mammals the antiviral response relies on cytotoxic T lymphocytes and these are Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC class I) restricted. Larval Xenopus reportedly lack MHC classical class I expression [33] suggesting the antiviral response in larvae may be compromised. Studies of the adaptive immune response in Xenopus adults and larvae to frog virus 3 (FV-3), the type virus of the ranavirus genus, indicate this may be so. While adult Xenopus cleared an initial infection and showed an accelerated response to a second injection, tadpoles were much more susceptible, suffering a high mortality rate and a reduced ability to clear the infection compared with infected adults [34] . In spite of lacking MHC class I, tadpoles do have CD8 T cells [35] and so the role played by the lack of MHC class I in the poor antiviral response is unknown. While most of these studies have been carried out in Xenopus, limited studies indicate bullfrogs are capable of mounting a detectable antibody response to an antigen, but apparently not to influenza virus despite repeated inoculations and a substantial and anamnestic response to bacteriophage T7 [36] . Our own studies indicate that B. marinus tadpoles did not mount a detectable antibody response to a widely used and well characterised immunogen, ovalbumin, to which adult B. marinus did respond.",

Given the short larval phase in the B. marinus life cycle, antigens produced later than globin may be more effective immunogens and we are currently investigating this possibility. It is also possible that this approach would be more successful in an amphibian with a longer larval phase. Finally, we have designed, developed and delivered a recombinant viral system that will enable the development of future strategies to prevent the spread of the toad.",
