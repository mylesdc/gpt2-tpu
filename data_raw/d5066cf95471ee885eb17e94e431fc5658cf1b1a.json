            "text": "Against a backdrop of seasonal influenza virus epidemics, emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) occasionally jump from birds to humans, posing a public health risk, especially with the recent sharp increase in H7N9 infections. Evaluations of cross-reactive T-cell immunity to seasonal influenza viruses and humaninfecting AIVs have been reported previously. However, the roles of influenza A virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive T-cell responses and heterosubtypic protections are not well understood; understanding those roles is important for preventing and controlling new emerging AIVs. Here, among the members of a healthy population presumed to have previously been infected by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), we found that pH1N1-specific T cells showed cross-but biased reactivity to humaninfecting AIVs, i.e., H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2, which correlates with distinct protections. Through a T-cell epitope-based phylogenetic analysis, the cellular immunogenic clustering expanded the relevant conclusions to a broader range of virus strains. We defined the potential key conserved epitopes required for cross-protection and revealed the molecular basis for the immunogenic variations. Our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to AIVs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development. IMPORTANCE We revealed preexisting but biased T-cell reactivity of pH1N1 influenza virus to human-infecting AIVs, which provided distinct protections. The crossreactive T-cell recognition had a regular pattern that depended on the T-cell epitope matrix revealed via bioinformatics analysis. Our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to AIVs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development.",

Humoral immunogenic sites on the HA protein of influenza A virus are mainly distributed over five conformational sites (Fig. 1D) , including four humoral antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca, and Cb) on the HA \"head\" and a subdominant B-cell epitope on the HA \"stem.\" Structure-based conservancy analysis of these epitopes revealed that the four antigenic sites on the HA head of the four AIVs A(H5N1)/Vietnam/1194/2004, A(H6N1)/ Taiwan/2/2013, A(H7N9)/Anhui/1/2013, and A(H9N2)/Hong Kong/1073/99 were distinct from those of A(H1N1)/California/04.

Different clusters of AIV HAs were generated. Though H1 and H5 are adjacent to each other in phylogeny, there was no cross-reactive serological reactivity to H5N1 among the putative pH1N1-infected population. Thus, the results are consistent with respect to comparisons between the divergent B cell epitopes on the humoral HA antigens of different AIVs and the phenomenon that no cross-reactive antibody titers were observed between the tested AIVs and pH1N1.",

To investigate potential preexisting T-cell responses to different AIVs among the pH1N1-infected subjects, we stimulated freshly isolated PBMCs from the pH1N1 Ab \u03e9 cohort via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay with live influenza viruses as stimulators. We found that certain levels of cross-reactive T-cell responses against H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses were detected. Cross-reactive T-cell responses against H5N1 (36.8 spot-forming cells [SFCs]/ 10 5 PBMCs) were found at levels similar to those determined for pH1N1-specific T-cell responses (34.9 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs), but the levels for both were higher than those seen with other AIVs, i.e., H6N1 (15.1 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs), H7N9 (16 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs), and H9N2 (17.7 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs) ( Fig. 2A) . Lee et al. synthesized the overlapping peptides covering all proteins and found that M1 and NP possess the major immunogenic sites (20) . We evaluated cross-reactive T-cell responses to M1 proteins from different AIVs among the pH1N1 M1-cultured PBMCs for 9 days. Though cross-T-cell reactivity was observed for all four tested AIVs, the cross-reactivity to M1 of H5N1 (497 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs) shown by the pH1N1-specific T cells was higher than that to other AIVs (for H6N1, 404 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs; for H7N9, 359 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs) (Fig. 2B ). In intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays, both the cross-CD8 \u03e9 T cells (4.37% gamma interferon positive [IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 ] CD8 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 ) and CD4 \u03e9 T cells (0.27% IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 ) displayed a bias with respect to H5N1; in contrast, H7N9 presented the lowest cross-T-cell reactivity level, with 1.08% IFN-\u2425-secreting cells in CD8 \u03e9 T cells and 0.14% IFN-\u2425secreting cells in CD4 \u03e9 T cells (Fig. 2C to F), while the T-cell responses of pH1N1antibody negative individuals did not show such differences in statistics (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material).",

Thus, to investigate the contribution of different cellular antigens of influenza viruses to biased cross-T-cell reactivities, we compared T-cell responses to H7N9 and pH1N1 among the members of the healthy population using overlapping peptides covering the M1 and NP proteins. We found that T-cell reactivity to H7N9 NP was of the same level as the T-cell reactivity to pH1N1 NP as detected in the PBMCs ex vivo by ELISPOT assay (Fig. 2I ). Subsequently, we established H7N9-and pH1N1-specific T-cell lines in vitro by stimulating the PBMCs with an NP peptide pool for 9 days. The responses to NPs of either H7N9 (354 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs) or pH1N1 (398 SFCs/10 5 PBMCs) of the T-cell lines remained at the same level (Fig. 2J) .

To better investigate the correlation of the internal proteins and T-cell cross-reactivities, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the predominant influenza virus T-cell immunogens, i.e., M1, NP, and PB1, based on the full-length protein sequences ( Fig. 4A and C and E). We found that the HA relationship of the AIVs did not reflect the biased cross-T-cell reactivities. The M1 protein from different H5N1 strains and that from pH1N1 were not very clearly closely related to each other, and neither were NP and PB1. Cross-reactive T cells targeted different CD8 \u03e9 or CD4 \u03e9 T-cell epitopes of AIVs covering special sequences of the antigens. Thus, we hypothesized that the phylogenetic relationship in terms of the T-cell epitopes from different AIVs may correspond to the biased cross-T-cell reactivities. We retrieved the previously defined HLA class I-restricted peptides located within the internal M1, NP, and PB1 proteins of pH1N1 and the corresponding peptides within different AIVs and plotted their phylogenetic relationship ( Fig. 4B and D and F) . The T-cell epitope evolution of pH1N1 is close to that of H5N1 but distant from those of H7N9, H9N2, and H6N1, which is consistent with the biased cross-T-cell reactivity to H5N1 but not to the other strains.",

We analyzed 38 representative human-infecting AIV strains as well as the recent seasonal H1N1 stains. A total of 266 CTL epitopes were retrieved from IEDB and then mapped to each strain (up to 30 December 2016). We filtered out 129 internal protein epitopes to perform further analysis (see Table S2 ). Clustering analysis indicated that the H1N1 stains are located in one cluster (see Fig. S3A ). For different humaninfecting AIV strains, H5N1 strains remained close to pH1N1 compared to the distance of other AIVs (i.e., H7N9, H6N1, H9N2) to pH1N1 (Fig. 4G) . The H7N9 and H9N2 strains were intermixed with each other, which may have been related to the shared internal genes of these AIV subtypes in China (5) . Seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses before 2009, such as A(H1N1)/Brisbane/59/07, were located in a cluster that was adjacent to but distinct from that of pH1N1, indicating a cellular antigenic transition of pH1N1 compared to previous H1N1 stains.

The overall conformations of main chains were similar in the two structures ( Fig. 5D and E) . However, in the HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 structure, residue Ile9 inserts inside the E pocket of the HLA-A*2402 groove (Fig. 5F ). In contrast, in the HLA-A*2402/H7-25 complex, mutated residue Met9 is too large to be accommodated in the E pocket of HLA-A*2402 and, thus, its side chain protrudes from the peptide binding groove and might be contacted by the TCR (Fig. 5G) . Another structural variation is contributed by Lys4. Although this residue is conserved between the P25 peptides of pH1N1 and H7N9, the salt bridge formed between Lys4 and Glu8 in HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 is not present in the structure of HLA-A*2402/H7-P25. Without the constraint of the salt bridge, Lys4 of peptide H7-P25 in HLA-A*2402/H7-P25 is exposed to solvent instead of being partially buried in the C pocket as in the HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 structure. Due to the low resolution (3.3 \u00c5) of the first data set from HLA-A*2402/H7-P25, we collected another data set which had higher resolution (2.3 \u00c5) (see Table S4 ). Though no clear electron density for residues in the middle portion of H7-25 was observable on the basis of data set 2 of HLA-A*2402/H7-P25, the conformations of residues Lys4 and Met9 from H7-P25 in data set 2 were still different from those from H1-P25 but were similar to those from H7-P25 in data set 1 (see Fig. S1B ).",

Considering the unequal cross-reactivities to different AIVs exhibited by pH1N1-specific T cells, especially with respect to the difference between H5N1 and H7N9, the next issue that we addressed was whether these T-cell immunogenicity variations can lead to different heterosubtypic protections against these AIVs. We used pH1N1 virus at sublethal doses to prime mice, and 28 days later, the mice were intranasally infected with lethal doses of pH1N1, H5N1, or H7N9. For homologous challenge of pH1N1, the protection ratio was 100% (Fig. 6A) . The rate of heterosubtypic protection against H5N1 challenge was also 100% (Fig. 6D ), but the rate of protection against H7N9 challenge was 89% (Fig. 6G) . The mice in the homologous pH1N1 challenge group (Fig. 6B ) and the pH1N1 primed-H5N1 challenge group (Fig. 6E ) N and O) pH1N1-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells of pH1N1-primed mice were stained with tetramers H1-NP 366\u03ea374 (complex between H-2D b and peptide from H1N1), H5/H7-NP 366\u03ea374 (complex between H-2Db and peptide from H5N1/H7N9), H1-PA 224\u03ea233 (complex between H-2D b and peptide from H1N1), and H1-PA 224\u03ea233 (complex between H-2D b and peptide from H5N1/H7N9). CD8 \u03e9 T cells were subsequently selected for the analysis of tetramers (n \u03ed 4). Differences between two groups were compared using Student's t test (J to L and N), and differences among multiple groups were compared using ANOVA (M). *, P \u03fd 0.05. displayed no or minor body weight losses, while the mice in the pH1N1 primed-H7N9 challenge group (Fig. 6H ) had a body weight loss of \u03fe10% in the first 7 days after H7N9 challenge. Concerning virus shedding in the lungs after infection, no virus was detected by 3 days postinfection (d.p.i.) or afterward for the homologous challenge of pH1N1 (Fig. 6C) . As for the pH1N1-primed H5N1 group (Fig. 6F) , the H5N1 virus load was much lower than that seen with the unprimed group by 3 dpi and disappeared by 7 dpi.

In the pH1N1-infected group, pH1N1-specific neutralizing antibodies were detectable on day 14, and no cross-neutralization antibody titers to H5N1 or H7N9 could be detected (Fig. 6J) and similarly, there was no cross-neutralization antibody titers to pH1N1 detected in serum of the H5N1-or H7N9-infected group (Fig. 6K and L) . The pH1N1-specific T-cell response in the mice was found to be 363 SFCs/10 6 splenocytes at 14 dpi with pH1N1 (Fig. 6M ). Meanwhile, cross-reactive T-cell responses to either H5N1 or H7N9 were found in the pH1N1-infected mice. However, the cross-reactive T-cell responses to H7N9 (273 SFCs/10 6 splenocytes) were lower than those against H5N1 (361 SFCs/10 6 splenocytes). These results indicated that bias of cross-reactive T-cell responses induced by pH1N1 may lead to different protection efficacies against H5N1 and H7N9. We also prepared the tetramers of two immunodominant H-2D brestricted T-cell epitopes, NP 366 -374 and PA 224\u03ea233 , and their H5N1/H7N9 mutants. The tetramer staining of the splenocytes from the mice infected by H1N1 for 28 days showed that the mice possessed robust H1-NP 366\u03ea374 and H1-PA 224\u03ea233 peptidespecific CD8 \u03e9 T cells (1.2% and 0.9%), whereas certain T cells cross-recognizing the H5N1/H7N9 mutants could also be detected (0.31% and 0.40%) (Fig. 6N and O) . However, the ratios of mutant peptides H5/H7-NP 366\u03ea374 and H1/H7-PA 224\u03ea233 were lower, which may still have contributed to the cross-protection.",

The elicitation of a neutralizing-antibody response is a correlate of protection for vaccines and contributes to protection against many viral infections (33). In particular, HA imprinting in childhood could provide lifelong protection against severe infection and death from emergent viruses (34) . However, a previous study showed that no H7N9specific antibody titers were detected in the 1,544 serum samples collected before the emergence of H7N9 from poultry workers, most of whom were born after 1968, when H3N2 emerged (18) . This indicated that cross-reactive serological immunity against H7N9 virus did not preexist among healthy young populations. In our study, the levels of neutralizing antibodies that cross-recognized H5N1 and H7N9 were also undetectable, which may indicate a critical role of T cells in heterosubtypic protection. Recent studies indicated that HA-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells do not possess a dominant role compared to the internal proteins such as M1 and NP (20, 35) . Therefore, HA-specific immunity may not be sufficient to explain the cross-protection against AIV by the immunity to previous seasonal influenza viruses. According to our bioinformatics analyses, the heat map of all available T-cell epitopes among human-infecting viruses indicated that the accumulation of varied epitopes may hinder cross-T-cell reactivities.",

In contrast, T-cell recognition of the mutant viral epitopes in H7N9 was significantly decreased due to the poor T-cell activation threshold and disrupted peptide-HLA interactions.

            "text": "Although there have been hundreds of influenza virus-specific epitopes identified across proteins using a range of epitope identification techniques, the majority of the conserved epitopes are derived from the internal proteins M1, NP, and PB1 (37) (38) (39) . Lee and others reported that M1 and NP possess the major immunogenicities among the internal proteins, followed by PB1 and PA (20) . They also found that the recognition frequency of M1 protein was higher than those of the other internal proteins. However, the identity of the internal proteins which possess a dominant influence on T-cell cross-reactivity was still unknown. On the basis of previous researches, we compared the T-cell responses against H1N1 and H7N9 among healthy donors with overlapping peptide pools of NP and M1, respectively, in the present study. NP-specific T-cell cross-reactivity against H7N9 showed a high level among the members of the pH1N1 Ab \u03e9 population. Interestingly, we found biased T-cell cross-reactivities in responses to M1 proteins derived from different AIVs. The similarity of the M1 sequences in the two strains was lower (92%) than those of NP (93%) and other internal proteins (PB1 [96%], PB2 [97%], and PA [96%]). Besides, the influences of the substitutions on immunogenicity would be different among different proteins, which may also contribute to varied cross-reactivity of the internal proteins between H1N1 and H7N9. Mutations in the M1 protein might have a larger influence on its immunogenicity. Considering the immunogenicity and dissimilarity conservation of these two proteins, we proposed that M1 might have a more dominant influence in eliciting T cell immunity among influenza viruses and chose M1 as the stimulus in the experiments that followed that assessed T cell cross-reactivity and heterogeneous protection. Thus, like the humoral response in HA, minor variations among the immunodominant epitopes may impact cross-T-cell reactivities, which should be carefully considered during the development of universal vaccines based on the M1 proteins of influenza viruses.",

Minor substitutions of the residues on the middle bulged region of the peptides can abrogate T-cell recognition (40) . Also, the thermal stability of pMHC could influence T-cell activation. Peptide Gag 180 -188 derived from HIV could be recognized by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*42:01, HLA-B*42:02, and HLA-B*81:01. However, Gag 180 -188 showed poor thermal stability with HLA-B*42:02 and elicited weaker T-cell responses (41) . Also, the substitutions of the primary or secondary anchor residues may completely change the antigenicity of the peptides (42) . As previously determined in structural studies, mutational escape in T-cell epitopes contributed to the antigenic disaccord (43, 44) . Gras et al. investigated the cross-reactive T-cell responses against HLA-B7 supertyperestricted variable epitope NP 418\u03ea426 in humans (43) . They found that cross-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T-cell immunity did not exist between the pH1N1 virus and recent seasonal influenza viruses due to structural variation of the solvent-exposed residues in T-cell epitopes that can be recognized by TCRs. Mutations of anchor residues (or partially solvent-exposed secondary anchors) can also dramatically decrease CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses and result in delayed viral clearance (45) . Moreover, the substitutions may also lead to an induced fit on the helices of MHC-I that form the peptide-binding groove (46) and thus impact TCR recognition (47) . In the structures of HLA-A*2402 with H1/H5derived peptide H1-P25 and H7/H9-specific epitope H7-P25, the I9M substitution influenced the solvent-exposed surface and decreased the force of anchoring of the peptide to HLA-A*2402. This indicated that variable antigenicities of nonconserved peptides could be largely influenced by both exposed positions for TCR docking and anchoring positions for MHC binding, which should be investigated in the HLA-A*2402 cohort.",

(A) An individual CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitope that has antigenic variation between pH1N1 (H1-P25, similar peptide in H5N1) and H7N9 (H7-P25) was determined among different donors with HLA-A*2402 restrictions. PBMCs from different donors were tested via the IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT assay by stimulation with individual H1-P25 and H7-P25 peptides. Abbreviation: SFC, spot-forming cell. (B) Tetramers of HLA-A*2402 complexed to H1-P25 or H7-P25 were prepared and utilized to stain influenza virus-specific T cells. (C) Binding of peptides H1-P25 and H7-P25 to HLA-A*2402 was elucidated by in vitro refolding. Peptides with the ability to bind to HLA-A*2402 help the HLA-A*2402 H chain to refold in vitro in the presence of \u2424 2 m. After properly refolding, the high absorbance peaks of HLA-A*2402 with the expected molecular mass of 45-kDa eluted at the estimated volume of 16 ml on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. The profile is marked with the approximate positions of the molecular mass standards of 67.0, 35.0, and 14.0 kDa.

Residue I9 inserts its side chain into hydrophobic pocket E. Residue K4 forms a hydrogen bond with E8. The peptide binding groove is shown by the vacuum electrostatic surface potential of HLA-A*2402 H chain.

Mice were preinfected with pH1N1 virus (10 3.8 TCID 50 ) and, 28 days later, challenged with a lethal dose of A(H1N1)/California/4/2009 (10 5.8 TCID 50 ) (A to C), A(H5N1)/Vietnam/1194/2004 (10 5.2 TCID 50 ) (D to F), or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (10 5.6 TCID 50 ) (G to I), as well as with PBS as a control. Survival status, body weight, and viral titration of lung homogenates were determined (A to I). The numbers of mice used for survival and weight analyses were as follows: n \u03ed 9 for PBS-PBS, n \u03ed 10 for PBS-H1N1, n \u03ed 10 for PBS-H5N1, n \u03ed 7 for PBS-H7N9, n \u03ed 10 for H1N1-PBS, n \u03ed 10 for H1N1-H1N1, n \u03ed 10 for H1N1-H5N1, and n \u03ed 9 for H1N1 to H7N9.

(C, F, and I) Lung homogenate samples were collected at 3, 7, and 14 days postinfection. Data are shown with the mean \u03ee SEM virus titers of three mice per time point. (J) Levels of antibodies to pH1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 of H1N1-positive serum samples were tested by MN assay. (K and L) Levels of antibodies to pH1N1 and H5N1 in H5N1-positive serum samples (K) and levels of antibodies to pH1N1 and H7N9 of H7N9-positive serum samples (L) were also tested. (M) Cross-reactive T-cell responses to H5N1 and H7N9 of spleen cells isolated from mice infected with pH1N1 for 2 weeks were determined by IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT assays. (",

MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). The A(H5N1)/Vietnam/1194/ 2004, A(H6N1)/Taiwan/2/2013, A(H7N9)/Anhui/1/2013, and A(H9N2) /Hong Kong/1073/99 viruses were propagated in 9-to-11-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.). Serological assays. HAI and MN assays were performed using A(H1N1)/California/4/2009, A(H5N1)/ Vietnam/1194/2004, A(H6N1)/Taiwan/2/2013, A(H7N9)/Anhui/1/2013, and A(H9N2)/Hong Kong/1073/99 inactive virus antigens, in accordance with WHO protocols (18). Titers of \u05461:40 for HAI and 1:80 for MN were defined as seropositive. Design and synthesis of influenza virus-derived peptide pools. Peptides (15-to 18mers) overlapping by 11 residues and spanning the M1 protein of A(H1N1)/California/4/2009, A(H5N1)/Vietnam/ 1194/2004, A(H6N1)/Taiwan/2/2013, A(H7N9)/Anhui/1/2013, and A(H9N2)/Hong Kong/1073/99 were designed and synthesized as previously described",
