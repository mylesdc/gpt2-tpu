If virus contributes no or low cytopathic effects to cells, these foci may be visualized by immunostaining [22, 23] . If virus induces strong cytopathogenic effects (CPE), cells in plaques are lysed and plaques can be visualized by staining of the residual intact cells. Cytopathogenic plaque assays are compatible with high throughput screening [24, 25] and facilitate plaque purification and cloning of virus. This in turn is helpful in obtaining virus stocks of optimized infectivity, e.g., by decreasing the amount of defective interfering (di) particles that accumulate during serial passaging of CoV [26] . Important technical achievements have been made in studying NL63 replication, including, most recently, the development of an infectious cDNA clone [27] . Still it is a major obstacle that hCoV-NL63 replicates slowly and at relatively low titres in all current cell cultures, such as LLC-MK2 and Vero-B4 cells [4, 28, 29] . Because the virus contributes very weak and diffuse CPE to these cells, there is no cytopathic plaque assay available for non-recombinant virus [28] .",
