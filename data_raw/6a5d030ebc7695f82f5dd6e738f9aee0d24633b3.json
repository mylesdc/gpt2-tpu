Novel antiviral agents need to be developed to control this situation. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the activities of five broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against several important swine-origin pathogenic viruses by TCID 50 assay. Plaque reduction assay and cell apoptosis assay were also used to test the activity of the peptides. Protection effect of piscidin against pseudorabies virus (PRV) was also examined in mouse model. Results: Piscidin (piscidin 1), caerin (caerin 1.1) and maculatin (maculatin 1.1) could inhibit PRV by direct interaction with the virus particles in a dose-dependent manner and they could also protect the cells from PRV-induced apoptosis. Among the peptides tested, piscidin showed the strongest activity against PRV. Moreover, in vivo assay showed that piscidin can reduce the mortality of mice infected with PRV. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that piscidin has antiviral activity against PRV.",

The pathogenic viruses isolated from pigs including pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and rotavirus (RV) are commonly observed in China. The viral infection is also responsible for the secondary infection by bacteria which has greatly increased the application of antibiotics [1, 2] . In the past decades, the efforts to alleviate pig viral diseases have focused on the development of vaccines to enhance the adaptive immunity of the hosts [3, 4] . However, some of the evolving viruses could escape from the host immunity through different kinds of strategies. Several viral diseases have broken out in recent years among pig herds, such as the reemergence of swine-origin influenza in 2009 [5] , PED in late 2010 [6] and Pseudorabies in 2012 [7] . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel potential agents to kill these viruses or block their infection.",

Ever since their discovery, AMPs have gained worldwide attention as important alternatives in the field of disease prevention and immune modulation [8, 9] . Previous studies mostly focused on the protection effect of AMPs against bacterial and fungal infection [10] . Later on, AMPs were also reported to be effective against viral infection [11] . It has been reported that some alpha-helical peptides can act as virucidal agents. For example, caerins and maculatins isolated from amphibian skin could completely inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection after virus is exposed to peptides within minutes [12] . Piscidins, discovered in the mast cells of fish, could reduce the infectivity of several important fish-origin viruses [13] . Indolicidin, a natural 13-amino acid antimicrobial peptide isolated from bovine neutrophils, could directly kill HIV-1 [14] . Bovine lactoferricin derived from bovine lactoferrin has been reported to exert antiviral activity to fight against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and adenovirus [15] . Other antimicrobial agents, such as human defensins which is a group of beta-sheet peptides, can inhibit enveloped viruses such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, HIV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus, and HCMV by directly inactivating viruses [16] . Therefore, AMPs might be promising agents against viral infections.",

Four enveloped viruses were used in this assay including the PRV Ea strain, PEDV YNKM strain, TGEV WH-1 strain, and PRRSV YA isolate, as well as one non-enveloped RV TM-a strain. The peptides exhibited different inhibitory activities against these viruses (Fig. 1) . The relative potency of the peptides against PRV was: piscidin\u2248caerin>ma-cualtin>indolicidin> lactoferricin B. Piscidin and caerin showed strong virucidal activity with the residual infectivity being around 2.3% while indolicidin and lactoferricin B exhibited mild antiviral activity. In descending order of potency, the peptides against PEDV ranked as follows: caerin>piscidin> maculatin>lactoferricin B > indolicidin. Caerin had the most potent activity with the residual infectivity being 0.2%. The assay results indicated, that the order of potency versus PRRSV was: caerin>lactoferricin B > piscidin>maculatin>indolicidin. Caerin exhibited the best inhibitory activity with the residual infectivity being 41.1%, separately. The assay results of antivirus activity against TGEV indicated the activity order as follows: piscidin>lactoferricin B > indolicidin>maculatin>caerin. Piscidin was the most potent peptide versus TGEV with the residual infectivity being 41.5%. The assay result also indicated that PRRSV and TGEV were less sensitive to the tested peptides, compared with other viruses (Fig. 1) . When it comes to RV, the relative potency order was: piscidin>caerin>maculatin>lactoferricin B > indolicidin. Piscidin displayed the most potent activity against RV with residual infectivity being 7.4%. Piscidin and caerin exhibited activity against almost all the viruses with the residual infectivity being lower than 50% with exception of piscidin versus PRRSV and caerin versus TGEV. Caerin showed the greatest inhibitory activity against PEDV with the residual infectivity being 0.2%, which was the lowest value among all the viruses tested. Maculatin exhibited strong activity against PRV (10.1%) and mild activity against RV (43.4%). However, it showed limited activity against PEDV, PRRSV, and TGEV. Lactoferricin B and indolicidin were not as potent as other peptides to fight against viruses. Lactoferricin B showed stronger inhibitory activity against TGEV than against other tested viruses with residual infectivity being 54.1%, and residual infectivity of indolicidin versus PRV was 34.6%.",

However there has been limited information about the inhibitory activity of these peptides against the swine-origin viruses. Considering this, this study evaluated the effect of these peptides against several porcine viral pathogens. Three peptides (caerin, piscidin, maculatin) exhibited inhibitory activity against PRV, PEDV, TGEV, PRRSV, and rotavirus. Plaque reduction assay showed that the PRV infection could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by direct treatment of the peptides.",

            "text": "A previous study indicated that caerin and maculatin could inhibit HIV infection without affecting T-cell viability and that the activity of caerin was more potent than that of maculatin [12] . In our research, we further tested the activity of caerin and maculatin against PRV, PEDV and PRRSV. Compared with maculatin, caerin showed better activity against most of the tested viruses except TGEV (Fig. 1) . The fact that caerin has a longer \u03b1-helix than maculatin, which enables caerin to disintegrate the membrane more potently, might explain the better activity of caerin. Usually, the bacterial membrane and viral envelope were reported to be the main targets of the AMPs. For example, HIV envelope integrity was directly disrupted by caerin and maculatin [12] . However in this study, TGEV and PRV which both acquired their envelopes from PK-15, exhibited different levels of sensitivity to the tested peptides. In addtion to its envelope, physical characteristics of the virus such as viral size, surface area, and morphology might affect its sensitivity. HNP-1 also demonstrated a 1000-fold difference in activity against different enveloped viruses [16] . It should also be noted that the antiviral activity of the AMPs tested in this study is only observed at concentrations that are already somewhat cytotoxic at 48 h and could be even more so at 72 h or longer. To our surprise, piscidin, caerin, and maculatin A B Fig. 6 Piscidin protects mice from PRV-induced death. a. processed brain sections from control, co-treated, and PRV infected groups were subjected to Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The representative H&E results were shown. b. The mice injected with piscidin or PRV, co-treated with piscidin and PRV were divided into different groups. Surviving mice were challenged with PRV on day 14 again. Survival status of control and experiment groups were monitored on a daily basis for 28 days (n = 10). In the group of piscidin (10 \u03bcg/ml), 2 mice were heavily infected and died on day 19 and 20. And another 5 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized for animal welfare reasons; In the group of piscidin (0 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV, 2 mice were heavily infected and died on day 5. And another 7 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized for animal welfare reasons; In the group of piscidin (10 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV, 1 mouse was heavily infected and died on day 19. And another 6 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized for animal welfare reasons; In the group of piscidin (5 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV, 3 mice were heavily infected and died on day 19 and 20. And another 7 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized for animal welfare reasons; In the group of piscidin (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV, 1 mice were heavily infected and died on day 20. And another 6 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized respectively for animal welfare reasons; In the group of piscidin (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV, 3 mice were heavily infected and died on day 5 and 7. And another 6 mice with severe neurological symptoms were euthanized for animal welfare reasons; A total of 11 mice from all groups survived and were euthanized by the end of the experiment could consistently inhibit the growth of RV, a non-enveloped RNA virus. Among these three peptides, piscidin showed the strongest inhibitory activity. It has been reported that piscidin possessed significant antiviral activity to fight against both frog virus 3 and channel catfish virus [30] . The reduction of FV3 infectivity resulting from the application of piscidin is due to its capacity to interact with the essential lipid membrane of FV3 [13] . Based on these results, it could be speculated that there might be other targets for these peptides in addition to the viral envelope, which need further exploration.",

By 144 h post infection, most of the PRV inoculated mice showed constant tremors in inoculated leg and distinctive PRV symptoms of excitation, scratching and biting of the foot. By 168 h post infection, severe neurological symptoms of severe pruritus, ataxia, biting and bleeding of the footpad could be observed. The mice in the piscidin treated groups also showed similar symptoms, but symptoms appeared later and not so severe in piscidin treated mice than those in PRV infected mice. And the mice in the control group [Piscidin (10 \u03bcg/ml)] remained asymptomatic, posture normal without signs of neurological symptoms. In the group [Piscidin (0 \u03bcg/ml) + PRV], 90% of the mice (n = 10) died within 10 days showing typical symptoms of PRV infection.
