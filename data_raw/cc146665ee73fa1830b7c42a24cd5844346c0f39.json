To obtain more information regarding the causes of CNS infections in Indonesia, this study was performed to detect and identify viral agents associated with CNS infections amongst in-patients at a referral hospital in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Adult patients admitted to R.D. Kandou General Hospital with presumed CNS infection were enrolled. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and throat swab samples were collected and tested using molecular, serological, and virus isolation assays. A confirmed viral etiology was established in three and a probable/possible in 11 out of 74 patients. The most common was herpes simplex virus 1 (7/74, 9.5%), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (2/74, 2.7%), cytomegalovirus (1/74, 1.4%), enterovirus D68 (1/74, 1.4%), rhinovirus A (1/74, 1.4%), dengue virus (1/64, 1.6%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (1/64, 1.6%). There were 20 fatal cases (27.0%) during hospitalization in which eight were associated with viral causes. We identified herpes simplex virus 1 as the most common cause of CNS infection among adults in North Sulawesi with most of the cases remaining undiagnosed. Our study highlights the challenges in establishing the etiology of viral CNS infections and the importance of using a wide range of molecular and serological detection methods to identify CNS viruses.",

Viruses are considered as important etiological agents of CNS infections, causing diseases ranging from febrile illness a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 to myelitis to meningoencephalitis [1] . However, in most cases, the etiology of CNS infection is not known due to lack of diagnostic capacity, standard clinical case definitions, or low levels of surveillance. Specific diagnosis for CNS infection is rarely made and usually categorized empirically as only \"viral\" or \"bacterial\". There have been few reports on the viral etiologies of CNS infections in Indonesia except for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a leading cause of acute encephalitis in children and young adults in the Southeast Asian region [2] [3] [4] [5] . Still, JEV is significantly underreported in Indonesia. Furthermore, in endemic provinces like Bali where encephalitis is often suspected to be JEV [5] , there is lack of laboratory capability to accurately determine the disease burden of JEV and other CNS viruses. The objective of this study was therefore to detect and identify the pathogens responsible for viral CNS infections amongst in-patients at a referral hospital in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. ",

Patients (age \ufffd15 years) presenting at the adult wards from August 2015-February 2017 with presumed CNS infections were enrolled based on the following criteria: acute onset (\ufffd7 days) fever (>37.5\u02daC) with altered mental state, accompanied by seizures, or focal neurological findings or neck stiffness. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected along with computed tomographic (CT) scan with and without contrast as part of their assessment. In addition, throat swabs were also collected from those without altered consciousness, agitation or seizures, and not critically ill, in viral transport medium containing Eagle's minimum essential medium, 500 U/ml penicillin, 500 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA).

CSF was examined by lateral flow assay and India ink for detection of Cryptococcus neoformans, Gram stain for detection of bacteria, and direct acid-fast bacilli smear examination for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, chest X-ray was also performed if clinically indicated for TB. With limited capacity for advanced microbiological testing, CSF bacterial and TB cultures were not performed on-site. Undiagnosed CNS infection patients regardless of the HIV status, TB status, and CSF laboratory results were enrolled to determine the viral cause and HIV-associated viral infections. In addition, all undiagnosed CNS infections regardless of the presumptive clinical diagnosis (meningitis/encephalitis) were included in this study. Clinical outcome was scored on discharge according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) [6] . Patients were monitored at the hospital longitudinally until discharge or death.",

The CNS infection was classified as confirmed, probable, or possible based on each individual pathogen, type of specimen, association with previous medical condition, and clinical characteristics [7] . In brief, etiology was considered confirmed for cases with positive results by molecular tests or virus isolation or virus-specific IgM in CSF for a pathogen considered to be a well-established cause of encephalitis. For example, detection of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in CSF was considered confirmatory. Etiology was considered probable if 1) the pathogen or its nucleic acid were not detected in CSF but there was serological evidence or 2) in cases where a pathogen not generally causing encephalitis was detected in CSF. For example, detection of anti-JEV IgM in a single serum sample was considered probable. Etiology was considered possible for cases with positive results other than in CSF with evidence of acute infection that suggested a potential etiologic role in CNS infection. For example, detection of HSV-1 and enteroviruses (EV) by PCR/RT-PCR in serum or throat swab samples were considered possible.",

All primers have been previously described in previous publications [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . For alphavirus and flavivirus RT-PCR, Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR (Qiagen) kit was used. For all other PCR or RT-PCR, GoScript Reverse Transcription System and GoTaq Green Master Mix kits were used (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Synthetic DNA plasmid constructs kindly provided by PREDICT USAID were used as 'universal positive controls' for filovirus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, and enterovirus PCR as described before [16] . RNA extracted from isolates of JEV Nakayama strain and CHIKV 181/ 25 strain were used for flavivirus and alphavirus RT-PCR controls, respectively. Extracted viral nucleic acid from available CSF, serum, and throat swabs were amplified by PCR/RT-PCR panels described above, from which positive amplicons were further purified and sequenced with both forward and reverse primers using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Although the non-arboviral group primers have not been evaluated with clinical specimens, the analytical sensitivities have been reported elsewhere [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition, inhouse validation of the PCR/RT-PCR assays were performed by testing each panel against extracted RNA from serial dilutions of known virus isolates or synthetic DNA control. The pan-flavivirus RT-PCR was able to detect extracted RNA from at least 0.4 PFU/ml of DENV-1, -2, -4; 400 PFU/ml of DENV-3; 0.4 PFU/ml of JEV; and 4 PFU/ml of ZIKV; while the panalphavirus RT-PCR was able to detect 1,000 PFU/ml of CHIKV 181/25 strain. The flavivirus isolates used to evaluate pan-flavivirus RT-PCR have been described elsewhere [17] . The panenterovirus RT-PCR was able to detect at least 12 PFU/ml poliovirus Sabin vaccine strain and 89 copies of synthetic DNA control. The pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR was able to detect 1.4 PFU/ml measles virus vaccine strain CAM70 and 2.5 copies of synthetic DNA control. Finally, the pan-filovirus, pan-coronavirus, and pan-herpesvirus PCR/RT-PCR were able detect at least 60 copies, 28 copies, and 1 copy of synthetic DNA control, respectively. Representative gel electrophoresis with positive results from the PCR/RT-PCR is shown in S1 Fig.",

In addition, throat swab samples were tested for the six non-arbovirus panels. The viral diagnostic assays performed and viruses identified were summarized in Table 2 .

In this study, the case fatality of those with viral etiology (57.1%) was substantially higher than in the region [30, 31] , with the majority (62.5%) associated with HSV-1. This highlights the significance of HSV-1 as a cause of fatal CNS infection in Indonesia. In our study, two HSV positive cases, one fatal, were found to co-exist with HIV.

Since IgM does not normally cross the blood-brain barrier, detection of anti-DENV IgM in the CSF is an indication of host immune response to DENV invasion in the CNS [33] . The absence of DENV RNA and NS1 antigen in the CSF is not unexpected as low sensitivity of RT-PCR in CSF has been reported due to a lower viral load [34] . The dengue patient in this study did not exhibit shock, bleeding, or thrombocytopenia, and the patient was discharged with mild cognitive sequelae. The absence of notable dengue clinical manifestations in this patient is not uncommon as one study has reported that 57% of confirmed DENV-infected patients with CNS involvement had no characteristic features of dengue on admission [19] . Although CNS manifestations are rare complications of dengue, it is now recognized as an emerging cause of flavivirus encephalitis [34] . There should be an increased awareness among physicians to include dengue in the differential diagnosis of CNS infection as DENV could be a significantly underreported cause of viral infection of the CNS. Studies have shown that the outcome of dengue encephalitis is variable, with most patients recovering spontaneously in one case series and deaths occurring in others [34] .",

Our pan-enterovirus PCR primers were designed to detect a conserved segment in untranslated region of EVs and have been successfully used to detect a broad range of EVs including coxsackievirus B3 and rhinovirus C [15, 38] ; enterovirus A71, rhinovirus A, echovirus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus B4, A6, and A16 [39] ; as well as a number of novel enteroviruses, from various types of clinical samples [16, 40] . The detection rate could be low in our study population of adults as enterovirus CNS infection is commonly seen in pediatric patients but in less than 1% of adults. Although EV-D68 has been more associated with mild to severe upper and lower respiratory illnesses, some studies have associated this virus with CNS diseases [41, 42] . Furthermore, while RV-A is considered the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infection, occasional detection of RV-A from CNS infection has been reported [37, 43] . Our RV-A case could be a coexisting infection without sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship with the CNS infection.",

            "text": "There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, serology is limited to that of arboviruses, and the use of HSV IgM might allow more cases to be diagnosed [45] . Second, not all potential causes of viral meningitis/encephalitis were screened in this study; influenza virus, rubella virus, adenovirus, parechovirus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus may have been missed due to lack of testing. Third, the incidence of EV might have been underestimated in this study due to failure to collect swab specimens in 48 patients (64.9%). Forth, EBV and CMV may remain latent in B cells and can make PCR positive results difficult to interpret [46] . Fifth, MRI which is more sensitive than CT, was not performed under resource-limited healthcare settings. Sixth, the prevalence of etiological agents detected in this study might be low compared with other studies [25, 26, 28, 29, 47] , possibly due to the different molecular tools used (pan-family vs virus-specific PCR/RT-PCR) and case selection methods (suspected CNS infection vs encephalitis/meningoencephalitis only). Seventh, with a small sample size, our conclusions on viral etiology might not be statistically significant. Finally, CSF specimens were not always available to make a definitive diagnosis of viral etiology as some patients did not consent to lumbar puncture and viral transport medium for throat swabs was not always available. However, even with these limitations, a range of viruses was identified as associated with CNS disease in eastern Indonesia suggesting that testing should be broader than is routinely conducted.",

Many challenges exist in determining the etiology of viral CNS infections including the timing of specimen collection, optimal storage, locating the laboratory network, and cost of testing. Determining the causes of CNS infections is becoming increasingly important with the emergence of new viruses. With the challenge of taking multiple samples in general hospitals, CSF should be emphasized as the recommended specimen on admission for patients presenting with suspected CNS infection with a follow-up serum specimen at discharge (or death) for serologic confirmation. The results of this study highlight the importance of using a wide range of molecular panels and detection methods for CNS viruses as to optimize treatment strategies, guide public health measures or develop targeted vaccination recommendations. However, in resource-limited settings, it is highly recommended that initial viral screening should include HSV and EV as well as flavivirus serological assays. ",
