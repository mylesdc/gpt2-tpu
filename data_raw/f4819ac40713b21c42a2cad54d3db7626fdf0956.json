This study aimed to evaluate the anti-influenza viral activity and possible mechanisms of 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae family). Methods: Twelve phenanthrenes were isolated and identified from B. striata. Influenza virus A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) propagated in embryonated chicken eggs was used. Phenanthrenes mixed with the virus were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route to survey the antiviral activity in vivo. A (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS)based assay was performed to evaluate the reduction of cytopathic effect induced by H3N2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to study the blockage of virus receptors by the phenanthrenes, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay to evaluate the effects of the release of virus. The synthesis of influenza viral matrix protein mRNA in response to compound treatment was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.",

In MDCK models, the phenanthrenes did not show significant antiviral activity when administered as pretreatment, while phenanthrenes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 10, and 11 exhibited inhibitory activities as simultaneous treatment with 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) ranging from 14.6 \u00b1 2.4 to 43.3 \u00b1 5.3 \u03bcM. The IC 50 ranged from 18.4 \u00b1 3.1 to 42.3 \u00b1 3.9 \u03bcM in the post-treatment assays. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; and compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 resulted in the reduced transcription of virus matrix protein mRNA. However, no compound could inhibit hemagglutination by the influenza virus. Conclusion: Phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity in both embryonated eggs and MDCK models, and diphenanthrenes seemed to have stronger inhibition activity compared with monophenanthrenes.",

The vaccines need to be reformulated almost every year owing to antigenic drift, and the timely production of pandemic vaccines remains problematic because of the limitations of current technology [1] [2] [3] [4] . Antiviral drugs play a significant role in controlling the spread of the disease, but the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has been reported occasionally [5, 6] , which has become a serious public health concern globally. Therefore, safe and effective new antiviral drugs need to be developed urgently to combat viral infections for either therapeutic or prophylactic purposes.",

            "text": "Two surface glycoproteins are present on the envelope of the influenza virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The life cycle of the influenza virus begins with viral HA binding to sialic acid (SA) receptors on the host cell surface, followed by internalization of the virus by receptor-mediated endocytosis [7, 8] . Subsequently, endosomal acidification alters the conformation of HA and leads to the fusion of the host and viral membranes, which allows the release of the viral nucleoproteins (NPs) into the cytoplasm. In the nucleus of the infected cells, the viral RNAs are transcribed into mRNAs and replicated. Finally, the newly synthesized viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) are exported into the cytoplasm, and after packaging, mature virions are released from the cell surface depending on the cleaving of SA receptors by sialidase. Therefore, HA plays a key role in initiating viral infection by binding to SA-containing receptors on the host cells, thus mediating the subsequent viral entry and membrane fusion [9] [10] [11] . The NA cleaves the specific linkage of the SA receptor, resulting in the release of the newly formed virions from the infected cells [12, 13] . Oseltamivir, marketed under the trade name Tamiflu, was the first orally administered commercially developed NA inhibitor. It was discovered using shikimic acid as a starting point for synthesis. Shikimic acid was originally available as an extract of Chinese star anise. Oseltamivir is on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, a list of the most important medications needed in a basic health system. However, it was found that a substantial number of patients might become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use and that oseltamivir resistance might be significantly associated with pneumonia [14, 15] .",

In addition, it was reported to have antimicrobial [20] , antioxidant [20] , and anti-inflammatory activities [21] . The chemical components of B. striata and its 2,2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging, ferric-reducing antioxidant, and tyrosinase-inhibitory activities were studied [22] . Furthermore, six biphenanthrenes were separated, and their antibacterial activities were reported [23] .

The MTS-based CPE reduction assay of the MDCK model was used to confirm the antiviral activity. The antiviral effect of the compounds was quantified using the selectivity index (SI), which was the ratio of CC 50mean versus IC 50mean values ( Table 3 ).

The antiviral property of phenanthrenes from B. striata against the influenza A virus was investigated in this study using embryonated hen eggs, and it was confirmed that compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 exerted significant inhibitory effects. In MDCK models, compounds 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11 exhibited CPE reduction activities. The study showed that phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity. Furthermore, the HA, matrix protein, and NA were employed as targets for the study of possible mechanisms.",

Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; compounds 3, 4, and 6 displayed a higher inhibitory activity. NA is an exoglycosidase that destroys the HA receptor by cleaving the \u03b1(2,6)or \u03b1(2,3)-ketosidic linkage that exists between a terminal SA and a sugar residue of the Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-containing receptor on the surface of the host cells [5] . Neuraminidase inhibitors commonly interfere with the enzyme activity by mimicking the natural substrate and fitting into the active site of the neuraminidase enzyme. The binding efficiency of the compound with the neuraminidase is the major determinant of the inhibitory activity. The structure-activity relationship of new neuraminidase inhibitors should be proved for better molecular properties and higher efficiency against neuraminidase receptor compared with zanamivir or oseltamivir.",

Indeed, these four compounds do not share the same molecular structure. The results could have been biased by the small number of eggs used in the experiments. There is also a possibility that these compounds share a mechanism that has not been studied here. In addition, some compounds inhibited the influenza virus through two mechanisms, but the reasons for this dual inhibition are currently unknown. Additional studies are necessary to better characterize these compounds.",

In MDCK models, the antiviral effects of most monophenanthrenes were less than 50% except compound 10, while the effects of diphenanthrenes were all higher than 50% and IC 50 could be calculated. This might be because of the hydroxyl group, which impacts the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the compound. All diphenanthrenes share more hydroxyl groups. However, how the hydroxyl group affects the antiviral activity still needs further investigation. Compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 served as matrix protein inhibitors and resulted in the reduction of mRNA transcription. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA.

PBS and the virus without treatment were used as controls, and the positive control was oseltamivir phosphate. The medium was removed after 18 h. The cells were scraped off, washed twice with PBS, and collected by centrifugation (500\u00d7g for 3 min). Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using a One-Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa Biotech, Dalian, China). The primer sequences used for quantitative real-time PCR of viral matrix protein mRNA were 5\u2032-GAC CRA TCC TGT CAC CTC TGA C-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-AGG GCA TTY TGG ACA AAK CGT CTA-3\u2032 (antisense)[30].
