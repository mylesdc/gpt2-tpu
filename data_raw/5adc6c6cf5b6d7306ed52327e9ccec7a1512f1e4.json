            "text": "Recombination in the family Coronaviridae has been well documented and is thought to be a contributing factor in the emergence and evolution of different coronaviral genotypes as well as different species of coronavirus. However, there are limited data available on the frequency and extent of recombination in coronaviruses in nature and particularly for the avian gamma-coronaviruses where only recently the emergence of a turkey coronavirus has been attributed solely to recombination. In this study, the full-length genomes of eight avian gamma-coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates were sequenced and along with other full-length IBV genomes available from GenBank were analyzed for recombination. Evidence of recombination was found in every sequence analyzed and was distributed throughout the entire genome. Areas that have the highest occurrence of recombination are located in regions of the genome that code for nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, and the structural spike glycoprotein. The extent of the recombination observed, suggests that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within IBV. These data indicate that reticulate evolutionary change due to recombination in IBV, likely plays a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus leading to new genetic types and strains of the virus.",

In layer type birds it can cause a drop in egg production and some strains are nephropathogenic. Infectious bronchitis remains one of the most widely reported respiratory diseases of chickens worldwide despite the routine usage of attenuated live vaccines to control the disease. Control of IBV is difficult because there is little to no cross-protection between the numerous different serotypes of the virus.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome length of approximately 27 kb. The 3' end of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as several non-structural proteins [1] . The S glycoprotein of IBV forms projections on the surface of the virion. Spike is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 subunit forming the outermost portion and S2 forming a stalk-like structure that is embedded in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host cell receptors, and it contains conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [2, 3] . Spike is also involved in membrane fusion and viral entry into the host cell. The E and M proteins are integral membrane proteins involved in assembly of the virus. The N protein is closely associated with the viral genome and plays a role in replication. The 5' two-thirds of the genome, approximately 21 kb, encodes two polyproteins 1a and 1ab. A minus one frame-shift mechanism is used to translate the 1ab polyprotein. The polyproteins are post-translationally cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsp 2-16 (IBV does not have an nsp1) that make up the replication complex. Key nsps encoded, include a papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) within nsp 3, a main protease (Mpro) within nsp 5, and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) within nsps 11 and 12. Genetic diversity in coronaviruses is due to adaptive evolution driven by high mutation rates and genetic recombination [4] . High mutation rates are attributed to minimal proof reading capabilities associated with the RdRp. Recombination is thought to be due to a unique template switching \"copy-choice\" mechanism during RNA replication [5] . Evidence of recombination among strains of IBV has been observed both experimentally and in the field [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The emergence of several alpha-and beta-coronaviruses has been attributed to recombination [12, 13] but only recently was recombination shown to be the mechanism behind the emergence of a novel gamma-coronavirus, turkey coronavirus (TCoV) [14] . Although \"hot spots\" of recombination in the genome of IBV have been reported [9, 15] , a thorough study of recombination using multiple different strains across the entire genome has not been conducted.",

The overall percent similarities between the various strains are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . All IBV genomes examined are greater than 80% similar at the nucleotide level. genomes available in the database for CK/CH/EP3, CK/CH/p65, and Mass/Beaudette were excluded from the analysis because they are viruses not found in the field. The recombination programs can be used to detect recombination without reference sequences, and our analysis was conducted without regard to date of isolation because that information was not available for some of the viruses. Although the programs attempt to identify major and minor parent sequences contributing to each recombinant, the data reported herein only represents sequences in other viruses that are most closely related to the sequence surrounding the transferred fragment (major sequence) and the sequence closely related to the transferred fragment (minor sequences) and doesn't imply origin or source of the transferred fragment. In many cases, the transferred fragment has undergone mutations making it difficult to identify all the endpoints for the major and minor sequences. In addition, some of the transferred fragments overlap suggesting that recombinations have occurred between recombinant viruses.",

The strains with the fewest transferred fragments are Iowa/Iowa97/56 and TW/2575/98 with only 2 transferred fragments and the CK/CH/BJ/97, Holte/Holte/54, and NGA/A116E7/06 strains with only 1 transferred fragment. The Ark/Ark-DPI-p11/81 and Ark/Ark-DPI-p101/81 strains are the same virus that was passaged 11 and 101 times in embryonated eggs, respectively. Both viruses share identical transferred fragments indicating that they have identical recombination history. In addition, Conn/Conn46/66 and Conn/Conn46/91 share the same recombination history (4 identical transferred fragments). The Conn/Conn46/66 field virus was used to produce an attenuated live vaccine, which is currently used in commercial poultry. Viruses that share the same recombination history are likely derived from the same parent virus suggesting that Conn/Conn46/91 is reisolated Conn vaccine derived from the Conn/Conn46/66 virus. The FL/FL18288/71 virus also shares all 4 transferred fragments with the Conn viruses, however; FL/FL18288/71 and Conn viruses are different serotypes suggesting that FL/FL18288/71 is a field virus that emerged due to point mutations accumulating in spike over time rather than from recombination. All 6 of the transferred fragments in CK/CH/ZJ971/97 are identical to all 6 of the transferred fragments in vaccine strain Mass/H120, providing compelling evidence that CK/CH/ZJ971/97 is reisolated Mass/H120 vaccine. That observation was also reported by Zhang et al. [23] . It is interesting that Mass/H52 (8 transferred fragments) and Mass/H120 (6 transferred fragments) share only 5 identical transferred fragments. The Mass/H52 and Mass/H120 viruses were isolated circa 1955 in the Netherlands and it is widely accepted that H stands for Holland, but it actually stands for Houben, the owner of the broiler farm where the viruses were isolated [24] . It is thought that Mass/H120 was derived from Mass/H52 but the actual relationship between the viruses is not certain. Our data indicates that they are not necessarily parent and progeny but they are closely related.",

It is well known that the Gray/Gray/60 virus is nephropathogenic, whereas the JMK/JMK/64 virus is strictly respirotropic. Perhaps sequence differences in the 5'UTR, which is involved in replication of the viral genome, play a role in the different pathobiologies observed for these viruses. There is evidence that some transferred fragments in field viruses come from vaccines. As an example, CK/CH/LSD/051/06 has 3 of 7 and 2 of 7 transferred fragments in common with vaccine strains Mass/H52 and Mass/H120, respectively. In addition, the only fragments that USA viruses have in common with the viruses from China and Taiwan are fragments also associated with Mass type vaccines, which are used in both regions, providing further evidence that some of the fragments in field viruses come from vaccines. That result and the observation in Figure 1 that the viruses separated into clades based on geographic location also supports the conclusion that USA viruses have not recombined with Asian viruses.",

The nsp 2 contains hydrophobic residues that likely anchor the replication complex to the Golgi [29] . The nsp 3 encodes the protease PLP2 which cleaves nsps 2, 3, and 4 and an area with ADP-ribose 1'-phosphatase (ADRP) activity. The protease PLP2 has been shown to have deubiquinating-like activity [30] and also to be a type I interferon (IFN) antagonist [31] . Changes in the amino acid composition of this area could affect the ability of the virus to replicate in a variety of cell types. The ADRP region of nsp 3 is conserved among coronaviruses [32, 33] , and a recent study suggested a biological role for the coronavirus ADRP in modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory immune modulators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 [34] . Recombination in this area could alter the pathogenicity of the virus by modulating host cytokine expression. The nsp16 is reported to be an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent RNA (nucleoside-2'O)-methyltransferase (2'O-MTase) responsible for capping the viral mRNA nascent transcripts [32] .

Although this type of recombination is possible it appears to be rare in nature.In this study, we characterized recombination in the full-length genomes of avian gammacoronavirus IBV strains from around the world. Our bioinformatic analysis was similar to a previous study on enteroviruses [36] and we found that recombination in IBV is more extensive than formerly thought, involving regions across the entire genome. Our data suggests that reticulate evolution due to a high frequency of recombination in IBV, likely plays a major role in the generation of new serotypes of the virus. The characterization, distribution and frequency of recombination breakpoints are important information that will further our understanding of the mechanisms behind the diversity and evolution of these viruses so that better control methods can be developed.",

In addition, the IBV genomes were examined for recombination breakpoints using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP4, Version 4, Simmonics, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK) [21, 22] . Unless otherwise stated, default settings were used in all of the programs. The specific algorithms used were RDP [40] , GENECONV [41] , BOOTSCAN/RESCAN [40] , MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE [42] , CHIMAERA [43] , SISCAN [44] , and 3Seq [45] . We used more than one method to analyze the data because evaluation of these recombination detection methods using both simulated and empirical data showed that the results from only a single method were not very reliable [46] . Automasking was used for optimal recombination detection. The RDP analysis was run without a reference and a window size of 60, BOOTSCAN window size was increased to 500, MAXCHI and CHIMAERA number of variable sites per window was increased to 120, and the window size and step size for SISCAN was increased to 500 and 20, respectively. The window sizes were increased from their default settings because IBV has a high mutation rate, which can mask recombination signals. Increasing the window size was shown to increase the ratio of recombination signals relative to mutational \"noise\" [47] .",
