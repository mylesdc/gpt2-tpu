Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are not only a common causative agent of ARI among infants and young children, but these viruses are also associated with nosocomial acute respiratory illness in the immunocompromised, hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [4, 5, 6] . In the USA, it is estimated that 7600 to 48000 among children age ,1 year old and 8100 to 42600 children age 1 to 4 years were hospitalized with HPIVs infection annually [7] .",

Based on genetic and antigenic variation, HPIVs have been divided into types 1 to 4 [9] . The majority of their structural and biological characteristics are similar, but each type infects human at different ages and causes different diseases, such as upper respiratory infection, croup, bronchitis, and pneumonia [10, 11] . Almost all children encounter HPIVs within the first few years after birth, but immunity is incomplete and re-infections occur throughout life [12] . HPIV-1 is the most common pathogen associated with croup and is marked by biennial fall epidemics [13] . The majority of HPIV-1 infections occur in children aged 7 to 36 months [12, 14] . HPIV-3 infections occur yearly, mainly in spring and summer [15] .Unlike other HPIVs, approximately two-thirds of children are infected by HPIV-3 in the first year of life, mainly causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia [15] . Outbreaks of HPIV-2 usually follow HPIV-1 outbreaks depending on the time of years [16, 17, 18] . The majority of HPIV-2 infections occur in children younger than 5 years of age [6] .",

The HN gene failed to amplify from 16 HPIV-3 positive specimens, which had C t values ranging from 29 to 31 in real-time RT-PCR reaction. The failure to amplify could be due to the mismatches in the primer binding sites as a result of genetic diversity among strains of HPIV-3. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid homologies among these Beijing HPIV-3 isolates were between 97.2 and 100% and 98.7 and 100%, respectively. All genetic changes in the HPIV-3 isolates evaluated in this study were base substitutions without deletions, insertions, or frame-shift mutations. The mutations found among the different isolates were scattered throughout the HN gene. The divergence between the Beijing isolates and the prototype strain Wash/47885/57 was approximately 4.6-5.2% and 2.3-3% in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence, respectively. Compared to the prototype strain, the Beijing HPIV-3 isolates shared 11 unique amino acid changes, Met21Thr, IIe40Thr, His62Arg, Lys63Glu, IIe76Val, Met118IIe, IIe143Thr, Ser318Leu, Val348Ala, IIe391-Val, and Ser555Leu. Pairwise distances between the sequences were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method. The numbers in the distance matrix (data not shown) were plotted into a histogram that formed three peaks corresponding to the distance ranges suggesting the presence of strains, sub-clusters and clusters, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Two distance ranges did not overlap suggesting the HPIV-3 can be unambiguously classified into two distinct categories: strains and cluster. However, a minor peak occurred between strain and cluster range, indicating the diversity of stains within cluster.",

In general, HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 infection were important causes of lower respiratory infections and childhood hospitalization during the epidemic seasons [7] . Reports from the United States suggested that a minimum of 50% of croup cases were caused by HPIV-1 [10, 13, 33] . However, LRIs caused by HPIV-2 have been reported much lower frequencies than LRIs caused by HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 [7] . Our finding that HPIV-3 was the predominant HPIVs epidemic in the Beijing region may be because most specimens (84.9%) were collected from hospitalized patients with pneumonia whereas few specimens from bronchitis, bronchiolitis, upper respiratory infections and none from croup were tested. In addition, differences in the age distribution may be because younger children are at higher risk for HPIV-3 infections considering that most of patients (66.1%) enrolled in this study were younger than 12 months old. Similar findings reported in another study which showed that young infants (younger than 6 months) were particularly vulnerable to HPIV-3 infections [15] . However, long term studies are needed to determine the true prevalence of HPIVs in China.",

            "text": "Simultaneous infections by different viruses were observed in our study with 41.3% (183/443) of positive cases with mixed infections. This rate is significantly higher than those previously described in which co-infection rates ranged from 5 to 20% [34, 35, 36] . Interestingly, 77% (48/62) HPIVs infections were found as mixed infections. Among the HPIVs positive cases, coinfections with HCoV were most frequently found in children followed by HRVs, although RSV was the most common pathogen detected in our population. HRVs were identified in 16 out of 48 HPIVs co-infection cases, probably due to the increased detection sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR technologies. However, in the case of mixed infection, it has been hypothesized that picornaviruses could serve as a clinical illness promotion factor that functions additively or synergistically in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory syndromes such as bronchiolitis [37] . It was reported that RSV co-infection with HMPV may be a determination of disease severity [38, 39] . Therefore, further investigations are need to address high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses and to determine if the co-infections could results in enhanced severity of HPIVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all known HPIV-3 isolates could be divided into three distinct clusters (A, B and C) with at least 4.5% diversity between clusters. Cluster A and B contain strains mostly isolated from last century including the prototype strain, which seems to be less prevalent. Cluster C contains strains isolated from India, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia during 2003 to 2009, and was the predominant epidemic lineages of HPIV-3 in Asia. Cluster C was further classified into 4 sub-clusters C1-4. These findings indicate that cluster C isolates with distinct nucleotide divergence may spread widely. Although the Beijing isolates belonged to a single sub-cluster C3, multiple lineages of HPIV-3 co-circulating during the same epidemic season has been observed in this study. Lineage C3a, which contained 35 Beijing isolates, appeared to be more prevalent during the study period. Genetic analysis showed that HPIV-3 isolates were highly conserved with at least 95% and 97% identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels compared with the prototype strain (Wash/47885/57) which is consistent with previous reports [40] . Interestingly, 3 isolates, two of which are from distant provinces of China (Guangdong and Gansu) and one from the neighboring county of Japan, were genetically closely related to Beijing isolates and were grouped into lineage C3a. Our results implied that certain HPIV-3 strains have the potential to spread over different countries.",

Previous investigations suggested that the HPIV-3 F and HN glycoprotein have undergone little variation, with an overall low rate of noncumulative change and genetic heterogeneity [9, 41] . However, there has been conflicting evidence about whether the evolution of HPIV-3 is related temporally or geographically [42] . Sequence analysis of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 strains identified that geographically-defined genetic lineages might develop [26, 43] . As shown in the phylogenetic tree, the isolates from China and Japan formed a unique branch in subcluster C3a. Most of the isolates from same country in recent years were likely to be clustered into the same lineages. These results suggested that variation within the HN gene of HPIV-3 could somehow be correlated with the geographic origin of the strain. Interestingly, ten unique nucleotide differences which cause 2 amino acid changes in cluster C were identified and seem to be accumulating mutations. It is in contrast to the pervious study in which the pattern of HPIV-3 was similar to that of influenza C virus with a non-progressive random variation [44] . However, because of absence of HPIV-3 sequences collected over time and that from other countries could limit our ability clarify the evolution of HPIV-3.",

PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The purified PCR products were than sequenced with primers 3HNn+, P32(59-CTGAATTGTAAGAAGCCTTGT-39, nt 7094-nt 7114, anti-sense), PF+(59-CTCGAGGTTGTCAGGA-TATAG-39, nt 7437-nt 7457, sense), P5+(59-AACTGTGTT-CAACTCCCAAAG-39, nt 7605-nt 7625, sense) and P6+(59- ",

The obtained consensus sequences were compared with the prototype HPIV-3 sequences available in GenBank database using BLAST analysis (NCBI BLAST server). Nucleotide acid and deduced amino acid sequences of HPIV-3 were analyzed and aligned with BioEdit software (Tom Hall, North Carolina State University, Carolina, USA). Pairwise distances of nucleotide sequences in the 65 sequence alignment were calculated using Kimura 2-parametermethod within MEGA 5.0 package. The distance were sorted into three categories: Strain, the distance between strains within subclusters; Sub-cluster, the distances between strains across subcluster; and Cluster, the distance between strains across clusters, these data were used to generate histograms of the distribution of pairwise distance. The phylogenetic analyses were performed (MEGA version 5.0) by the neighbor-joining method using Kimura 2-parameters as substitution model, with statistical significance of phylogenies estimated by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 pseudoreplicate datasets. 42 representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers: GU732130-71.",
