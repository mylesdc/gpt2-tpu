Here we present a strategy that identifies protein-binding fragments through their potential to induce the targetguided formation of covalently bound, irreversible enzyme inhibitors. A protein-binding nucleophile reacts reversibly with a bis-electrophilic warhead, thereby positioning the second electrophile in close proximity of the active site of a viral protease, resulting in the covalent de-activation of the enzyme. The concept is implemented for Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease, a pharmacological target against enteroviral infections. Using an aldehyde-epoxide as bis-electrophile, active fragment combinations are validated through measuring the protein inactivation rate and by detecting covalent protein modification in mass spectrometry. The structure of one enzyme-inhibitor complex is determined by X-ray crystallography. The presented warhead activation assay provides potent non-peptidic, broad-spectrum inhibitors of enteroviral proteases.",

In contrast to classical screening, the templated assembly of protein ligands during the bioassay could be a tantalizing alternative having the potential to identify non-canonical protein ligands with improved potency, ligand efficiency and selectivity, while employing reduced human, ecological and financial resources [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Protein-templated reactions are driven by the (kinetic) enhancement of the ligand-forming reaction or by the thermodynamic stabilization of the proteinbinding ligation product, or by a combination of both. In any of the cases, however, the enhanced binding of a fragment ligation product will be accompanied by a shift of the ligation equilibrium and by the templated and enhanced formation of the bound ligation product. Enhanced binding of the fragment ligation product corresponds to over-additivity of fragment binding, which can be detected sensitively in biochemical and biophysical experiments.",

In this contribution, we investigate the combination of a reversible templated reaction and an irreversible templated reaction, which will enable the protein-guided assembly of protein ligands and their subsequent reaction as irreversible enzyme inhibitors. The described reaction sequence enables the testing of combinations of nucleophilic fragments and electrophilic warheads in a biochemical assay and inhibitory fragment combinations detected in this 'warhead activation assay' are used as blueprints for the construction of potent irreversible enzyme inhibitors. The described warhead activation assay is rationalized by structural and kinetic analysis of the formed fragment ligation products and is supported by molecular modelling of the putative intermediary fragment-protein complexes. Site-specific binding of several inhibitors is verified by protein mass spectrometry and the structure of one enzymeinhibitor complex is determined by protein crystallography. The most potent inhibitors possess broadband sub-micromolar activity towards a panel of seven entero-and rhinoviral 3C proteases indicating the feasibility of the fragment ligation approach described.",

The envisaged fragment-warhead activation assay is based on the idea that a templated ligation reaction of a protein-binding fragment with an electrophilic warhead should lead to the accelerated irreversible inhibition of the protein, if a reactive protein nucleophile is present (Fig. 1) . In this concept, a nucleophilic small-molecule fragment binds to a binding site of a protein (Fig. 1a, step 1) . The protein-binding fragment undergoes a reversible ligation reaction with a bis-electrophilic protein-reactive group (warhead) 21, 22 (step 2). The ligation reaction thereby positions the second reactive electrophilic functionality of the warhead at the active site of the protein inducing an irreversible, covalent reaction of the active-site nucleophile with the warhead (step 3) resulting in the irreversible deactivation of the protein. The described reaction sequence enables the testing of combinations of nucleophilic fragments and electrophilic warheads in a biochemical assay and inhibitory fragment combinations detected in this 'warhead activation assay' are blueprints for the construction of potent irreversible enzyme inhibitors.",

The genus Enterovirus comprises numerous human pathogens, including rhinoviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other humaninfecting viruses like EV-A71 and EV-B93 (refs 26,29,30) . Coxsackie virus 3C protease, like other enteroviral proteases, is a cysteine protease with a characteristic specificity for glutamine in the P1 position of its substrates (Fig. 1b) . Thus, for this target, fragments binding to the S1 pocket are biomimetics of the glutamine side chain, while the active-site nucleophile is the thiolate of cysteine 147 (Cys-147).",

For this purpose, a concentration of fragment 1 was determined, which decreased the activity of the protease by B10% over a time period of 10 min. This level of inhibition was used to ascertain the maximal sensitivity of the assay. A small library of 850 primary amine fragments, composed by applying a substructure analysis of the World Drug Index 35 , was screened in the fragment ligation assay. Fragment 2, 5-amino-1-cycloheptyl-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3-one (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 1 ), displayed the strongest overadditive effect of inhibition of protease activity. While fragments 1 or 2 alone reduced the enzyme's activity by no more than 10%, the protease was inhibited completely by a combination of 1 and 2 at the same concentrations (Fig. 3b) . Incubation of the protease with mixtures of 1 (1.2 equiv.) and 2 (1 equiv.) led to a concentration-dependent deactivation of the enzyme with an apparent IC 50 value of ca. 200 mM and a k inact /K I of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Deconvolution of the ESI-MS of the protease after ligation with a mixture of both fragments 1 and 2 showed the modification of the protein mass by addition of both fragments (144 \u00fe 195 \u00bc 339 Da) as the major mass peak (100% intensity, see Fig. 3c ). For comparison, the mass peak for the remaining unmodified protein displayed only 12% intensity and that of the protein coupled to the bis-electrophile 1 alone ca. 8%, supporting the assumption that the protein modification was strongly amplified by the presence of fragment 2. Incubation of the mutated protease C147A (ref. 36) did not display any modification in MS, indicating a selective alkylation of the active site.

Several different addition products of 1 and 2 were formed according to mass analysis and retention times and two of these products had the additive mass of both fragments, which had been observed in the deconvoluted MS of the protein sample reacted with both fragments. This formation of several different addition products of 1 and 2 is in agreement with the reported reactivity of 5-amino-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3ones, which were found to react with electrophiles at both the exocyclic amino group, the carbonyl oxygen and in the carbon-4 position 37, 38 . The product ratio varied strongly depending on the solvent and presence/absence of the protein target. Isolation of the formed ligation products by preparative column chromatography furnished again mixtures of compounds, indicating that they were formed reversibly in an equilibrium reaction. To evaluate the potential of the various ligation products as inhibitors, possible fragment combinations were generated in silico and docked 39 into the active site. Docking poses were selected according to their ability to bind and react in a similar manner as observed in PDB entry 3ZZA representing the crystal structure of CV3B 3C protease. In particular, two criteria were applied: (i) the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the lactam moiety of the co-crystallized ligand, and His-161 and Thr-142 in the S1 pocket had to be fulfilled by the docked poses for a plausible position in the binding site and (ii) the distance of cysteine sulfur and the potentially covalently binding electrophile of the ligation product had to be in a reasonable range for subsequent covalent binding (Supplementary Table 2 ). Docking of fragment 2 suggested that 2 can bind to the S1 pocket of the protease occupying the position of the primary amide of the native glutamine residue (Fig. 3d) . Sampling the various reaction paths of the electrophile 1 with the nucleophilic positions of fragment 2 supported the best fit for a nucleophilic attack by the carbon-4 ring position (Fig. 3e ). According to our docking experiments, the putative reaction product, a secondary alcohol, can be positioned in the active site of the protein and can be attacked by Cys-147 resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring and the formation of the covalent protein modification (Fig. 3f ).",

Trans-epoxide 3 was a moderately active irreversible inhibitor of the protease (k inact /K I \u00bc 3.7 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 ), while trans-epoxide 4 was a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. Cis-epoxide 5 was inactive as expected, so was the naphtyl-1-methyl amide 6, which was designed according to a recent report 40 . Increased reactivity with the protease was observed, when alternative electrophiles were linked to the primary fragment 2. While the acrylic ester derivative 7 was only a weak irreversible inhibitor with k inact /K I to 0.4 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 , the ethyl fumaroyl electrophile in 8, containing also a trans-olefine, raised the relative inactivation rate to 132 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 , more than 60-fold than the initial electrophile 1.

To assure that the inhibition of 12 was effected by the amino-pyrazolone fragment, the unsubstituted maleoyl amide ester 13 was prepared and found to be only moderately active (34 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 ).",

The approach combines a reversible, dynamic fragment ligation reaction with an irreversible covalent modification and inhibition of the target enzyme, Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease. Starting point for the discovery of protein-binding fragments was the bis-electrophilic warhead, epoxy-aldehyde 1, which combines an electrophilic motif for irreversible inhibition of cysteine proteases, the epoxide, with an aldehyde electrophile for the dynamic ligation of nucleophilic fragments. Warhead 1 alone was only a weak inhibitor of CVB3 3C protease but enabled the sensitive detection of a protein-binding fragment 2, a pyrazolone, from a collection of nucleophilic fragments. Using a FRET-based assay for protease activity, it could be demonstrated that the reversibly formed ligation product of 1 and 2 led to a 3.5-fold enhancement of the protein inactivation rate from 2.4 to 8.3 M \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 resulting in the strongly over-additive inhibition of the protease from 10 to 100% inhibition. The templating effect of the protease was confirmed by mass spectrometry showing that inhibition of the protease activity corresponded with shifting the equilibrium to the proteinfragment-warhead complex and thus resulted in the covalent modification of the enzyme's active site.",

In this concept, the protein template binding the initial fragment shifts the ligation equilibrium and thereby induces the protein modification reaction. The method should be principally applicable to other protein surfaces provided that the following three conditions are met: a protein-binding nucleophilic fragment, a bis-electrophile (warhead) that is able to bind to the fragment nucleophile and a nucleophilic protein site that enables the irreversible reaction with the bis-electrophile. Consequently, success of the method with alternative protein targets can be expected, if the bound fragment, the bis-electrophile, and the nucleophilic protein site fit spatially and in terms of their chemical reactivity. It should also be noted, however, as demonstrated in the presented work that initially detected fragment-warhead combinations can be optimized further by chemical modification.",

For a detailed binding confirmation of inhibitors 12 and 20 by ligand docking, see Supplementary Fig. 3 . Docking was performed using GOLD v 5.0.2 by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (Cambridge, UK, Europe) after protein preparation using MOE version 2,014.09 (ref. 50). The binding site was defined using a radius of 10 \u00c5 around the sulfur atom of cysteine 147. Docking was carried out using the PLP scoring function 51 with 25 GA runs per ligand in the most accurate mode without water molecules and default parameter settings. Covalent docking was performed by constraining the sulfur atom in the ligand and cysteine 147 to share the same position coordinates. Docking poses were analysed and prioritized for S1 pocket binding and putative covalent bond formation using 3D pharmacophore models developed in LigandScout version 4.0 (ref. 52) based on crystal structures of the CVB3 3C protease (3ZZ6, 3ZZ7, 3ZZ8, 3ZZ9, 3ZZA, 3ZZB). Graphical representations of selected conformations were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.",
