To improve our understanding of the host responses to PRV infection, we applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantitatively identify the differentially expressed cellular proteins in PRV-infected PK15 cells. In total, relative quantitative data were identified for 4333 proteins in PRV and mock-infected PK15 cells, among which 466 cellular proteins were differentially expressed, including 234 upregulated proteins and 232 downregulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that most of these differentially expressed proteins were involved in metabolic processes, cellular growth and proliferation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Moreover, expression levels of four representative proteins, beta-catenin, STAT1, GRB2 and PCNA, were further confirmed by western blot analysis. This is the first attempt to analyze the protein profile of PRV-infected PK15 cells using iTRAQ technology, and our findings may provide valuable information to help understand the host response to PRV infection.",

As shown in Fig. 1A , no obvious CPE was visible at 12 hpi; however, the CPE became readily apparent as the infection progressed. Obvious CPE was observed at 24 hpi and became significant at 36 and 48 hpi, including cell rounding, swelling, granular degeneration of the cytoplasm, cell detachment, and severely diseased cell morphology. The expression of PRV protein was monitored by IFA, and the results showed that almost all cells were infected at 24 hpi (Fig. 1B) . The one-step growth curve for PRV in PK-15 cells was also assessed. The viral titer peaked at 24 hpi and then gradually declined (Fig. 1C) . Generally, no excessive cytopathic effect of host cells was observed. The time point when viral replication remains high is often regarded as the optimal time for proteomic analysis 23,25 .

The iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technique has been applied to studies of virus-host interactions, which include porcine circovirus type 2 21 , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 22 , porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 23 , bluetongue virus 24 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus 25 . Until now, the mechanisms of PRV pathogenesis and the interaction between PRV and porcine cells have not been fully understood. It is well Functional classification of differentially expressed proteins. These 466 differentially expressed proteins were classified into 23 groups based on their function by COG annotation. The top four groups containing more than 34 proteins were post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones; energy production and conversion; general function prediction only and translation; and ribosomal structure and biogenesis ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary file 3). To further extend the molecular characterization of the differentially expressed proteins, the Gene Ontology and UniProt databases were searched, and these proteins were assigned into their different biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary file 4). For biological process annotation, proteins were mainly involved in cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process and response to stimulus. Among the proteins related to metabolic process, tricarboxylic acid cycle was most significantly enriched (p = 3.81E-10). The cellular component annotation revealed that these proteins were well distributed in different cell components, and there were 257 differentially expressed proteins, with the most significant p value (3.49E-15) being located in the membrane. The major functional categories were binding, catalytic activity, structural molecule activities and transporter activity. In particular, unfolded protein binding (p = 5.50E-09) was most significantly enriched ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary file 4). The KEGG database was used to identify the pathway involvement of these differentially expressed proteins with most proteins being involved in a metabolic pathway. The upregulated proteins were mainly involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The pathways associated with downregulated proteins were related to cell adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, tight junction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary file 5).",

            "text": "The proliferation of virus in cells requires energy and small molecule metabolites, including ATP, NADH, NADPH and the carbon used for the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates 31 . In this study, 83 differentially expressed proteins (17.8%) were classified into metabolic pathways. These proteins were mainly involved in the citrate (TCA) cycle as well as glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism. Fifteen of 17 proteins in the TCA cycle, all 9 proteins in pyruvate metabolism and 8 of 13 proteins in glycolysis were upregulated (Supplementary Figure) . These data demonstrate that PRV utilized energy from the host cell to proliferate through the hijacking of host cell metabolic processes. Similarly, as a member of the herpesvirus family, HCMV can activate the TCA cycle and glycolysis simultaneously allowing the carbons from glucose to be delivered to the TCA cycle to produce fatty acids. In contrast, HSV-1 activates pyruvate carboxylase to induce pyrimidine biosynthesis 32 .The mechanisms of virus-host metabolic interplay warrant further study, especially in how the key genes involved in metabolic pathways can regulate viral infection, because these studies provide novel targets for antiviral drug discovery through metabolic pathway inhibitors. The key enzymes in metabolic pathways that were upregulated after PRV infection are involved in the gene expression regulation system; therefore, incorporating systems analysis, including transcriptomic 33 , proteomic 8 , and metabolomic data, could help to gain a better understanding of this specific mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical for protein synthesis and maturation. ER reside on many molecular chaperones that assist protein folding and assembly 34 . Numerous studies show that viral infections can alter endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activate the unfolded-protein response (UPR), thereby facilitating viral replication [35] [36] [37] [38] . In the current study, 21 of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, all of the 21 proteins were upregulated (Supplementary Figure) . Among these were the heat shock proteins hsp 90-beta (hsp90ab1), 90 kDa beta member 1(hsp90b1), 70 kDa protein 5(hspa5) and 105 kDa (hsph1). Similarly, hsp27 was also significant altered at 4 h of PRV infction in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells using SILAC mass spectrometry methods, since only a small number of host cell proteins changed during early stages of PRV infection, other stress-related proteins did not show significant variations 7, 8 . Heat-shock proteins can facilitate protein folding, heat-shock response activation might be a virus-specific function ensuring proper protein synthesis and; therefore, ER stress proteins may also be important for virus replication 37, 39, 40 . Hsp90 is involved in the assembly and nuclear transport of viral RNA polymerase subunits and facilitates viral replication in HIV-1, Ebola virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Rotavirus [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Previous research has shown that hsp90 can interact with acetylated \u03b1 -tubulin to promote nuclear transport of HSV-1 capsid protein and interact with the HBV reverse transcriptase to facilitate the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that is required early in replication 47, 48 . Thus, hsp90 can be targeted using inhibitors to resist viral infections 49, 50 . Similarly, hspa5 is an essential target for a viral infection, such as Ebola virus 51 . Some other upregulated ER-stress proteins, such as calreticulin and calnexin, that are important for calcium storage and protein folding 52 , also play an important role in viral infections. Calreticulin is induced during HBV infection and can enhance HBV replication by antagonizing the IFN pathway 53 . Calnexin can directly bind to mature S protein and result in conferred infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 54 . Thus, these upregulated proteins may also play an important role in PRV replication, and further research is required to investigate the function of these proteins during PRV infection.",

We speculate that PRV would utilize the host cell protein synthesis system to produce a large number of viral proteins after entry into the cell. Among these proteins, 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) was detected and showed significant changes in the early stages of infection by PRV in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells 8 . Several DNA helicase complexes required for the process of DNA replication including the minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM2, MCM4 and MCM6) were downregulated in the PRV-infected cells. Similarly, nuclear accumulation of MCM4 and MCM6 was reduced in HSV-1-infected human epithelial larynx carcinoma HEp-2 cells 55 . MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7 subunits bind tightly with MCM2, causing a reduced affinity to form the MCM core complex that acts as a DNA helicase in the unwinding of cellular dsDNA 56, 57 . Herpesviruses including PRV contain their own helicases essential for the formation and elongation of the replication fork in viral replication 1,58-60 . Therefore, we speculate that PRV hijack cellular components involved in host cell replication and promote viral genome replication. However, another critical host replication factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was upregulated in PRV-infected cells. PCNA is a clamp that acts as a processivity factor in DNA replication and is required for HSV-1 replication and histone deposition 61, 62 . Taken together, these data indicate that PRV targets multiple proteins involved in host cell replication and translation, and the function of these proteins in PRV infection needs to be further investigated.",

The host shutoff protein pUL41 of HSV-1 can preferentially degrade mRNA containing AU-rich elements 8, 64 .

Samples were chromatographed using a 90 min gradient from 2-30% (mobile phase A 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile; mobile phase B 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 95% (v/v) acetonitrile) after direct injection onto a 20 \u03bc m PicoFrit emitter (New Objective) packed to 12 cm with Magic C18 AQ 3 \u03bc m 120 \u00c5 stationary phase. MS1 spectra were collected in the range 350-1,500 m/z for 250 ms. The 20 most intense precursors with charge state 2-5 were selected for fragmentation, and MS2 spectra were collected in the range 50-2,000 m/z for 100 ms; precursor ions were excluded from reselection for 15 s. Data analysis. The original MS/MS file data were submitted to ProteinPilot Software (version 4.5, AB Sciex) for data analysis. MS/MS data were searched against Sus scrofa UniProt database (March 9, 2016, containing 35,303 sequences, http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000008227). The following search parameters were used: the instrument was TripleTOF 5600, iTRAQ quantification, cysteine modified with iodoacetamide; biological modifications were selected as ID focus, the Quantitate, trypsin digestion, Bias Correction and Background Correction was checked for protein quantification and normalization. For false discovery rate (FDR) calculation, an automatic decoy database search strategy 77 was used to estimate FDR using the PSPEP (Proteomics System Performance Evaluation Pipeline Software) algorithm. Only proteins with at least one unique peptide and unused value more than 1.3 were considered for further analysis. Among the identified peptides, some were excluded from the quantitative analysis for one of the following reasons. (1) The peaks corresponding to the iTRAQ labels were not detected. (2) The peptides were identified with low identification confidence. (3) The peptides were claimed by more than one protein. (4) The S/N (signal-to-noise ratio) for any peptide ratio was too low. (5) Peptides had a combined feature probability < 30% because of semitryptic peptides, peptides missing an iTRAQ reagent label, peptides with low probability modifications and peptides with large delta masses. For protein abundance ratios measured using iTRAQ after normalization, we specifically used ratios with p value < 0.05, and only fold changes > 1.5 or < 0.667 were considered significant. Bioinformatics analysis. The identified and differentially expressed proteins sequences were mapped with Gene Ontology Terms (http://geneontology.org/). A homology search was first performed for all the identified sequences with a localized NCBI BLASTP program against NCBInr animal database. The e-value was set to less than 1e-5, and the best hit for each query sequence was taken into account for GO term matching. The GO term matching was performed with blast2go v4.5 pipeline 78 . Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins System (COG, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) was employed for the functional annotation of genes from new genomes and for research into genome evolution. Pathway analyses were conducted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) platform. The pathway enrichment statistics were performed by Fisher' s exact test, and those with a corrected p value < 0.05 were considered the most significant pathways. Western blot analysis. The infected and mock-infected cells were collected at 24 hpi. Equivalent amounts of cell lysates from each sample were mixed with 5 \u00d7 sample loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies specific for \u03b2 -Actin (4967, Cell Signaling Technology), beta-catenin (51067-2-AP), STAT1 (10144-2-AP), GRB2 (10254-2-AP) and PCNA (60097-1-Ig) purchased from Proteintech Group. Membranes were then washed with TBST three times and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (Proteintech Group) for 1 h at ambient temperature. Finally, protein bands were visualized by addition of the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo, Rockford, IL) reagent.",
