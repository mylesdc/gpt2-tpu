The current study aims to assess the main determinants of functional disability of these patients during the follow-up. Fifty-six influenza A (H7N9) survivors were investigated during the 2-year after discharge from the hospital. Results show interstitial change and fibrosis on pulmonary imaging remained 6 months after hospital discharge. Both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved, but restrictive and obstructive patterns on ventilation function test persisted throughout the follow-up period. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome lung functions improved faster during the first six months. Role-physical and Role-emotional domains in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were worse than those of a sex-and age-matched general population group. The quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than those with no ARDS. Our findings suggest that pulmonary function and imaging findings improved during the first 6 months especially for those with ARDS, however longterm lung disability and psychological impairment in H7N9 survivors persisted at 2 years after discharge from the hospital.",

H7N9 viruses can cause severe illnesses in persons with contact to poultry, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high case fatality rates 2,4 . As of August 31, 2016, a total of 795 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus had been reported in China 4 . The infections were also detected in the travelers of Canada (two) and Malaysia (one) to China 4 . Although the clinical features of hospitalized patients with H7N9 virus infection are generally similar to those of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 5 or H5N1 virus infections 6 , the mortality rates of H7N9 and H5N1 have been reported to be 37.1% and 53.2%, respectively 7 , whereas that of H1N1 was <1% 5 .",

Similarly, patients with ARDS had higher reported acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores (APACH II) than the patients without ARDS.

The mean and 95% CI of parameters of lung function over time are plotted in Fig. 3 . Estimated longitudinal effects on lung function from the mixed-effects regression models are shown in Table 2 . We observed general increases in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), DLCO and forced vital capacity (FVC) for patients regardless of ARDS status. However, patients without ARDS consistently achieved higher FEV1, DLCO and FVC scores over the study period (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ). The ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity score (FEV1/FVC) declined over the follow-up period, and was higher in ARDS patients than patients without ARDS (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ). The estimated improvement in FEV1 for ARDS patients was10.54 (p = 0.00133), 16 .28 (p < 0.01), 17.80 (p < 0.01), and 20.64 (p < 0.01) at the 3-, 6-, 12-and 24-month follow-up assessments compared to 1-month follow-up, respectively. For non-ARDS patients, the estimated improvement in FEV1 was smaller ( Table 2) . The results were similar for other measures, such as FVC, DLCO, and FEV1/FEV. Quality of life. The scores for all domains of the SF-36 did not change significantly from 3 to 24 months after discharge from the hospital. Because the patients were residents in and near Hangzhou, so we chose the SF-36 results of the residents in Hangzhou as the control surveyed by Wang, Li et al. 9 . The scores for role-physical (RP) and role-emotional (RE) domains were significantly lower than those of the control population during the first year 9 . RP remained lower than that of the controls, but there was no difference in RE at the 24-month follow-up. Social functioning (SF) and body pain (BP) were both lower than those of the controls; a significant difference was detected in the former at the 6-month follow-up and in the latter at the 12-and 24-month follow-up visits ( Table 3 ). The mean and 95% CI of parameters of quality of life over time are plotted in Fig. 4 . Generally, patients with no ARDS reported higher scores on all the domains of quality of life except for RE, which were comparable between patients with ARDS and patients without ARDS across the study period.",

The development of refractory hypoxemia is the usual cause of death 2 . However, there are no previous reports on the quality of life of H7N9 patients after hospital discharge. Our study found that more than half of the survivors of H7N9 virus infection had respiratory tract manifestations after discharge from the hospital. Most symptoms improved within 1 month (data not shown). Six months after discharge, more than 80% of patients had returned to work, and the percentage of abnormal DLCO was lowest. Psychological impairment persisted throughout the follow-up period. All survivors were found to have lung involvement on HRCT images, possibly due to diffuse alveolar damage with proteinaceous exudates, occasional cytomegaly, and intra-alveolar hemorrhage 10 . Imaging showed improvement in inflammation over time, especially during the first 6 months after hospital discharge. However, no further significant changes in interstitial fibrosis or ground-glass opacities were detected at the 12-and 24-month visits. An autopsy study of patients with H7N9 infection suggested that lung histology varied according to the duration of illness. After acute diffuse alveolar damage, post-inflammatory changes such as pulmonary pneumocyte hyperplasia and parenchyma fibroproliferation occurred during the later course of the disease 10 . We speculate that changes during the 6-month convalescence period are irreversible. Absorption occurred slowly and was coincident with clinical symptoms. In survivors of H5N1 virus infection, radiologic abnormalities including ground-glass opacities with a reticular pattern remained evident at the 12-month follow-up visit 10 . Moreover, in a study of the long-term outcomes of pandemic 2009 H1N1-associated severe ARDS, the patients also had abnormal imaging findings, with mildly distorted septal lines, parenchymal bands, pneumatocele and distal bronchiectasis, at 1 year post-ICU discharge 11 . At the 3-month visit, ground-glass opacities were evident in 85.7% of patients 5 . These features are generally similar to those of survivors of H7N9 infection in this study.",

In our study, approximately half of the survivors had ventilation dysfunction at 24 months. Hybrid patterns and restrictive ventilation dysfunction accounted for most types of dysfunction, which may be caused by muscle weakness and fatigue 13 . 78.9% of patients exhibited decreased DLCO levels at the 1-year follow-up visit, which was higher than reported previously [14] [15] [16] [17] .

When they went back home, they not only lacked of activities, but also were isolated by their relatives and neighbors because H7N9 attack made people fear of infection and death. Thus survivors have significantly lower HRQoL than that of the general population and are likely to have social functioning and mental health deficits 19 . Similarly, H7N9 survivors experience persistent HRQoL decrements after discharge. Thus, the disease affected HRQoL mainly in the RP, BP, SF, and RE domains compared with normal controls. A meta-analysis showed that recovery in the HRQoL of ARDS survivors occurred during the first 6 months after discharge 20 , but no significant improvement was evident at the 2-year follow-up in our study. These findings suggest that the quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than that of those without ARDS. The severity of the diseases may influence the quality of life the patients.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of the physical and psychological health status of patients with influenza A(H7N9) pneumonia during the convalescent period. This study had several limitations. First, most H7N9 infections occurred in China between 2013 and the present. This was a single-center study involving a limited number of patients over a 1-year period in Zhejiang Province, China. Second, follow-up visits were offered to all patients discharged from the hospital, but some refused to attend and some did not complete follow up. The follow-up rates for LFT were 76%, 71%, 75% and 37% and those for HRQoL were 69%, 78%, 75% and 37% at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Although many indices did not change significantly after 1 year, the study population may not be representative of the entire population of H7N9 survivors. Third, this was a prospective study on the impact of H7N9 on the physical and psychological health of survivors. However, no information on the baseline lung function and quality of life of these patients was available. Although some patients may have underlying pulmonary diseases, most of them received the medicine without further examination. So we cannot compare the index of lung function before and post infection of H7N9. In particular, this group of patients had pre-existing conditions, which may also have affected the HRQoL results. Patients who had suffered acute pathologies reported significant decreases in quality of life, whereas other patients with pre-existing conditions reported significant improvements in terms of reduced BP and improved MH, VT and SF scores 21 . In our study, H7N9 survivors had significantly higher VT and MH scores than the population norms. Thus, those scores may have been higher at baseline, i.e., prior to admission. Finally, after discharge from the hospital, there was no significant improvement; however, whether improvements in physical and mental health would have been detected had the follow-up duration been longer is unknown. Thus, further expanded research is needed.",

The models also included a first-order autoregressive covariance structure to account for repeated measures within each patient.
