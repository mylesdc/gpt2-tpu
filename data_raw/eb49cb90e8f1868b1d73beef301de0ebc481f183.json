Baculoviruses are utilized for the high level production of recombinant proteins in insect cells [1, 2] and the gene transduction to mammalian cells both in vivo and in vitro as a foreign gene delivery vectors [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, budded baculoviruses are applied for displaying the recombinant proteins on their surface for antibody production, functional analysis of receptors and vaccine production [5] [6] [7] . More recently, an increasing number of investigators have challenged the use of baculovirus for gene therapy applications [8] . The preparation of modified baculovirus vectors which are able to direct gene expression in mammalian cells represents a safer alternative over classical mammalian viruses. In order to use baculoviruses in gene therapy, the development of efficient production process towards high-titer preparation is required, because of low baculovirus transduction efficiency in mammalian cells compared to other viral delivery system, e.g. retroviruses.",

Recombinant BmNPV-CP -/bx-GGT2 stock [15] , whose titer was determined by end-point dilution method, was diluted and its baculovirus DNA was extracted from each diluted baculovirus DNA solution by High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics K. K.). The cross point for each elute, containing baculovirus DNA, was determined by Q-PCR. As the number of cycle increased, the fluorescent intensity increased in all samples except for a negative control (Figure 1A) . No DNA amplification was observed for negative control containing 6 \u03bcl of water instead of baculovirus DNA. The melting curves of amplified DNA fragment by Q-PCR were analyzed. Single peaks were observed at approximately 82\u00b0C, indicating that DNA fragments were amplified specifically by forward and reverse primers without any unspecific binding ( Figure 1B ). Standard calibration curve of cross points vs. virus titer is shown in Figure 1C . This result confirms that corresponding cross points and determined titers were correlated linearly with a correlation efficiency of 0.99.

Surprisingly, 72 pfu/ larva (30 \u03bcl of rBmNPV-hPRR solution containing 2.38 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/ml) was enough to infect all silkworm larvae. Even the 1:10 5 -diluted hemolymph was still found to be infectious to silkworm larvae. When 30 \u03bcl of 2.38 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/ml rBmNPV-hPRR (7.2 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/larva) was injected, the highest baculovirus titer (4.50 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/ml) was obtained for 5 days breeding ( Figure 2A ).

Therefore, when 2.38 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/ ml baculovirus solution was injected, total baculovirus number in hemolymph was found to be the highest (9.45 \u00d7 10 8 pfu/larva) ( Figure 2B ).",

Especially in the case of AcMNPV, SYBR Green I was adopted for Q-PCR and a correlation between titers determined by end-point dilution and Q-PCR has been observed. However, in the case of BmNPV titer determination, the method was dependent only on conventional plaque assay and end-point dilution method only, until now. In this study, we established the Q-PCR titer determination method for BmNPV. The melting point of amplified fragment from BmNPV DNA was 82\u00b0C, but the melting point of amplified fragment from AcMNPV DNA was approximately 86\u00b0C. Identity in DNA sequence between the two fragments is 95.8%. The difference between two melting points is supposed to result from the difference between the nucleotide sequences of the respective two fragments.",

Baculovirus infection was not observed using transfection solution as baculovirus solution, indicating that it is difficult for the amount of rBmNPV-hPRR in transfection solution to infect Bm5 cells in normal condition due to a very small amount of baculovirus titer. This implies that many amplification steps are a prerequisite towards a successful infection of Bm5 cells. It takes at least a month to amplify baculoviruses up to a sufficient titer. Using hemolymph as a baculovirus stock to increase baculovirus titer can thus save time, cost and labor. In this report, the maximum baculovirus titer of hemolymph from BmNPV-infected silkworm larvae was found to be 4.50 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/ml. Sephacryl S-1000 SF column is more appropriate for the purification of BmNPV from larval hemolymph than Superdex 200 10/300 GL column, because of its efficiency in removal of contaminant proteins. In the case of purification of Lily symptomless virus from fresh infected-tissues of Lanzhou lily, Sephadex-200 HR was superior to Sephacryl S-1000 method [25] . In this study, Sephadex-200 HR also was found to be superior to Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography in the baculovirus recovery, but purification yield was one-third to that with Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography.

Moreover, hPRR which is expressed in the envelope was observed at 5 days p.i., but not 4 days p.i. Electron micrographs revealed that purified rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph at 5 days p.i. possessed thick envelopes, resulting in low purification efficiency of rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph at 5 days p.i.. The increase of envelope proteins in rBmNPV-hPRR of larval hemolymph at 5 days p.i. was caused by thick envelopes around rBmNPV-hPRR particles. Besides, it was previously reported that increase of mutant virus, defective interfering baculoviruses (DIs), which lacks considerable parts of its genome, was observed during serial passage of AcMNPV in insect cells [29, 30] and the large deletion of its genome may be caused by several hetero-and homologous recombination mechanism [31] . DIs of BmNPV was also found in cultured cells [32] . DIs might not be detected by Q-PCR titer measurement method because of the large deletion of its genome, probably the loss of ie-1 gene. It is suggested that DIs, which missed ie-1 gene, increased in hemolymph during BmNPV infection and therefore quantity of rBmNPV-hPRR per mg of protein decreased at 5 day p.i.",

Purification of rBm-NPV-hPRR from silkworm larval hemolymph was successfully implemented by Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography. The purified rBmNPV-hPRR showed that the hPRR was displayed on the surface of rBmNPV.
