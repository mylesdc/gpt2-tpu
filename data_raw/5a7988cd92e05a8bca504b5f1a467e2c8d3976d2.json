            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB), an air-borne infectious disease, is a major public-health problem in China. The reported number of the active tuberculosis cases is about one million each year. The morbidity data for 2005-2012 reflect that the difference in morbidity based on age group is significant, thus the role of age-structure on the transmission of TB needs to be further developed. In this work, based on the reported data and the observed morbidity characteristics, we propose a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model with age groupings, involving three categories: children, the middle-aged, and senior to investigate the role of age on the transmission of tuberculosis in Mainland China from 2005 to 2016. Then, we evaluated the parameters by the Least Square method and simulated the model and it had good alignment with the reported infected TB data in Mainland China. Furthermore, we estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 of 1.7858, with an obtained 95% confidence interval for R 0 of (1.7752, 1.7963) by Latin hypercube sampling, and we completed a sensitivity analysis of R 0 in terms of some parameters. Our study demonstrates that diverse age groups have different effects on TB. Two effective measures were found that would help reach the goals of the World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy: an increase in the recovery rate and the reduction in the infectious rate of the senior age group. and the WHO's short course chemotherapy strategy, TB remains a major cause of illness and death in most high-incidence countries.",

Attributed to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb and the spread of HIV/AIDS, the TB burden in China has increased over the past two decades [3] . Meanwhile, according to the United Nations, as a result of the one-child policy and low mortality, China is ageing more rapidly than almost any other country [4] . From the morbidity statistics from 2005 to 2012, shown in Figure 1 , we know that the difference in morbidity between different age groups is remarkable: the morbidity of the 0-14 age group is the lowest and that of the 60 and older age group is the highest, while the morbidity of the 15-59 age group is in between. However, the role of this age grouping pattern in the transmission of TB in China is not yet clear. Therefore, we wanted to identify the potential effect of age on the morbidity for the transmission of TB in China, which could help provide effective control strategies for diverse sub-populations.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne infective disease caused by the slowly-replicating bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Person-to-person transmission of Mtb occurs via the respiratory system, which can happen through both close contact between people and through infectious bacilli being carried throughout buildings by air currents [1] . According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2013 [2] , an estimated 8.6 million new cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths, including 320,000 deaths among HIV-positive people, were recorded in 2012. Approximately 80% of all new TB cases in the world occur in 22 high burden countries that have incidence rates from 59 to 1003 per 100,000 people. India and China have the largest number of cases at 26% and 12% of the global total, respectively. Despite widespread implementation of control measures, including the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination, antiretroviral therapy, antimicrobial chemotherapy, Mathematical modeling has become a powerful tool for analyzing epidemiological characteristics [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Different models have been developed for defining target sub-populations for treating latent TB infections and incorporating certain factors, such as drug-resistant strains, co-infection with HIV, relapse, re-infection, and vaccination, to study the transmission dynamics of TB [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In particular, Blower et al. [10] proposed a simple TB transmission model and presented a theoretical framework for assessing the intrinsic TB transmission dynamics. Bhunuet et al. [14] considered a TB model incorporated the treatment of infectives and chemoprophylaxis. Liu et al. [19] studied a TB model incorporating seasonality. Huynh et al. [24] developed an individual-based computational model to explore the trajectory of the TB burden if the DOTS strategy is maintained or if new interventions are introduced. A more detailed discussion on different TB models was completed by White and Garnett [25] . However, few works have used mathematical models with age groupings to study the transmission of TB in China. In this paper, based on the reported data and the observed morbidity characteristics, we created a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model with age groups of childhood, middle-aged, and senior, to investigate the role of age on the transmission process and evaluate feasible control strategies to reach the goals outlined in the WHO End TB Strategy. We estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 , analyzed the globally dynamic behavior of the model, and used the model to simulate the annual data of infected TB cases reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from 2005 to 2016. Finally, we completed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of R 0 , and explored some effective and targeted control measures for the transmission of TB in China. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the data collection; formulate the TB model; obtain the theoretical results, such as existence and uniqueness of the solution; and define the basic reproduction ratio R 0 and global stability of disease-free equilibrium. In Section 3, data fitting and sensitivity analysis of R 0 are shown, and the feasibility of the WHO End TB Strategy is assessed. A brief discussion ensues in Section 4.",

Based on the observation that the morbidity among diverse age groups is significantly different (Figure 1 ), to explore the role of age on the infection pattern between susceptible and infectious classes, the susceptible class was further divided into three age groups: childhood (S 1 ), middle-aged (S 2 ), and senior (S 3 ). We also assumed that the latent, infectious, and recovered classes are the same for different age groups. Since the latent TB cases, which are individuals who have been infected by TB bacteria but are asymptomatic, and cured TB cases may not directly cause death [26], we assumed that the death rate of the latent and recovered classes were related to the natural death rate d. Additionally, for infectious class, we added the term \u00b5, based on natural death rate d, to describe the deaths caused by TB infection. Our assumptions for the dynamic transmission of TB in China with age groupings are demonstrated in Figure 2 . The model we created has the compartmental structure of the classical SEIR epidemic model, and is described by the following differential equations:",

Subsequently, China increased high-quality directly observed treatment, short course chemotherapy (DOTS) [24] , and a compulsory Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) immunization program for newborns [27] . These actions helped to effectively control the increase of TB in China. Given this, and based on Model (1), we considered two kinds of control strategies for TB in China: the incremental recovery rate per year due to DOTS, \u03be (0 < \u03be < 1), and the immunity rate of the BCG vaccine, \u03d5 (0 < \u03d5 < 1).

Then, using the fourth-order and five-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (ode45 function), which is a powerful tool for solving ordinary differential equations, according to the corresponding parameters of Model (2) listed in Table 2 , we simulated the data of the cumulative number and reported cases of TB infection from 2005 to 2016. Meanwhile, by random sampling of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the parameters, we further plotted the 95% CI of the trajectories of the TB infection data, both cumulative and newly-infected TB cases, based on 2000 independent repeated simulations of Model (2) (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4 shows both the time evolution of infection cases and a comparison with the empirical records of TB infection cases, and also shows the 95% percent interval for all 3000 passing simulation trajectories. Moreover, we calculated the residual of 2016 as 235 and R-square (R 2 ) statistic to show goodness of fit [34] , where the R-square value is 0.9812. We also observed that the actual reported TB infection data almost fell into the 95% CI of our simulation trajectories. Thus, our simulation results are in good accordance with the reported TB infection data, both cumulative and newly-infected TB cases, from the CDC in China from 2005 to 2016. Model (2) had a better predictive performance. In addition, to evaluate the TB burden of China based on our model, according to the definition of incidence that the number of new and relapse cases of TB arising in a given time period, usually one year, we can further translate the reported infected TB cases into the incidence rate of TB. For comparison, we also plot the global TB incidence and the estimated TB incidence of WHO from 2005 to 2015. Figure 5 shows that after 2008, the TB incidence is lower than that of estimated value by WHO, which may implies that China substantial accelerate the control effects of TB. Moreover, we can observed that the TB incidence of China is far below the global level. ",

Since the LHS requires assigning a probability density function (PDF) to each of the parameters, we stratified the PDFs into 3000 equiprobability areas and then independently randomly sampled 3000 times without replacement, forming 3000 input parameter vectors [21] .These input parameter vectors were then used to calculate the numerical distribution of the basic reproduction number R 0 . With the simulated parameter values, we obtained the numerical distribution of the basic reproduction number R 0 (see Figure 6 ), and estimated the basic reproduction number from 2005 to 2016 is R 0 = 1.7858 and the 95% confidence interval of R 0 is (1.7752, 1.7963 ). For the sensitivity analysis of R 0 , we can calculate partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC), which reflects the correlation between parameters A, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 , m 1 , m 2 , \u03b3, \u03b7 and R 0 . The PRCC of the estimated parameters with respect to R 0 are listed in Table 3 . It follows from Table 3 that there exist a positive correlation between A, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 , m 1 , \u03b7 and R 0 , and a negative correlation between m 2 , \u03b3 and R 0 . Furthermore, we can obtain that PRCC(A) > PRCC(\u03b3) > PRCC(\u03bb 3 ) > PRCC(m 2 , \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03b7, m 1 ) , namely, A, \u03b3, \u03bb 3 play the most important role to determine R 0 .

To examine the TB controlling effects with respect to \u03b3 and \u03bb 3 , we examined if reaching the WHO End TB Strategy would be feasible based on the current different control strategies. We used the parameter values listed in Table 2 as a baseline to compare the control effects. First, we only considered the single intervention scenario including \u03bb 3 , and, as shown in Figure 7a , we would not be able to reach the goal of WHO End TB Strategy under the current plan, even with decreasing \u03bb 3 by 50%. Then, we considered the single intervention scenario of \u03b3, and as shown in Figure 7b , 15% increasing of the baseline \u03b3 would allow us to reach the WHO target. Finally, we considered an integrated control strategy including both \u03b3 and \u03bb 3 simultaneously. Figure 7c shows that if we can reduce the morbidity in the senior group \u03bb 3 by 15%, and increase the recovery rate \u03b3 by 10%, then we will meet the TB End Target. Therefore, we concluded that, by using the current TB control interventions, China may not reach the WHO End TB Strategy in 2025. To achieve the WHO End TB Strategy goal, China will need to pay more attention to enhance their combination TB interventions and further explore the feasibility of additional control strategies. ",

Importantly, significant differences exist among different age groups in terms of the morbidity of TB. Taking this into account, and using the reported TB data in China from 2005 to 2016, we proposed a SEIR epidemic model with three age groups, children, middle-aged, and senior, to study the transmission of tuberculosis in China. By means of the Least Square method, we evaluated the parameters and simulated the model, and the model agrees well with the annual reported TB data in China. Furthermore, we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 \u2248 1.7858, and obtain the 95% confidence interval for R 0 is about (1.7752, 1.7963) by Latin hypercube sampling.

Based on the age-structuring model, more risk factors for different age groups can be identified. Interventions could be targeted toward specific groups, which would be particularly effective as an epidemic control measure [38] . Thus, the age grouping pattern provides a meaningful scheme, based upon the treatment of active cases and the chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals, to define targeted sub-populations for treating TB infections. For instance, the BCG vaccine is useful only for younger people but is less effective for the middle-or the senior-aged groups, having an average efficacy of only about 50% for those groups [2, 39] . However, with the aging of the Chinese population and high morbidity rate of TB in seniors, perhaps an analogue of the BCG vaccine control strategy should be implemented for the potentially high-risk senior sub-population, which may result in the decreasing the morbidity in that group. In addition, the nationwide DOTS program should be more focused on the senior-aged group, such as providing more financial assistance for this group, who may experience catastrophic costs due to TB [26] , and should place more emphasis on the people with latent TB in middle-aged group, who may increase the proportion of the actively infected people in the senior group.",

Thus, two important indexes must be improved: First, the TB treatment success rate and treatment coverage (increasing \u03b3), for example, by providing high-quality TB care to prevent suffering and death from TB. Second, monitoring and detecting the latent TB in the senior population (reducing \u03bb 3 ) may help prevent the development of active TB in those already infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including further strengthening the public health facilities and providing an isolation policy for those with detected latent TB.

Due to the influence of drug-resistant strains, co-infection with other diseases including HIV, diabetes mellitus, etc., and increasing infection opportunities that accompanies world travel, TB will be weakly persistent and should show an overall decreasing trend in the future (see Figure 7) . shows that if we can reduce the morbidity of the senior group by 15%, and increase the recovery rate by 10% , then we could potentially achieve the WHO TB End Target.

Proof of the Positively Invariant SetAdding the first five equations in Model (2), we haved(S 1 +S 2 +S 3 +E+I+R) dt = A \u2212 d 1 S 1 \u2212 d 2 S 2 \u2212 d 3 S 3 \u2212 dE \u2212 \u03d5\u03bb 1 S 1 I \u2212 (d + \u00b5)I \u2212 dR \u2264 A \u2212d(S 1 + S 2 + S 3 + E + I + R), whered = min{d 1 , d 2 , d 3 , d, d + \u00b5}.It follows from the above equation that lim supt\u2192\u221e (S 1 + S 2 + S 3 + E + I + R) \u2264 \u00c2 d . (A1)Thus, we can obtain the following positively invariant set of Model(2):\u2126 = (S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , E, I, R) S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , E, I, R \u2265 0, 0 \u2264 S 1 + S 2 + S 3 + E + I + R \u2264 \u00c2 d .Appendix A.2. Proof of the Existence of Positive Steady StateBy a simple calculation, we have from (6) thatS 1 = A d 1 + m 1 + \u03bb 1 I , S 2 = m 1 A (d 1 + m 1 + \u03bb 1 I)(d 2 + m 2 + \u03bb 2 I) , S 3 = m 1 m 2 A (d 1 + m 1 + \u03bb 1 I)(d 2 + m 2 + \u03bb 2 I)(d 3 + \u03bb 3 I)",
