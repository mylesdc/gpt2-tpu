            "text": "An exacerbated immune response is one of the main causes of influenza-induced lung damage during infection. The molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of the initial immune response to infection, either as a protective response or as detrimental immunopathology, are not well understood. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor expressed on immune cells that has been implicated in induction and maintenance of excessive inflammation. Here, we analyze the role of this receptor in a mouse model of influenza virus infection using a receptor knockout (KO) mouse strain. Our results demonstrate that the absence of the P2X7 receptor results in a better outcome to influenza virus infection characterized by reduced weight loss and increased survival upon experimental influenza challenge compared to wild-type mice. This effect was not virus strain specific. Overall lung pathology and apoptosis were reduced in virusinfected KO mice. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425), and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) was also reduced in the lungs of the infected KO mice. Infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b \u03e9 macrophages, characteristic of severe influenza virus infection in mice, were lower in the KO animals. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the P2X7 receptor is involved in the exacerbated immune response observed during influenza virus infection. IMPORTANCE A hallmark of influenza virus infection is the development of lung pathology induced by an exacerbated immune response. The mechanisms shared by the antiviral host defense required for viral clearance and those required for development of immunopathology are not clearly understood. Purinergic receptors, and in particular the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7r), are involved in activation of the immune response. We used mice lacking the P2X7r (P2X7r KO mice) to better understand the mechanisms that lead to development of lung pathology during influenza virus infection. In our studies, we observed that P2X7r KO mice developed less lung immunopathology and had better survival than the wild-type mice. These results implicate P2X7r in the induction of an exacerbated local immune response to influenza virus and help us to better understand the mechanisms leading to the lung immunopathology observed during severe viral infections.",

The amount of replicating virus in the lungs is thought to correlate with the degree of lung pathology. Therefore, we infected wild-type and P2X7r KO mice with NL/09 virus, and at 4 or 7 days after infection, the lungs were harvested, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Reduced virus titers were observed in the lungs of the P2X7r KO mice compared to the wild-type mice, particularly in the samples collected on day 7 postinfection, although these differences were not statistically significant (P \u03ed 0.1) (Fig. 3A) . In a different set of mice, the lungs were collected on day 4 postinfection, and representative sections were prepared for histopathology. In both groups of mice, lesions were characterized as bronchointerstitial pneumonia, although the severity of the lesions differed in the groups (P \u03fd 0.05) ( Table 1 ). In the lungs of the virus-infected P2X7r KO mice, the bronchiolar region showed mild to moderate epithelial degeneration, characterized by vacuolation and multifocal necrosis of individual epithelial cells with a thin layer of peribronchiolar inflammatory cells, and moderate perivascular inflammation with little to no presence of intraluminal debris (Fig. 3B) . The bronchiolar region of the lungs from wild-type mice exhibited a marked epithelial degeneration characterized by vacuolation, segmental necrosis, and loss of the epithelium, with a thick layer of peribronchiolar inflammatory cells, and mild to marked amounts of intraluminal debris (Fig. 3C) . At the alveolar level, lesions in the KO mice consisted of mild inflammation as well as tissue damage that was characterized by the presence of scattered cell necrosis with mild to moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 3D) . The alveolar region of lungs from wild-type mice exhibited marked alveolar inflammation characterized by multifocal necrosis and marked infiltration by inflammatory cells (Fig. 3E) .",

We observed differences only in cells treated with the P2X7r antagonist AZ11645373. AZ is a potent cyclic imide (50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ], 5 to 10 nM) that selectively inhibits the human P2X7r (36) . In contrast, BBG, the other P2X7r antagonist used in this study, is moderately selective and less potent in blocking the human P2X7r (IC 50 , 200 nM) (37). Since we treated cells with the same concentration of compound (100 M), we speculate that differences in potency may be one of the reasons why we observed some effect in virus growth with one receptor antagonist but not with the other.",

It is generally accepted that survival of the infected host correlates with a reduction of the viral burden in the lung (38, 39) . However, when we quantified the virus titers in the lungs of infected mice, we observed that the virus titers in the lungs of virus-infected KO mice were not significantly different from those in the lungs of virus-infected wild-type mice. This lack of correlation between lung virus titers and severity of disease has been previously reported (6, 40, 41) . In early stages of viral P2X7 Receptor in Influenza Immunopathology \u00ae infection, influenza A virus (IAV) activates antiapoptotic signals to evade the host defense mechanism. However, in the later stages of infection, IAV triggers apoptosis through activation of intrinsic pathways in order to achieve enhanced viral replication and dissemination (42, 43) , contributing to tissue damage. We evaluated apoptosis in lungs at day 4 postinfection in what can be considered late in infection, and we observed reduced numbers of apoptotic cells in the KO mice. Apoptosis can occur through many mechanisms, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines leading to an increased burden of apoptosis of the alveolar epithelium (44) , activation of caspase cascades, including caspase-1, -3, and -8 (45) , and the formation and release of reactive oxygen species (46) . It is interesting that activation of the P2X7 receptor induces some of the aforementioned proapoptotic mechanisms (45, 46) ; therefore, the absence of this receptor is causing a reduction in apoptosis during later stages of infection.",

During the recent H1N1 pandemic, patients with severe disease also had high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (39) . A similar correlation has been observed in animal models of influenza virus infection (49, 50) . In the mouse model of influenza, mice with severe clinical signs that succumb to infection have increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and develop lung immunopathology (50) (51) (52) . In our studies, we observed that the virus-infected P2X7r KO mice had lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u2423, IFN-\u2425, CXCL10, and CCL2 in their lungs at day 3 postinfection. Activation of P2X7 receptors by extracellular ATP plays a central role in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and it plays a role on the regulation of macrophages, neutrophils, and effector T cells, important cell mediators during inflammation (9, 11, 53, 54). Therefore, the lower level of cytokines observed in the lungs of the P2X7r KO mice after influenza virus infection may be explained by the lack of activation of this purinergic signaling pathway in these mice. We observed that IL-10 levels in the lungs of the KO mice infected with PR/8 or NL/09 were lower than those of the WT mice. IL-10 is considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the context of influenza virus infection, and its production relates to reduced immunopathology and increased survival (41) . This discrepancy may be explained by the time when we measured IL-10 in the lungs, since the main contributors to IL-10 production in the context of influenza infection are CD8 \u03e9 effector T cells, a population of cells that is found later in infection (41) . In addition, increased levels of this cytokine early during infection can hinder the activation of the antiviral immune response (53) , suggesting that the increased levels observed in the WT mice early during infection may be detrimental.",

The lack of the receptor in our model does not induce a global reduction in cytokine production after influenza virus infection since we did not observe differences in cytokine levels in serum from the virus-infected KO and WT mice. We also measured the basal levels of IL-1\u2424, IL-6, TNF-\u2423, and CCL5 in the lungs of naive KO and WT mice, and no significant differences were observed (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).

In our studies, we observed a reduction in neutrophil influx to the airways of the KO mice at day 3 postinfection that was also evident during the analysis of the lung histology sections. An exacerbated response with an increased influx of highly proinflammatory neutrophils and the prolonged activation of these cells leads to increased tissue damage and lethality (3, 6, 60) . Purinergic signaling in the presence of high concentrations of extracellular ATP has a critical role in activation of neutrophils for the production of cytokines and in the increased influx and persistence of neutrophils at the site of infection (11) . Furthermore, we observed a significantly smaller amount of CXCL10 in the lungs of KO mice infected with NL/09 or PR/8 influenza virus. This chemokine is an important factor for the chemotaxis and activation (increased oxidative burst) of neutrophils, and high levels in the respiratory tract after influenza virus infection correlate with enhanced pulmonary immunopathology (61) (62) (63) . Together, these results suggest that purinergic signaling through the P2X7 receptor is important for the recruitment and possible activation of neutrophils in the lungs after influenza virus infection.",

These cells can be proinflammatory or immunomodulatory based on the cytokine profile they produce and surface markers they express after activation (1) . Lung accumulation of these inflammatory macrophages with an immunoregulatory phenotype contributes to reduce the development of immunopathology (64) . Furthermore, it has been shown that maintenance of this cell population for a longer time at the site of infection correlates with protection of mice from influenza-induced immunopathology and lethality (65) . The role of the P2X7 receptor in the activation of macrophages has been previously established in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro (8) .

The histopathology analysis of lung sections clearly showed an increased number of infiltrating cells in the lung parenchyma of the virus-infected wild-type mice compared to the virus-infected KO mice. However, further analysis of the infiltrating cells showed that the number of CD11b \u03e9 macrophages (whole lung) and number of activated macrophages (BALF), both associated with protection, were higher in the virus-infected KO mice. Furthermore, activation of the P2X7 receptor can modify the protein secretion profile of stimulated macrophages depending on the activation status of the cells (proinflammatory or immunomodulatory), providing evidence that activation of this pathway may function to fine tune the activity of the heterogeneous population of macrophages observed through infection of the lungs (54) .",

The assays were run using 1,500 beads per set of each of cytokines measured per well in a total volume of 50 l. The plates were read on a Luminex MAGPIX platform. For each bead set, \u03fe50 beads were collected. The median fluorescence intensity of these beads was recorded and used for analysis with the Milliplex software using a 5P regression algorithm.",

Single-cell suspensions were stained in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mM EDTA. Antibodies against the following immune markers were used for discrimination of immune cell types: CD45 (30-F11; BD), CD11b (M1/70; BioLegend), CD11c (HL3; BD), Ly6c (HK1.4; eBioscience), GR1 (RB6-8C5; eBioscience), major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) (M5/ 114.15.2; BD), and SiglecF (E50-2440; BD). Live cells were discriminated from dead cells by using a viability dye eFluor 520 (eBioscience).

Leukocytes recruited to the airway space were collected by lavaging the lungs in situ by slowly injecting 1 ml of cold sterile PBS using an input 3-ml syringe with three-way stopcock and then approximately 1 ml of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from lungs using the output 3-ml syringe. We repeated this procedure three times. Cell number and cell viability were determined using trypan blue and an automatic cell counter (Countess II; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the cytospin, 300 l of each BALF sample containing 1 \u03eb 10 5 cells was spun at 600 rpm for 10 min. The slides were air dried for 2 h and then stained with Diff-Quick. The slides were evaluated in a blind manner by a trained comparative pathologist. Differential cell counts (percentage) were established by counting at least 200 cells at a high magnification (\u03eb600) using the following categorization (69) . Undifferentiated alveolar macrophages were defined as relatively large, round to oval cells with eccentric round to oval nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, while activated macrophages were larger and contain more cytoplasm and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles, with some macrophages binucleated. Neutrophils (10 to 15 m in diameter) were characterized by an eosinophilic cytoplasm and a basophilic lobulated nucleus with violet granules. Inactivated lymphocytes were small (\u03fd10 m) cells with rounded nuclei, dense nuclear chromatin, and little cytoplasm, while activated (reactive) lymphocytes were larger with more basophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Finally, we also quantified the percentage of lysed cells by the relative proportion of isolated (naked) nuclei.",
