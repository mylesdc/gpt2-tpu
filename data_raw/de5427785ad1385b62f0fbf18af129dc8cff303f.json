Indigo-dyed textiles were widely traded along the legendary Silk Road that linked China to Europe. Today, due to the labor-intensive nature of indigo extraction at the household level, lifestyle changes and the widespread availability of commercially produced indigo paste, traditional indigo extraction methods have declined in villages. Yet Li textile weavers on Hainan Island are internationally recognized as producers of indigo-dyed textile using warp ikat techniques. In contrast, Hainan Miao weavers produce indigo-dyed textiles using batik (wax resist) techniques. The aim of this study was to document the indigenous knowledge on indigo-yielding plant species used by both Hainan Miao and Li people on Hainan Island, China. Method: Ethnic uses were documented during three field surveys, through a questionnaire survey of 193 respondents, comprising 144 Hainan Miao and 49 Li traditional dyers. Mention index (QI), Availability index (AI), and Preference ranking (PR) of each indigo-yielding plant species were calculated to screen out plant resources with potential development value.",

            "text": "Results: Five indigo-yielding plant species (from four plant families and four genera) were historically used by Hainan Miao and Li dyers. However, just four species are still in use. Strobilanthes cusia was the main indigo source for Hainan Miao dyers. Li dyers also commonly use Indigofera species (I. tinctoria and I. suffruticosa) for indigo extraction. Wrightia laevis is less commonly used as a contemporary indigo source. Indigo extraction by steeping in water to which lime is added to increase the pH is sharing by the five indigo-yielding plant species. Strobilanthes cusia had the highest QI, AI and PR values in Hainan Miao villages. Indigofera tinctoria had the highest QI and AI values, but Indigofera suffruticosa was preferred by Li dyers. Conclusion: In the process of modernization and urbanization, some Hainan Miao and Li dyers retain the traditional indigo extraction methods. We found that Strobilanthes cusia and Indigofera tinctoria have the most potential for sustainable indigo production in the future. Furthermore, this study documents the details of extraction method from Wrightia laevis for the first time and the use of Ricinus communis seeds in that process. As one of the last places globally where Wrightia laevis is still used for indigo production, the may also be a nice market among textile collectors and museums that keeps the tradition of Wrightia laevis production and use for indigo extraction alive.",

In addition to as natural dyes, indigo is also used as a food colorant and for medicinal use [2] . Historically, indigo is extracted from indigo-yielding plant species. The indigo-yielding plant species were important cash crops on farmers in India, China, Central America, South Carolina, the southern USA, and Indonesia [4, 5] .

It is toxic and the synthesis involves hazardous chemicals [4] . On the contrary, traditional indigo dyes are of plant origin, which exhibits better biodegradability and more sustainable than synthetic counterparts [8] . Recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in the natural dyes in textile research, ecofriendly fashion, and sustainable-production [4, 6] .

For example, Cardon [9] recorded about 20 indigo-yielding plant species (7 families and 9 genera) used globally. Han's study [10] showed that four indigo-yielding plant species (four families and four genera) were mainly used for indigo extraction in Ming (1368-1644 C.E.) and Qing Dynasties (1644-1911 C.E.) in China. However, for some indigo-yielding plant species, apart from a brief mention of use of indigo extraction, there are few contemporary accounts of the indigo extraction methods or how local dyers harvest in China. This knowledge gap needs to be filled before traditional indigo-yielding plant use and extraction methods disappear.",

Interestingly, there is underdifferentiation of the two species (Indigofera suffruticosa and Indigofera tinctoria), which are given the same vernacular name in the study sites. Both of these Indigofera species were called gam za/ging by the Hainan Miao and be fa by the Li dyers. This under-differentiation occurs despite both Hainan Miao and Li dyers being able to distinguish these two plant species on the basis of the different fruit shapes, leaf sizes, and heights of these Indigofera species. Local dyers observed that Indigofera tinctoria has straight fruits, smaller leaves and is around a meter high, while Indigofera suffruticosa has curved fruits, its leaves are bigger, and the plant can grow into a tall bush over 2 m high. However, Strobilanthes cusia was given two vernacular names by Hainan Miao dyers according to the leaf sizes. Those with large leaves that grow under the shadow of trees were called gam luo, while the small ones were called gam dun. Luo means large and dun means small in local Hainan Miao language.",

Li dyers believed that Indigofera suffruticosa (4.88) was preferred according to their experience. Further, it is interesting that Strobilanthes cusia was given the lowest score (3.10) by Li dyers, which was very different from the preference of Hainan Miao dyers. This can be explained by the different environmental conditions of the study sites. The Li study villages are at a lower altitude and are drier, so are less suitable for the growth of Strobilanthes cusia. Only about 20% (n = 10) Li dyers knew how to use Strobilanthes cusia, and this is known through gift exchange. This occurred when Li people who lived near mountain areas brought Strobilanthes cusia as a gift when visiting their relatives.",

We found that both Hainan Miao and Li dyers use the steeping method for five indigo-yielding plant species. The indigo extraction method was shown in Figs. 2 and 3: (1) harvesting: the fresh materials of indigo-yielding plant species are harvested and transported from the field to their homes; (2) fermentation: the materials were bent and left to steep in a cistern and added cool water to completely immerse the materials. Then removed the materials from the fermentation vat when they rotted. This process usually took 2 to 3 days depending on the amount of soaking materials and the weather condition, up to 1 week; (3) oxygenation: lime powder water was added to the fermentation vat, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 0.5 to 1.5 h. When the foam was less and the foam color was blue and reddish, the dyers stop the oxygenation process. (4) Sedimentation: after resting for one or two nights, the blue sediment was on the bottom of the cistern and was called lan dian (\u84dd\u975b) (translation: indigo paste). The lan dian, compacted in paste, will transfer to a small plastics bucket or pot to keep it moist for storage. Moreover, the five indigo-yielding plant species could be mixed in practical production according to the information of the questionnaire. The main indigo extraction process is almost the same between Hainan Miao and Li dyers, but there are still some differences in teams of indigo-yielding plant species, part used, harvest season, fermentation duration, amount of lime, oxygenation method tools, and annual production frequency (Table 4) . What is most interesting is the Ricinus communis seed use in five Hainan Miao study villages. Ricinus communis L. (Euphorbiaceae), known as gen zong in Hainan Miao language, has two varieties that are distinguished by the color of their stems and leaves (voucher numbers ZLB45, ZLB60). A small number of Ricinus communis seeds were added to the extraction vat at the end of the oxygenation process to help reduce the foam. This is because the Hainan Miao dyers believed that the foam reduced the quality of indigo paste. Commonly 2-5 still moist seeds were crushed on the side of the extraction vat. Some dyers stripped off the seed coat before crushing them. The Ricinus communis seeds were then held while stirring in the extraction vat for 1-2 min before throwing away the seeds at the end of this process. From either variety were used, with no difference in relation to the Ricinus communis variety according to the Hainan Miao dyers.",

In this study, the detailed indigo extraction method of Wrightia laevis was first documented (Table 4 ). Although Wrightia laevis was the least favored (PR = 2.95) for its low indigo paste quality, it was still as a supplement because this species is easy to find around the villages (A 1 = 1.48, A 2 = 1.01). For Hainan Miao dyers, the most cited and favored species is Strobilanthes cusia. The respondents gave the reason that Strobilanthes cusia provide the highest yield of indigo paste according to their experience, which is consistent with Chanayath's result that Strobilanthes cusia gave more indigo than Indigofera tinctoria (the main indigo source in the world) in the ratio of 4:3 [37] . Further, it is easy to survive by cuttings and become the main source of indigo paste in Hainan Miao villages. In China, apart from the indigo paste source, Strobilanthes cusia is also a frequently used Chinese herbal medicine (TMC) that recorded in \"People's Republic of China Pharmacopoeia 2015\" [38] . For example, its roots are known as \"Nan-Ban-Lan-Gen (\u5357\u677f\u84dd\u6839),\" commonly used to prevent and treat virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection [39] . Its leaves and stems are produced as \"indigo naturalis (\u9752\u9edb)\" to treat chronic diseases such as psoriasis [40] . During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Strobilanthes cusia has been listed as one of the eight major anti-SARS medicines [41, 42] . Moreover, prior ethnobotanical surveys have shown that the tender stems and leaves of this species are also as an edible vegetable in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China [43] . So it is not difficult to find that Strobilanthes cusia has potential commercial value for sustainable indigo production and medicinal use. For Li traditional dyers, the most commonly used indigo-yielding species is Indigofera tinctoria, while the most preferred (4.88) one is Indigofera suffruticosa. This is because the growth period of Indigofera suffruticosa is longer than Indigofera tinctoria. So the acreage of Indigofera suffruticosa is smaller in Li villages in spite of its high indigo quality. Indigofera tinctoria, commonly known as \"true indigo,\" is the most widely exploited of all indigo-yielding plant species [44] . This tropical species is thought to \"have spread with dyeing technology (and the word nila itself, as already noted) from India first to South East Asia, then through the Middle East to parts of Africa, and later to America\" [45] . Consequently, Indigofera tinctoria is another potential candidate for sustainable indigo production.",

However, the steeping method practiced by Hainan Miao and Li dyers differs from those used by other minorities. For example, the parts used of Indigofera tinctoria and Indigofera suffruticosa were different. A previous study [1] showed that the indigo compounds from the two species are extracted by steeping leaves, but we found the stems, leaves, and ripe fruit were used in Li villages. This is because Li dyers believed the high-quality indigo paste needed the fruit ripening period according to the experience. So, they usually sow in March to April and harvest from July to September.",

The Ricinus communis seeds were used at the end of the oxygenation process by Hainan Miao dyers but Li dyers did not use them. This is because Hainan Miao believed that Ricinus communis seed use could reduce foam to improve indigo paste quality. This introduced plant species are commonly found in all five Hainan Miao villages, which might be one reason for its use. However, the mechanism of Ricinus communis seed use to improve indigo paste quality is still unknown. Legrand [49] described another plant species used in the steeping method in Santiago Niltepec of Mexico, the pulpy fruit of a local plant known as \"gulavere\" is added to the oxygenation vat to help accelerate sedimentation. Nevertheless, there is no information on which species the local name gulavere represents or on its possible chemical function in assisting indigo sedimentation.",

            "text": "Indican (indoxyl-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside), a second plant metabolite, is the most prominent indigo precursor [50] . Stored in the vacuole of indigo-yielding plant species, indican was hydrolyzed and produce indoxyl after steeping Note: Percentages represent the proportion of the total number of the informants referring to these values in the water, and thereby indoxyl molecules produce a chemical reaction to form indigo pigment [51] . In most common situations, indigo is blue color and indirubin is red [52] . If there were fewer impurities in the indigo paste, the blue and red color would be more obvious. Namely, to a certain extent, the color implies the purity of chemical pigments of indigo paste. This may explain the folk knowledge that Hainan Miao and Li respondents believed those with dark blue and reddish indigo paste were of good quality. Production of indigo paste at the village level has some disadvantages compared to synthetic indigo for two main reasons. Firstly, in addition to water, the actual indigo content in the indigo paste could vary from 2 to 70%, the rest were lime, indirubin, and other organic materials [47] . Yet, synthetic indigo owns consistently high purity, which has always exceeded 90% [1] . To improve the indigo purity of traditional indigo-extracting methods, more attention should be paid to the indican metabolism since the indigo pigments come from the precursor indican as discussed above. Secondly, the method of synthetic indigo production is controllable because it follows specific chemical reactions [6] . However, the indigo yield of the traditional method is so hard to control that even a senior dyer cannot guarantee the same indigo yield every time. The water-to-biomass ratio, fermentation duration, fermentation temperature, lime quality, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration are directly or indirectly related to indigo yield [11] . Therefore, a better understanding of these physicochemical parameters may contribute to adopt novel technologies to help standardize the traditional indigo extraction methods.",
