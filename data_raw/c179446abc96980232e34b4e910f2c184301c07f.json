A subset of genes and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) histone modifications that are associated with PEDV infections were identified. The results revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements involved in the regulation of genes responsive to PEDV infections, which may aid in identifying key regulators and genetic resistant markers for PEDV infections.",

The phenotypic alterations induced by pathogenic infections are usually tightly linked with marked changes in epigenetic modification and gene expression. We performed global mapping of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and transcriptomic analyses in the jejunum of PEDV-infected and healthy piglets using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq techniques. A total of 1885 H3K4me3 peaks that are associated with 1723 genes were characterized. Moreover, 290 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 104 up-regulated and 186 down-regulated genes. Several antiviral genes including 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), ephrin B2 (EFNB2), and CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) with higher H3K4me3 enrichment and expression levels in PEDV-infected samples suggested the potential roles of H3K4me3 deposition in promoting their expressions. Transcription factor annotation analysis highlighted the potential roles of two transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) in modulating the differential expression of genes involved in PEDV infection. The results provided novel insights into PEDV infection from the transcriptomic and epigenetic layers and revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements potentially involved in the host responses.",

Since first recognized in feeding and fattening pigs in England in 1971, PEDV had spread throughout much of Europe, Asia, and America by 2013 [1, 2] . PEDV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the group 1 coronavirus [3] . PEDV replicates in the cytoplasm of villus epithelial cells and causes villi atrophy, shortening, and fusion, which leads to watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration of infected animals. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses unveiled the presence of genetic diversity among PEDV prevalent in different countries, even in different regions of the same country [1, 4] , which increases the difficulties in prevention and control of PEDV infections. In recent years, PEDV is still identified as the main pathogen causing severe diarrhea in pig farms [5, 6] , highlighting the urgency to genetically improve the ability of pigs to resist PEDV infections.",

Transcriptional profiles as the bridge between genomic portrait and protein expression profile play important roles in revealing the immune regulation mechanisms between host cells and viral infections. Recent studies have demonstrated the proteomic profile changes in the jejunum of PEDV-infected piglets and porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) stimulated with PEDV and identified a subset of proteins and signaling pathways potentially responsible for its pathogenesis [7] [8] [9] . However, the transcriptional profile changes in the jejunum of PEDV-infected piglets remain poorly understood. Furthermore, whether PEDV infection induces alterations in the patterns of epigenetic mark H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) that positively associates with gene activity is still scant now.

The occurrences of transcription factor binding site motifs in the promoters of differential expression genes were scanned with the FIMO software [18] , which computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each motif corresponding to each sequence position and converts this score to a p-value. The p-value refers to the probability of a random sequence of the same length as the motif matching that position of the sequence with as good or better a score. False discovery rate analysis was then applied to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequences, and the motif occurrences with a q-value less than 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. The Chi-square test was performed for transcription factor binding site distributions in different gene clusters at the significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05.",

We thus conducted transcription factor annotation analysis of the differential expression genes. After comparative analyses with the AnimalTF 2.0 database [17] , a total of ten transcription factors in 6 families, 15 transcription cofactors, and two chromatin remodeling factors of pigs were identified ( Table 2) . Among these transcription factors, interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3), and Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) have been identified to play important roles in pathogenic infections and host responses [24] [25] [26] . We, therefore, analyzed the occurrences of their TFBSs motifs in the promoter regions of differential expression gene clusters. The prevalence of predicted TFBSs displayed significant differences between the genes from different clusters. In clusters 3, the putative TFBSs of IRF8 demonstrated a higher frequency than in cluster 4 ( Figure 4A ). The genes in clusters 3 and 5 were obviously up-regulated, while those in cluster 4 were obviously down-regulated, suggesting that IRF8 has a role in transcriptional up-regulation of genes relevant to PEDV infections. There were no occurrences of the putative TFBSs in clusters 1, 2, and 6. For transcription factor NFIL3, the putative TFBSs were detected at a frequency lower than 4% in all gene clusters and there were no remarkable differences between these gene clusters ( Figure 4B ). In cluster 2, the putative TFBSs of KLF4 exhibited a frequency of 71.4%, which was significantly higher than that in other gene clusters ( Figure 4C) . Particularly, the log2 fold changes (ranging from 5.3 to 10.9) of genes in cluster 2 were relatively higher, which indicates the potentially significant effects of KLF4 on up-regulating the expression of these genes. The full set of significant motif occurrences is listed in Table S8 . ",

These highlighted an important role of OASL in responses to PEDV infections. OASL has been shown to be a crucial regulator in controlling antiviral innate immunity. It is rapidly induced by viral infections through interferon regulatory factor 3 and by interferon signaling [33] , and exerts antiviral activity by enhancing signaling of the RIG-I RNA sensor [34] . In addition, previous epidemiological studies have revealed the associations of SNPs in the human OASL gene with altered susceptibility to West Nile and hepatitis C virus infections [35, 36] . The OASL gene has also been shown to be obviously up-regulated in response to porcine virus infections such as swine influenza virus and fever virus [37, 38] . In addition, our comparative analysis identified other genes related to host-pathogen interactions such as ISG15 that is an antiviral molecule with activity against both DNA and RNA viruses [39] and AGR2 that regulates the production of intestinal mucus [40] . These findings provided us with an important clue to identify genetic markers and develop therapeutic drug targets to combat porcine viral diseases.",

            "text": "Here we found that IRF8 showed a relatively higher frequency of putative TFBSs in the promoters of genes in the cluster 3, which includes the aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) gene whose expression can be induced by bacterial or viral infections [46, 47] . Particularly, in the promoter of the ISG15 gene, four putative TFBSs of IRF8 were predicted. These genes were differentially up-regulated, which indicated the potentially positive regulatory role of IRF8 in response to PEDV infections by targeting the promoter region of the genes. In addition, increased prevalence of KLF4 binding motifs was predicted in the promoters of genes in cluster 2. KLF4 plays crucial roles in regulating viral infections and host immune responses by binding to the promoters of immune genes such as interferon \u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) [48] , Z transactivator (BZLF1), and R transactivator (BRLF1) [49] . Our data suggested that KLF4 is likely to be involved in modulating PEDV infections by affecting the expression of target genes. Nonetheless, identification of transcription factor motif by motif-based sequence analysis only denotes the potential for the physical binding of transcription factors to the regulatory regions, which do not necessarily mean the biological functions. Mechanistic studies of the roles of the identified transcription factors in gene expression need to be further investigated.",

It is reported that pathogenic viruses can control the global interferon-stimulated gene responses through altered histone modifications [51] . We herein identified the increased H3K4me3 levels at the promoter regions of the OAS1 and OAS2 genes that serve as antiviral effectors by repressing all steps of viral replication [52] . Expression of the OAS2 and OAS2 genes was found to be epigenetically regulated in response to pathogenic infections [53, 54] . Increased expression of these two genes was also detected in the PEDV-infected jejunum samples, which indicated that the expression of the two genes in intestinal epithelial cells may be controlled by H3K4me3 modifications in response to PEDV infections.",

A subset of genes involved in the regulation of PEDV infections was found to be enriched for H3K4me3. Furthermore, our findings of the putative TFBSs prevalence of transcription factors IRF8 and KLF4 in the promoter regions of different gene clusters provided us a useful clue for clarifying the mechanisms modulating the differential expression of gene clusters. These findings may aid in the detection of key regulators and genetic markers resistance to PEDV infections and in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to fight porcine epidemic diarrhea.",
