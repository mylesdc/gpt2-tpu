            "text": "Intrinsically disordered regions in eukaryotic proteomes contain key signaling and regulatory modules and mediate interactions with many proteins. Many viral proteomes encode disordered proteins and modulate host factors through the use of short linear motifs (SLiMs) embedded within disordered regions. However, the degree of viral protein disorder across different viruses is not well understood, so we set out to establish the constraints acting on viruses, in terms of their use of disordered protein regions. We surveyed predicted disorder across 2,278 available viral genomes in 41 families, and correlated the extent of disorder with genome size and other factors. Protein disorder varies strikingly between viral families (from 2.9% to 23.1% of residues), and also within families. However, this substantial variation did not follow the established trend among their hosts, with increasing disorder seen across eubacterial, archaebacterial, protists, and multicellular eukaryotes. For example, among large mammalian viruses, poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing disorder (5.6% and 17.9%, respectively). Viral families with smaller genome sizes have more disorder within each of five main viral types (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA+, dsRNA, retroviruses), except for negative single-stranded RNA viruses, where disorder increased with genome size. However, surveying over all viruses, which compares tiny and enormous viruses over a much bigger range of genome sizes, there is no strong association of genome size with protein disorder. We conclude that there is extensive variation in the disorder content of viral proteomes. While a proportion of this may relate to base composition, to extent of gene overlap, and to genome size within viral types, there remain important additional family and virus-specific effects. Differing disorder strategies are likely to impact on how different viruses modulate host factors, and on how rapidly viruses can evolve novel instances of SLiMs subverting host functions, such as innate and acquired immunity.",

Disordered regions may in some [16] , but not all, cases form a secondary structure on binding to their interaction partner.

Some viruses are encoded within spatially restricted genomes, and being able to map multiple functions to a stretch of protein, facilitated by structural reorganization [22] , may be advantageous. The ability to rapidly acquire small motifs made accessible within disordered stretches of protein that manipulate host proteins by interacting with them may also be beneficial under certain circumstances. Since during evolution viruses often cross between quite different hosts, the evolvability 20 of a virus may be an important feature in certain families. Consequently, disordered regions may enhance the rate of emergence of new phenotypes, in addition to the range of potential phenotypes. The use of compact interfaces allows increased redundancy by allowing functionality to be mediated by a set of short disordered regions (e.g. the Late domains of retroviral Gag proteins) rather than on a single globular interface, resulting in increased evolutionary robustness of viral proteins [10] Thus, a deeper understanding of the role of intrinsically disordered regions in viruses is important if we are to fully understand the relationships between protein sequence and function, and also to understand the relationship between overall proteome organization and long-term evolutionary strategies of different viruses.",

These motifs have roles in manipulating cell signaling, targeting host proteins for proteosomal degradation, directing viral proteins to the correct subcellular localisations, altering transcription of host proteins and deregulating cell cycle checkpoints [10] . For example, the Nef protein of HIV-1 has distinctive motifs mediating interaction with the human proteins NMT1, PCAS-1, Hck, beta-COP, and AP. The Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 protein, has motifs required for binding to TRAF, BTrCP, JAK3 and TRADD proteins, that collectively modulating NF-kB signaling.

SLiMs can be easily and rapidly evolved de novo, whereas evolution of a globular interface for viral host protein interaction may not evolve as quickly. Viruses can acquire functional globular domains from their host, however, horizontally transferred genes are typically acquired only by larger viruses that can incorporate a stolen host gene into their genome without having to jettison other proteins that are vital for independent viral function [24] . Therefore, very small viruses may have the most to gain from the multifunctional flexibility and evolutionary fluidity of disordered regions. On the other hand, their genomes may be so constrained to encode structural proteins with largely ordered domains, that may leave little room for accessory proteins with disordered regions to evolve. Intriguingly, some viruses can avoid such restrictions by encoding two or more overlapping proteins in different reading frames. We anticipated that these competing selection constraints would result in different distributions of disordered regions among different viral groups.",

Table 3 suggests that both effects are present. Firstly, there is a substantial correlation of four-fold degenerate site base composition with predicted protein disorder, in spite of the fact that base composition preferences at these sites do not alter the amino acid sequences. This indicates that base composition is indeed a substantial driver of the extent of predicted protein disorder. The stronger correlations seen for total base composition indicate that it is likely that selection pressures favouring or avoiding protein disorder also have an additional impact on base composition. Accordingly, we corrected for the effects of base composition in further analyses, to determine if disorder variation had a relationship with genome size that was independent of base compositional effects. Since many viruses have pronounced strand asymmetry which is reflected in unequal frequencies at synonymous positions of complementary bases, we corrected for the frequencies of the four bases, by including them as terms in a multiple linear regression. Thus, to account for the effects of base composition, we then fitted two regression models that accounted for both base composition and genome size. In the first, we regressed disorder on base composition. In the second, we regressed disorder on base composition and on genome size. To assess how much variation in disorder was accounted for by genome size (once base composition is allowed for), we estimated the difference in the variance accounted for by the two models (difference of the adjusted R 2 values for each model). This difference provides a measure of the importance of genome size in determining the extent of viral protein disorder. We also inspected whether the genome size term from the second model was statistically significant. The correlation between intrinsic disorder and base composition in all viral genomes ( Figure S1 ) reveals that 'C' is the biggest determinant of intrinsic disorder (r = 0.40). The regression model that accounted for both base composition and genome size in all viruses revealed that 17% of variance in disorder was explained by both base composition and genome size, and that genome size remained a significant predictor of disorder (p = 1.6610 23 ). When we repeated this analysis on family means (that is, we regressed mean disorder of each family on mean genome size, including mean base compositions as a set of four additional covariates), we found that 30% of the variance in disorder is determined by base composition and genome size in families, but that genome size was not a significant predictor of disorder (p = 0.90). Thus, the overall trend noted initially of smaller viral families having more disorder is closely allied with the effects of base composition on genome size.",

While bacterial virus disorder spanned a similar range to that of the bacterial hosts, it was curious to note that fungal viruses show a similar span, but a tendency towards lower disorder, so that the range for fungal viruses is 0.5% to 23%, while their hosts lie in the range of 9% to 32%. The most striking range is seen for vertebrate viruses, from 1.8% to 45.2% disordered, in spite of the relatively limited range of vertebrate host disorder. It is clear that viruses are in many ways independent of their hosts in terms of their propensity for protein disorder.",

            "text": "Clearly, there are a number of determinants of disorder in viruses: genome size, base composition, viral type effects, host effects and family-specific effects. Can we therefore say overall, how important these different factors are? One approach is to integrate all these terms into a single statistical model, and investigate the proportion of variance assigned to each factor. Accordingly, we carried out an analysis of variance which incorporates these various factors. Quantitative predictor variables in the model were base composition (A, T, C and G) and genome size (S) whereas categorical predictors were genome type (Type), host (H) and family (F). In this unified model, the proportion of variance accounted for by the base composition parameters alone was 16.6%; a list of all predictors of disorder and corresponding R 2 values are shown in Table S3 . Family seems to be the single strongest predictor of disorder (74%). Thus, it appears that the most important determinant of how much disorder a virus will have is the family to which it belongs. While a substantial component of this may be down to what broad viral type the family belongs to (36%), clearly there are additional factors. Genome size modeled as a single variable across all viruses adds comparatively little to this model, nor does it add much when other covariates are included (Table S3 ). This is not too surprising, given that the correlations within some families are positive but within other families are negative ( Table 2 ), so that they will cancel out within the overall model. Overall, over 80% of disorder variation can be accounted for by family and base composition. Since we know that genome size is correlated both negatively and positively with disorder within certain families, it is likely that some of the remaining 17% of variance can be accounted for by familyspecific genome size effects, as well as other factors. Thus, between family variability is striking, but there remains substantial within family variability. It appears from these models that individual viral families have distinctive degrees of disorder, most likely reflecting both adaptive and mutational factors. The challenge is to identify these factors, and gain a better understanding of constraints on viral protein function.",

Previous studies [2, 4] had highlighted the fact that many viral proteins are highly disordered, (with most disorder among RNA-binding proteins, moderate disorder among DNA binding proteins, and order among enzymes and multipass membrane proteins [1] ). One broad survey of disorder in viruses with a similar interest to our study [9] gave some consideration to this range of variation in viral disorder. They highlighted that certain proteins have high levels of disorder, pointing out that more than 20 small viruses have over 50% disorder, and that for larger viruses disorder ranges typically between 20 % and 40%. However, they also noted that certain viruses have very low disorder, such as the human coronavirus NL63 (estimated 7.3% disordered residues [9] ). One of the biggest challenges facing our understanding of the dynamics of disorder in viral proteomes is to understand why there are some viruses which strongly avoid disorder.",

Intrinsically disordered regions are more common among eukaryotic genomes than prokaryotic genomes [27, 28] , with putative long (.30 residue) disordered segments found to occur in 2.0% of archaean, 4.2% of eubacterial and around a third of eukaryotic proteins [28, 29, 30] . We might, therefore, have expected that viruses would follow their hosts, a trend discussed in a previous survey of viruses [9] . However, from our analysis, the marked viral variation does not clearly or even substantially follow these main phylogenetic trends of their hosts. Thus, the large double stranded poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing levels of predicted disorder, in spite of the similarity of their hosts. The predicted disorder among viruses of different hosts showed no clear pattern, with prokaryotes having both high disorder (eubacteria, 17.9%) and low disorder (archaea, 6.3%) groups, and with similar variation among the viruses of various eukaryotic hosts (Table 4) . Clearly, a simplistic correlation of disorder with ''complexity'' does not fit well with any measures of either viral or host complexity, and it is likely that the distribution of disorder is influenced by multiple factors. Such factors may well include aspects of latency, virulence, life cycle and selection pressures among mutated viral copies within a cell [31] .",

We hypothesized prior to commencing this study that this would be the case, on the grounds that disordered extended proteins have a larger interaction surface with which they may come in contact with, and modify the function of, host proteins [32] . However, this effect was rather small over all viruses, and was largely removed when correcting for base composition as a potential explanatory factor. When we looked within viral families, we found much more striking correlations between genome size and protein disorder. In a number of families, there was a clear negative correlation between disorder and genome size (even after allowing for base composition), consistent with our original hypothesis, but in a few families there was a positive correlation. How can we account for this? We conclude that there are family-specific determinants of disorder, that relate in some families in part to genome size, in ways that have yet to be identified. Such factors could include mutation rates, pathogenicity and preference for transient versus persistent infection, which may alter the requirement for accessory host interaction proteins. Relationships between genome size and disorder among some bacteria may be consistent with simplification for smaller genomes and less disordered proteins [33] , although it is difficult to determine causation. However, without a much fuller knowledge regarding the adaptive and non-adaptive constraints on a wide range of different viruses, it is difficult to identify the precise components of different viral evolutionary lifestyles that are most likely to have given rise to such strikingly different degrees of protein disorder.",

Inspection of the most disordered proteins (Table S7 ) reveals that they have roles not only in cellular signaling, such as the HIV1 Nef protein, but also in viral structure and movement. The apparent relationship between disorder and base composition suggests that the pattern of mutation, which is the likely main driver of base composition, itself has an influence on the extent of protein disorder. It is unclear to what extent the mutation rate itself may be a partial driver of the extent of disorder [35] : while pox viruses appear to have more rapid mutation rates and lower disorder compared to herpes viruses [36] , these two observations may or may not be linked by direct or indirect causation. A gold standard set of mutation rates for different viruses would help to address this important question, but no such dataset of viral mutation rates exists, and mutation rates cannot be inferred from sequence data as there is no global outgroup alignable to viral proteins shared across many families. Viral ''mimicry'' of protein functions often involves direct hijacking of the gene encoding a host protein [24] . For viruses which move easily amongst different hosts, there may be much greater opportunities for such hijacking of functions. One might anticipate that viruses with more disordered proteins may rely more on mimicry of short motifs, rather than hijacking of large protein domains. Amongst the large Pox and Herpes viruses, it is noticeable that although there may be a similar number of documented instances of gene hijacking amongst both groups [37] , the much more disordered Herpesviruses have noticeably more documented instances of linear motif mimicry [10] . Thus, the extent of disorder is likely to alter the strategies employed by different viruses in subverting host functions.",

More detailed studies will be required to fully ascertain the impact of disorder on function, most likely carried out within particular families, complementing computational predictions of disorder with experimental investigations.",

            "text": "One key goal of understanding disordered sequences and their embedded motifs is the targeting of those motifs in order to modulate protein-protein interactions by small molecules [40, 41] or therapeutic peptides. Short motif interactions have the virtue from the viral perspective of being easily evolved de novo by mutation of a small stretch of disordered protein, to enable interaction with a new host protein. Such critical interaction points within disordered sequences may play a role both in viral structure and in virus-host interaction (Table 4) . Our study provides a clear framework in which to understand the background distribution of disorder in different viruses. This will provide important insights in targeting the most interesting disordered regions. For example, regions of disorder that occur in viruses which tend in general to avoid disorder may be of particular interest, since such disordered regions may play key roles in viral function.",

A total of 78,317 protein sequences were obtained from 2390 viral genomes. The Baltimore classification [42] of viruses that classifies viruses by their genome types and replication strategies was used to divide viruses in seven classes. There were 420 single strand DNA (ssDNA) viruses, 803 We plotted the genome size versus the number of residues (Fig. S14) to help identify the extent to which statistics may be biased by poorly annotated genomes. These outliers are from the Phycodnaviridae (Chlorella viruses), Nimaviridae (Shrimp White Spot Syndrome Virus), Polydnaviridae (Bracoviruses and Ichnoviruses). For a group of Chlorella viruses, the encoded residues exceeds expectation (Fig. S14) . It is noted that many shorter ORFs are likely over-predictions of non-translated putative ORFs [44] and so any investigations of predicted disorder within this family would need to be interpreted with some caution, given that five of the ten members of the Phycodnaviridae showed this excess. Only one other virus showed a marked excess of amino acids predicted, the Shrimp white spot syndrome virus, which is the only representative of the Nimaviridae. For all five members of the Polydnaviridae, there was a deficit of open reading frames relative to expectation. All three of these families were excluded from further analyses, as we made the decision to exclude all families that had ten or fewer members.",

IUPred provides a position-specific score that characterizes the tendency of a given amino acid to fall into an intrinsically ordered or disordered region. For each protein, the IUPred score was generated for each residue in that protein. Each residue was defined as ordered or disordered depending on the IUPred score (S) to be either less than IUPred score threshold (S Th = 0.5) or more respectively. This procedure was repeated for all proteins in a viral genome. Percent intrinsic disorder (D i ) for i th protein is defined as the ratio of the number of residues with IUPred score above S Th and the length of that protein (L i ) given by Equation 1.",
