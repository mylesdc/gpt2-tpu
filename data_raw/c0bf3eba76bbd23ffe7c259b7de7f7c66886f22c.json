Although GhV uses the highly conserved receptor ephrin-B2, the fusogenicity is restricted to cell lines of bat origin. Furthermore, the surface expression of the GhV attachment glycoprotein (G) is reduced compared to NiV and most of this protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we generated truncated as well as chimeric GhV G proteins and investigated the influence of the structural domains (cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, ectodomain) of this protein on the intracellular transport and the fusogenicity following coexpression with the GhV fusion protein (F). We demonstrate that neither the cytoplasmic tail nor the transmembrane domain is responsible for the intracellular retention of GhV G. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tail of GhV G modulates the fusogenicity of GhV F and therefore controls the species-restricted fusogenicity of the GhV surface glycoproteins.",

            "text": "Viral RNA of the Ghana virus (GhV, formerly termed Kumasi virus, GenBank accession no.: HQ660129.1) was detected in a straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) in 2009 [1] . GhV is phylogenetically related to Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) virus, two highly pathogenic members of the genus Henipavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family. HeV and NiV emerged from their reservoir host pteropid bats [2] [3] [4] causing severe and often fatal diseases in humans and domestic animals such as pigs and horses [5] [6] [7] [8] . Due to their zoonotic potential, their high pathogenicity, and the lack of approved therapeutics and a vaccine licensed for use in humans, HeV and NiV are classified as biosafety level 4 pathogens. The zoonotic potential of GhV is unknown and so far, no cases of henipavirus infections of livestock or humans have been reported in Africa; but nevertheless, serological studies provided evidence that fruit bats, domestic animals, and humans in this region harbor neutralizing antibodies reactive against henipaviruses [1, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

The G protein is a type II membrane protein and is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor ephrin-B2 [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The F protein, a type I membrane protein, mediates the fusion between viral and cellular membranes as well as the fusion between infected and neighboring cells to enable the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm and to facilitate the spread of infection, respectively [20] . After synthesis, the F protein is transported to the cell surface as an inactive precursor that has to undergo a recycling step via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to be proteolytically cleaved by the cellular proteases cathepsin L or B within the endosomal compartment [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, the F protein has to undergo conformational changes that are triggered by the interaction between F and G [26] [27] [28] . Upon binding to the cellular receptor, the G protein undergoes three conformational changes in the head and stalk regions that induce the refolding of F into its fusion-active conformation [29, 30] .",

In this way, it has been shown that the GhV G protein interacts with ephrin-B2, the cellular receptor of NiV and HeV, to mediate binding to target cells [31] [32] [33] [34] . However, striking differences between NiV and GhV were observed when the fusogenicity of F was investigated: In the case of NiV, coexpression of F and G resulted in the formation of multinucleated giant cells, so-called syncytia, in different mammalian cell lines. In contrast, the GhV F and G proteins induced significantly smaller syncytia the presence of which was further restricted to bat cell lines [32] [33] [34] [35] . In previous studies, it has been shown that the transport of GhV G to the cell surface is significantly reduced compared to NiV G and that the majority of the GhV G protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that the amount of surface-expressed GhV G is not efficient enough to trigger conformational changes in the F protein that are required to acquire the fusion-active form of F [35, 36] .",

Here, we generated truncated versions of GhV G in which 10 to 58 amino acid (aa) residues of the N-terminus were deleted (GhV G\u220610, \u220621, \u220627, \u220640, \u220646, \u220652, \u220654, \u220658) ( Figure 1) . Furthermore, chimeric G proteins consisting of the transmembrane domain (TM) and ectodomain (ED) of GhV G and the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of NiV G (GhV G CD-NiV), HeV G (GhV G CD-HeV), Moijang henipavirus (MojV) G (GhV G CD-MojV), Cedar henipavirus (CedV) G (GhV G CD-CedV), or Measles virus (MeV) H protein (GhV G CD-MeV) were generated. In addition, NiV G TM and ED were fused to the CD of GhV G (NiV G CD-GhV). Further, we generated chimeric GhV and NiV G proteins in which the TM was replaced by the corresponding section of the other protein (GhV G TM-NiV, NiV G TM-GhV). Proteins consisting of GhV G CD and TM and the ED of NiV G (GhV G ED-NiV) and vice versa (NiV G ED-GhV) have been described previously [35] . To allow detection by immunostaining, all G proteins were fused to a FLAG-epitope at the C-terminal end, while NiV F and GhV F contained an HA-epitope at their corresponding C-terminus. All plasmids were verified by automated sequencing (Eurofins Genomics GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). To determine the intracellular localization, cotransfection experiments with fluorescence-labeled cellular compartment markers for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were performed (EGFP-ER, provided by Frank van Kuppeveld). Differences with respect to syncytium formation were obtained when the truncated G proteins were coexpressed with GhV F in bat (EidNi/41) and non-bat (Vero76 and BHK-21) cells. Consistent with previous publications, coexpression of wildtype GhV F and G mediates syncytium formation only in bat cell lines [32] [33] [34] [35] and the truncated G proteins GhV G\u220610, \u220621, \u220627, \u220640, \u220646, and \u220652 displayed the same phenotype as the full-length GhV G protein. In contrast to that, the deletion of the terminal 54 and 58 aa residues of the CD of GhV G resulted in an enhanced fusogenicity in bat cells as indicated by the increased number as well as the increased size of syncytia (Table 2, Figure  2a ). This effect was most pronounced in the case of GhV G\u220658 (Figure 2b ). Most remarkably and in contrast to the parental G protein, GhV G\u220654 and GhV G\u220658 were able to induce cell-to-cell fusion also in the non-bat cell lines Vero76 and BHK-21 ( Figure 2c ). ",

Despite a similar structural organization, the CD of GhV G is longer compared to the CD of NiV and HeV (61 vs 45 aa residues, respectively, Figure 1b ). In general, the sequence of this domain is not well conserved among the henipavirus species ranging from approximately 40 to 63% aa identity (Table 1) . To determine whether the CD of GhV G-in particular the three potential retention motifs-may contribute to the intracellular retention of this protein and thereby lead to the limited fusogenicity of GhV F and G in comparison to coexpression of NiV F and G, truncated versions of GhV G were generated in which up to 58 aa residues of the CD were deleted in a stepwise fashion (Figure 1c ). Differences with respect to syncytium formation were obtained when the truncated G proteins were coexpressed with GhV F in bat (EidNi/41) and non-bat (Vero76 and BHK-21) cells. Consistent with previous publications, coexpression of wildtype GhV F and G mediates syncytium formation only in bat cell lines [32] [33] [34] [35] and the truncated G proteins GhV G\u220610, \u220621, \u220627, \u220640, \u220646, and \u220652 displayed the same phenotype as the full-length GhV G protein. In contrast to that, the deletion of the terminal 54 and 58 aa residues of the CD of GhV G resulted in an enhanced fusogenicity in bat cells as indicated by the increased number as well as the increased size of syncytia (Table 2, Figure 2a ). This effect was most pronounced in the case of GhV G\u220658 (Figure 2b ). Most remarkably and in contrast to the parental G protein, GhV G\u220654 and GhV G\u220658 were able to induce cell-to-cell fusion also in the non-bat cell lines Vero76 and BHK-21 ( Figure 2c ).

By truncation of the CD of GhV G we obtained modified versions that lacked either the first lysine-rich motif (GhV G\u220627), the first lysine-rich motif and the tyrosine-based motif (GhV G \u220640, \u220646), or all three motifs combined (GhV G\u220652, \u220654, \u220658) (Figure 1c ). To investigate whether these motifs contribute to ER-retention, the surface expression levels and the intracellular expression pattern were analyzed. All truncated G proteins showed a total expression level comparable to that of full-length GhV G as indicated by similar amounts of fluorescence-positive cells (analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis of permeabilized cells) and no increased surface expression was observed for any of the G proteins as exemplarily shown for GhV G\u220654 and \u220658 (Figure 3a) . Furthermore, the truncation of the CD did not affect the intracellular localization and all truncated versions of GhV G showed a clear colocalization with the ER marker, indicating that they are still intracellularly retained (Figure 3b) . When comparing the surface expression level of full-length GhV G to that of GhV G\u220654 and \u220658 by flow cytometry, no significant differences were obtained (Figure 3c ) although the latter proteins increased the fusogenicity of GhV F (Figure 2 ). In addition, to investigate whether the truncation affects the conformation of GhV G, the ability of truncated G proteins to interact with the receptor ephrin-B2 as well as their ability to dimerize has been analyzed.

However, whereas the glycoproteins of NiV and HeV induce cell-to-cell fusion in a broad variety of cells from different host species, syncytium formation upon expression of GhV F and G proteins is restricted to certain bat cells [32] [33] [34] [35] . This difference was believed-at least in part-to be due to an inefficient surface transport of the G protein of GhV, as the restricted surface expression has been shown to be less pronounced in bat cells compared to non-bat cells [35] . Here we analyzed the importance of the functional domains of the G protein of GhV for GhV G surface transport and for triggering the fusogenic activity of GhV F. Intracellular retention is also a characteristic feature of other viral glycoproteins and is often associated with intracellular budding of the respective enveloped viruses, such as coronaviruses, e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or pestiviruses, e.g., bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [41, 42] . Further, viruses from different families express glycoproteins that are retained at intracellular structures, e.g., the envelope proteins E1 and E2 of rubella virus [43, 44] , the E2 and E rns proteins of BVDV [45, 46] , the E1 protein of hepatitis C virus [47] , the Gn and Gc proteins of Bunyamwera virus [48] , or the spike glycoprotein (S) of certain coronaviruses [49] [50] [51] [52] . For the latter, lysine-and/or tyrosine-based motifs have been identified to cause accumulation of the S protein within intracellular compartments of the secretory pathway [50, 53] . The cytoplasmic tail of the GhV G protein contains two lysine-based motifs (25-KKTL-28 and 50-KKQKNQ-55) as well as a tyrosine-based motif (38-YFGL-41), but none of them appears to serve as a retention signal. This is evident from the comparison of the deletion mutants that lacked one, two, or all three motifs; none of them showed an increased surface expression.",

Here an arginine residue within the hydrophobic amino acid sequence of the transmembrane anchor is crucial for the intracellular localization of this surface glycoprotein. However, the TM domain of the GhV G protein lacks a comparable amino acid sequence. When chimeric G proteins were analyzed, GhV G containing the TM of NiV-G did not show enhanced surface expression, while the TM of GhV in the context of NiV G led to an intracellular accumulation of the resulting G protein. Therefore, the information for the intracellular retention of GhV G resides mainly or exclusively within the ED. The presence of putative retention signals within the CD portion of G may raise the question whether these motifs may have a synergistic effect and support the retention signal in the ED. However, the results obtained with the chimeric proteins argue against this possibility, because they did not provide any evidence that CD of GhV-G contains an ER retention signal. Although the ultimate reason for intracellular retention of GhV G could not be uncovered, we could exclude a pivotal role of CD and TM for this retention. Moreover, our data suggest that the ED-more precisely, aa motifs/residues within the ED-might be the cause for GhV G accumulation within the ER. Once attempts to isolate GhV or to generate it by DNA technology have been successful, it will be interesting to find out whether the virus matures at the cell surface or whether the budding process takes place at an intracellular compartment.",

The less efficient fusion activity of the surface proteins of GhV-compared to that of the corresponding proteins of NiV-may be explained by differences in both the F [34] and the G protein [35] . As far as the G protein is concerned, a major difference between GhV and NiV is the aforementioned inefficient surface expression of GhV G. However, surface expression is not the only determinant of the G protein for interacting with the F-protein and inducing membrane fusion. Both the CD and the TM domain may affect the fusion activity, even in the absence of increased transport of the G protein to the cell surface. The importance of CD for the fusion activity is evident from our analysis of the deletion mutants G\u220654 and \u220658. Although the lack of the major part of the cytoplasmic tail did not result in a detectable increase of the surface expression or binding efficiency to ephrin B2, it enhanced the fusion activity in bat cells and more importantly, abolished the species restriction to bat cells. Thus, the CD portion has some restricting effect. It might affect the conformation of G that is required for the interaction with the F protein or it impedes conformational changes within the G protein that are necessary to render the F protein fusion-active [29, 30] . This restriction appears to be a peculiar feature of GhV G because a chimeric protein containing ED and TM of NiV G and CD of GhV G was highly efficient in inducing the fusion activity of NiV F.",

While CD of GhV G did not affect the fusion activity of NiV glycoproteins, replacement of TM by the corresponding domain of GhV completely abolished the fusion activity of NiV F + G. As discussed for CD, the TM domain may affect the conformation of the G protein and thus the interaction with the F protein. An alternative explanation is that there is a direct interaction between the TM domains of the NiV F and G proteins and that this interaction does not tolerate the replacement of the NiV G-TM domain by GhV-G-TM.",

Moreover, we identified the CD of GhV G as a modulator of GhV F fusogenicity and, most importantly, as the factor controlling species restriction of F-mediated membrane fusion. Future efforts will be undertaken to unravel which aa motif/residues are responsible for intracellular GhV G retention and whether the CD of GhV G (and other henipaviruses G proteins) is a key factor controlling the zoonotic potential.
