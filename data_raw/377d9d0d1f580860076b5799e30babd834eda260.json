However, influenza cases are reported almost yearround in tropical regions. Taiwan is located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, split north-south near the middle of the island by the Tropic of Cancer. Influenza cases are reported throughout the year with some summer influenza epidemics, but with peak number of reported cases occurring annually in autumn and winter from late October to March [2] . Moreover, studies have shown that excess influenza deaths during these months similar to those in the temperate zones can also observed in Taiwan [3] [4] . It has also been proposed previously that Taiwan is an evolutionarily leading region for global circulation of influenza virus A (H3N2) [5] . Moreover, past studies on sequence comparison of seasonal influenza strains A(H1N1) in Taiwan versus vaccine strains have showed that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains in 1995-2003 were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced [6] . Hence investigating circulation patterns of seasonal influenza virus strains might shed lights on possible global circulation patterns in the following years.",

Influenza viruses (of the family Orthomyxoviridae) are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes [7] . Of its two genera, one includes influenza A and B viruses, and the other influenza C virus. Type A influenza viruses are subtyped based on 16 known hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes that exist in wild birds and provide a source of viral HA and NA subtypes antigenically novel to humans. The subtypes are further classified according to the combinations of virus surface proteins, abbreviated as H1-H16 and N1-N9 [8] [9] , starting with the 1918 swine H1N1 influenza which led to the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic. Its descendants include an H2N2 pandemic strain in 1957, which circulated until 1968 when it was replaced by H3N2 pandemic viruses. Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses (IAV), influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are currently circulating yearly among humans. Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than that of A and B. Therefore, only influenza A and B viruses are included in seasonal influenza vaccines recommended every year by the WHO.",

However, the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic took many by surprise, and demonstrated that the mechanism for circulation pattern of influenza strains is still poorly understood and it is practically impossible to predict the occurrence and the virus subtype of future pandemics.",

Examining past influenza pandemics throughout history, it has been observed that strains of pandemic influenza also led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. For example, while the 1889-1893 pandemic made three or more successive annual and largely seasonal reappearances, the 1918 pandemic spread in two or three rapidly recurring waves within a short period of time in many parts of the world (e.g., [11] ) before settling into a pattern of annual seasonal recurrences [12] . Yet both of these pandemics resulted in high human mortality, especially that of 1918. On the other hand, the virus strains causing the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) influenza pandemics, unlike their 1918 H1N1 virus predecessor, did not immediately produce rapidly successive waves of infections or multiple annual recurrences of high mortality, but settled more quickly into familiar patterns of annual seasonal endemic circulation [13] [14] .",

A(H1N1)pdm09 first appeared in Taiwan in two pairs of swiftly succeeding waves in less than two years, first in summer and autumn/winter of 2009, then again in summer and autumn/winter of 2010 (Fig 1a) . It then occurred only sparingly for more than one year until another two waves, respectively at the beginning of 2013 and 2014, or the latter half of influenza seasons in Taiwan (Figs 1b and 2) . The pattern is similar to what occurred in the aftermath of 1918-1919 pandemic [12] . Moreover, since 2009 a wave of A(H1N1)pmd09 occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011-2012 season, when influenza B circulated. We note that, although it did not return in the 2014-2015 influenza season, AH1N1 circulated again in Taiwan in the 2015-2016 season [32] . 4 . At most of the times during the time period under investigation, one of the three strains always tend to be the dominant circulating strain, even when co-circulation with some other strains occurred (Fig 4) . One exception is the first half of 2013 (Fig 4b) , where one would be difficult to conclude which, among A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2, is the dominant strain in that particular time period. Moreover, we are able to fit a wave of infections for both of these two strains during some parts of that half year (see Table 2 and Fig 1(a) and 1  (b) ). Although we note that a much larger study period than our data allows would likely offer more insights. 5 . It has been proposed that, due to school/business closure due to traditional lunar New Year holidays in Taiwan that falls typically between week 4 to week 8 of each year, more frequent contacts in the households among family members who spent more time at home during the holidays tends to result in increased transmission [28] . It is interesting to note that during 2008-2014, at least one wave of cases was detected in the first two months of every year, including two circulating waves of B and A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2014 (Fig 2) .",

Another event that might have affected the transmissibility we observed was the mass immunization program initiated in Taiwan in late 2009 where more than five million of the 23 million Taiwanese were immunized with AdimFlu-S (unadjuvanted H1N1v from Adimmune) or Focetria 1 (MF59 1 adjuvanted H1N1v from Novartis) within five months [36] [37] . Perhaps also indicative of the impact of herd immunity, the transmissibility of 2009 autumn/winter wave of pH1N1 was lower than that of the previous summer wave. Similarly in 2010, when R for the autumn/winter wave (when mass immunization program was again in place) was again lower than that of earlier summer wave. It is also interesting to note that the summer waves in 2009 and 2010 had almost identical transmissibility (R = 1.17 with very similar 95% CI ranges, Table 2 The estimates for R are consistently within range of other estimates for seasonal influenza in tropical-subtropical (e.g., Taiwan [29] and Australia [33] ) and temperate regions (e.g., the United States and France [33] ). However, the estimate of R during 2009 pandemic period is lower than that of many studies from other countries (see, e.g., [38] ), but it is more similar to estimates obtained for Southern Hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) [25, 35] , as well as for Taiwan [34] and for Hong Kong [39] . All of these countries and territory have most of its territory in the tropical-subtropical region, which might be an indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza.",

This co-circulation of variants distinguished by specific AA substitutions was witnessed among H3N2 strains observed in Ontario, which are found to be related to the Victoria clade by using phylogenetic analysis. Due to the emergence of the Victoria 208 clade of A/Perth/16/2009 strain, WHO recommended a change to the H3N2 strain component of the 2012-2013 influenza vaccine, to A/Victoria/361/ 2011-like virus [41] . This highlights the hypothesis that antigenic drift among one subtype could still lead to epidemic event in human history. In this study, we present quantitative evidence of different values of R for different epidemic waves of the same influenza subtype (Fig  3) . Recent studies have shown that antigenic drift might help to explain seasonal influenza circulation patterns in particular subtypes [42] .",

The data used came from TCDC influenza surveillance system data, where the samples were collected from patients with ILI from 255 contracted healthcare facilities and laboratories in Taiwan, which is not a random sampling of influenza cases in Taiwan. Unfortunately, the proportion of ILI cases tested is not known, and the proportion of positive tests varies from year to year (see Table 1 ). Moreover, the subtype-specific proportion of positive tests is not available from Taiwan CDC database. Hence we are unable to suitably adjust for the differences in the sampling rate, which results in unavoidable bias. This common but severe limitation in virology data size leads to uncertainty in our result. Since the proportion of asymptomatic cases might also be affected by specific subtype, this issue can only be satisfactorily resolved with comprehensive serotesting on the population level, which is not feasible given the limitation in laboratory testing today.",
