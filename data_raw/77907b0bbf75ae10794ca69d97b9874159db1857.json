This research views such spreads as geo-social interaction problems, because population mobility connects different groups of people over geographical locations via which the viruses transmit. Previous research argued that geo-social interaction patterns identified from population movement data can provide great potential in designing effective pandemic mitigation. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of designing control strategies taking into account geo-social interaction patterns.",

The simulation results show that locally targeted vaccination has the potential to keep infection to a small number and prevent spread to other regions. At some small probability, the local control strategies will fail; in these cases other control strategies will be needed. This research further explores the impact of varying spatial-social scales on the success of local vaccination strategies. The results show that a proper spatial-social scale can help achieve the best control efficacy with a limited number of vaccines.",

However, little work has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategy design using such geo-social interaction patterns [11] .

Each agent in the population is assigned to an infection status (e.g., susceptible, infectious, or recovered). Infection dissemination over those contact networks depends on the likelihood of infection and individual-level human interactions [18] . At this point, network topology plays a significant role in the speed and extent of epidemic dynamics within a population [19] .

Some research has suggested that individuals who are socially close to an infection should have a high priority to be vaccinated, such as family members or office mates of those individuals [26, 27] . Other research has reported that targeting individuals with a large number of social contacts for immunization is an effective control strategy [24, 28] , when community structure is not strong.

The typical intervention strategy relevant to spatial distance is to simply apply a certain distance threshold (e.g., 5 km) to prohibit long-range trips' transmission [32] . However, human interaction patterns are much more complicated than a simple distance threshold, given that population mobility connects different groups of people over geographical locations with varying distances. Previous research shows that disease transmission (i.e., influenza) starts with a local growth followed by a long distance transmission to the whole population [33] . It indicates that there are three important characteristics in terms of disease transmissions: the locations of infection sources, human interactions within locations, and the movement of individuals among different locations. The first two characteristics determine the early stage of disease transmission patterns. The last characteristic describes the time course and geographic spread of the disease outbreak at the subsequent stage. The three characteristics determine human geo-social interaction patterns, based upon which researchers can design effective control strategies before airborne diseases occur. Thus, this research proposes that a new framework in terms of an effective disease control should identify geo-social interaction patterns first and then transform human interaction patterns into knowledge to design and evaluate the efficacy of control scenarios.",

The Epi-Fast tool allows for a disease transmission and public health intervention simulation based on the explicit representation of social contact networks among individuals [35, 36] .

Guo [10] develops a visual analytics tool to allow the identification of human interaction patterns, but it does not support designing and evaluating the efficacy of control scenarios considering the patterns.",

Each node represents individuals and edges are face-to-face interactions without directions. Each node has the attribute of classname that indicates the corresponding grade level and class number, and the teachers are assigned as the class of \"Teachers\" (Table 1) . Edges between two nodes use the attribute \"duration\" to describe the cumulative time between two nodes in faceto-face proximity within 1 day ( Table 2 ). The cumulative time is measured over an interval of 20 s that allows RFID to assess the proximity of two individuals with a probability over 99 % [38] . This study uses the data measured on the 2 days. This study converts the weighted edge table into the weighted networks among each individual. Each node has the attribute of classname to distinguish nodes from different communities. The data has been stored as comma-separated values (CSV) file format for input.",

First, the resolution of contact network data from other collections relevant for infectious disease transmission is too coarse for airborne disease transmission; these include surveys, socio-technological networks, mobile devices, and large scale human interaction simulation models [7] . Second, our research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategy using human interaction patterns and the high-resolution data used in this research can capture the CPIs relevant to disease transmission. Third, schools are considered to play an important role in infectious disease spread such as influenza mainly because of the high density of CPIs [39] and the high-resolution data provides an opportunity to design micro-interventions considering human interaction patterns and compare the outcomes of alternative mitigation measures. Lastly, before the availability of high-resolution contact network data from school environments, school closure has been proposed as an effective mitigation strategy [40] . Such measures however cause high associated social and economic costs. With the high-resolution contact network data, Gemmetto et al. [39] have suggested that targeted grade closure strategies can achieve results that are almost as effective as the school closure, at a much lower cost. The targeted grade closure strategies focus more on social aspects of network structures (i.e., the targeted class and its corresponding grade), but they do not take full advantage of the high-resolution data that can describe the real human spatial-social interaction patterns.",

Network visualization has a rich history [41, 42] that has generated many variants on two primary categories of network visualization methods: node-link visualization and matrix-based visualization [43] . This study applies the matrix view to represent our network data ( Fig. 1) for two reasons: a matrix view has the advantage to exhibit high-level structures (relationships between different communities) by finding the proper ordering of rows and columns [44] ; the proper ordering of rows and columns in this application is determined by the communities in which infected cases are located. For example, the matrix view on the right in the Fig. 1a displays the interaction data with rows and columns organized by grade and class from 1st grade class A at the top left to 5th grade class B in the lower right. The first infected individual in the scenario is in grade/class 5A. In this way, users can identify the clusters of communities with the strongest spatial-social interactions and then focus vaccination or other preventative measures within those communities rather than applying the response uniformly to all communities. This targeted response is potentially more efficient (in overall use of resources) and more effective (in minimizing the proportion of individuals who are infected).",

Specifically, each individual in our data set is considered as an agent who is described as one of four disease states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered (SEIR) [45] ; this is socalled SEIR agent-based modelling. A single influenza infection is randomly introduced into the network with all other initially susceptible individuals. Influenza is chosen as an exemplar because it is a common infectious disease with reasonably well known transmission characteristics. This study assumes that transmission can only occur during the day time, and only on weekdays (thus when the individuals involved are at the school). Though this simplifying assumption is not realistic, it allows an analyst to analyze the disease spread and design control scenarios starting from one single infected case without considering multiple introductions of infected cases. After coming in contact with an infection, a susceptible individual has a transmission probability 0.0015 per 20 s of contact (basic duration measurement unit) to be infected. This value has been chosen because it generates values of R 0 (the basic reproductive number) consistent with observed R 0 of pandemic influenza (0.9-2.1) in previous studies [46, 47] . R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated in a susceptible population [48] . The calculation of R 0 in this case study follows the steps: randomly generate one new infected case 100 times, simulate disease transmissions 100 times for each new infected case within the network according to parameters from the Table 3 , and then calculate average R 0 for each simulation. Both of the derived R 0 based Table 1 on the matrix view and XY plot. Yellow indicates that individuals are in an exposed state, red indicates an infectious state, and the blue indicates a recovery state on the two networks respectively are approximately equal to 1.8-1.9 which falls into the observed R 0 pandemic influenza (0.9-2.1). Upon infection, the individual enters into the exposed period (infected but not infectious). The mean exposed days, 3 days, will be used in this simulation [49] . After the exposed period, an exposed individual will become symptomatic and infectious. The infectious period used in this project is 7 days, the mean days for patients who recovered [49] . This study assumes that individuals cannot be infected again after recovery. Figure 1d shows a simulated influenza infection according to the parameters in the Table 3 . The tool can be applied to study other emerging infectious diseases (e.g., measles) directly with the input of their corresponding parameters.",

The random-based vaccination strategy randomly identifies a fraction of the population to vaccinate. The basic idea of degree-based, betweenness-based, and strength-based strategies is first to rank the importance of individuals and then vaccinate the individuals from highest importance to lowest. The degree-based vaccination strategy ranks individuals according to the number of contacts during the day of measurement for vaccination. The betweenness-based vaccination strategy prioritizes individuals according to their betweenness centrality [50] , capturing the extent to which a particular node lies on the bridge among different communities. The strength-based vaccination strategy ranks individuals according to their total time exposed to others during the day of measurement for vaccination. Given that the vaccination results are sensitive to vaccination rates, the tool provides a variety of options in terms of the percentage of the population vaccinated: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 %. To compare the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on the whole population and local human geo-social interactions, this tool provides two panels on the left of the tool: Whole Population Control Design and Selected Population Control Design. The former panel allows users to select control strategies and control rates based on the whole population, whereas the latter panel allows users to select control strategies and control rates based on the geo-social interaction patterns (orange area in the Fig. 2) .",

Figure 4a , b shows that all of the eight vaccination strategies can produce a decreasing number of infections in proportion to the increasing vaccination fractions. The random-based vaccination strategy produces the highest number of infections, followed by the random-based vaccination strategy with the local selected control areas in Fig. 2a, b . The other three pairs: degree-based, betweenness-based, and strength-based vaccination strategies exhibit the same pattern: the three strategies with the local selected control areas outperform those strategies with the whole area, respectively. The explanation for the pattern is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Figure 5 displays the percentage of the local control success for the four local vaccination strategies within 10,000 simulation runs. As the vaccination fractions increase, all of the four local vaccination strategies can produce a higher percentage of the local control success, but to different degrees. In addition, when the local control scenarios are successful, they can produce a significantly lower number of infected cases (Fig. 6) . Those results show that when the vaccination fraction reaches a relatively high level (i.e., 30 %) with the selected control areas, the disease transmission can be confined locally at a very high percentage (i.e., 90-95 %), resulting in only a small number of infections (i.e., [2] [3] [4] [5] . Figures 5 and  6 shows that the former can stop the disease transmission locally at a certain probability (Fig. 5) , which also results in the lower number of infections (Fig. 6) . Figure 4 shows that the disease transmission cannot be confined locally at 100 %, which also results in the high number of infections (Fig. 7) . For example, when the local vaccination fraction in terms of degree-based, betweennessbased and strength-based control strategies reaches to 30 %, a high number of individuals (i.e., in Fig. 7 are infected at a very low percentage (5-10 %) in Fig. 5 . Those results suggest that containing disease outbreaks locally should be highly recommended, but the followup control strategies (e.g., vaccination) are needed if the local control strategies are not successful.",

This section only displays the simulation results with the second day, Friday, October 2nd 2009, because the 2 days' results will generate the same conclusion as below. Figures 8 and 9 compare spatial-social extent of affected areas between the whole area and the selected area control scenarios with 30 % vaccination rate. The average number of infections based on the simulation results is displayed on each cell in each matrix. Within the selected areas in each matrix (in purple square), local control scenarios can produce a much lower number of infections (Fig. 9 ) compared to the whole area control scenarios (Fig. 8) . This is because placing the same amount of vaccines within a smaller spatial-social extent of areas would cause a lower number of infections locally. However, outside the selected areas, there are a much larger number of infections ( Fig. 9 ) compared to the whole area control scenarios (Fig. 8) . Each pie chart in Fig. 9 shows the number of local control successes versus the number of local control failures with 10,000 simulation runs. Each bar chart in Fig. 9 represents the average number of infections between the local control success and local control failure. It shows that there is a high probability (see pie chart) to contain the disease outbreak locally with 30 % vaccination rate, but a larger disease outbreak would occur (see bar chart) if the local control fails at a low probability. Those results suggest that if the local control scenarios fail, new control strategies have to be implemented to avoid disease outbreaks outside the selected control areas. Therefore, the efficacy of vaccination strategies in terms of spatialsocial extent of infection also suggests that local vaccination control would be a good control strategy. On the other hand, this strategy should be complemented with other control strategies if the local ones are not successful at a low likelihood.",

It implies that a proper spatial-social scale can help achieve the best control efficacy with a limited number of vaccinations.

With real world human interaction data as a case study, this research compares the efficacy of vaccination strategies between the spatial-social interaction patterns and the whole areas. The simulation results show that the control strategies based on spatial-social interaction patterns can lead to a significant reduction of epidemic size in terms of total number and spatial-social extent at a very high likelihood within the school environment.

This study provides valuable insights for designing effective control strategies that consider the geo-social interaction patterns and by doing so help meet the above challenges. Our approach demonstrates that the geo-social interaction patterns can help identify critical individuals, locations, and clusters of locations for disease control purposes. Geo-social interaction patterns should be used to implement control policies because simple distance threshold (e.g., 5 km) [32] cannot capture the most likely and complicated disease transmission processes. The varying spatial-social scales can help geographically and socially prioritize limited resources (e.g., vaccines) in time critical situations during an outbreak. After the first infections are reported, the varying spatial-social scales can help identify a proper scale for immediate actions. The distribution of available vaccines within the proper scale can also give an idea how likely it is that the infection can be confined within the scale. Based on the likelihood, policy makers can have a priority list according to limited resources and time to prepare for the situation when the infection cannot be confined within the scale.",

            "text": "Though the real, high-resolution human interaction data analysed here provides a proof of concept to study the impact of geo-social mixing patterns and scales on infectious disease control, three major limitations of this research are important to mention. First, the data used in this research measure the frequency of spatial proximity between individuals, but they do not include spatial topology information (e.g., relative position of the classrooms). Such spatial information has mostly been used to build human interaction network such as assigning individuals to home or workplace according to their relative positions [36, 52] . After the human interaction network is built, infectious disease simulation is based on the network topology rather than spatial topology. Thus, the agent-based simulation processes based on our data are similar as other models with spatial topology information. Second, though vaccination strategies we discussed in this research are novel, we only tested them with one specific dataset corresponding to one particular school. High resolution data collected from different schools or different countries [7] can capture varying human interaction patterns within the classes and among different classes. Lastly, though the high resolution data can capture the real human interaction patterns for epidemic analysis research purpose, its limitation comes from relatively small network size.",

            "text": "The above limitations illustrate several future research directions in terms of GS-EpiViz development with more complex human interaction data. First, insights could be achieved by comparing effectiveness of the proposed strategies using such high-resolution data describing the real spatial-social interaction patterns from other schools or countries. Second, It would represent an important step to apply the proposed strategies to human interaction data at a larger scale (e.g., urban). In reality, each classroom in this study can be viewed as one geographical location (e.g., workplace, home) at larger spatial scales (e.g., cities), whereas human movement among different classrooms can be viewed as spatial interactions among geographical locations. Gao and Bian [53] found that human interaction network within a metropolitan community is spatially clustered. Thus, the effectiveness of our vaccination strategies based on the school data with the high density of CPIs implies that those strategies are very likely to be effective to control disease spread with larger scale spatial-social network data with a large number of individuals move within and between communities on a daily basis such as urban areas [22] . We expect that the strategies would be more effective to control infectious disease transmissions with larger scale spatial-social network with weak connections between sparse population distributions such as rural areas [22] . In terms of network size, the space complexity in GS-EpiViz is O(m + n + k 2 ), in which m represents the total number of edges, n represents the number of nodes, and k represents the number of communities. Then it would not be a problem for GS-EpiViz to deal with large data sets (up to 1 GB). For example, a network with 1,000,000 nodes and 5,000,000 edges and 1000 communities requires approximately 1 gigabytes of internal memory for handling the data all at once.",

Either relationship can play an important role in exploring proper vaccination strategies. Social or spatial relationships, respectively, have received substantial attention, while the mixed interactions of the social and spatial relationships have often been under-studied [22] . To our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to evaluate the efficacy of control scenarios when considering geo-social interaction patterns and to bring the concept of scale into the design of control scenarios. GS-EpiViz facilitates the vaccination strategy evaluation with local spatial-social interaction patterns and varying spatial-social scales. The results provide insights into community-based planning within school environment and potentially at larger spatial scale (e.g., urban, rural) for controlling emerging air-borne infectious diseases.",
