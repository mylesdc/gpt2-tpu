Here we reported the design, synthesis and characterization of two peptide-based membrane fusion inhibitors targeting HCoV-229E spike protein heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains, 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, respectively. We found that 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P could interact to form a stable six-helix bundle and inhibit HCoV-229E spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC 50 of 5.7 and 0.3 \u00b5M, respectively. 229E-HR2P effectively inhibited pseudotyped and live HCoV-229E infection with IC 50 of 0.5 and 1.7 \u00b5M, respectively. In a mouse model, 229E-HR2P administered intranasally could widely distribute in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and maintain its fusion-inhibitory activity. Therefore, 229E-HR2P is a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral agent for the treatment and prevention of HCoV-229E infection.",

Currently, HCoV-229E continues to evolve by mutation and recombination, leading to changes in its spike immunogenicity, infection mechanism, and even clinical symptoms [14] [15] [16] . For example, serological studies reported that infection of Sendai-H HCoV-229E, a new isolate, was possibly related to Kawasaki disease [16] .

            "text": "Similar to other CoVs, HCoV-229E belongs to type I enveloped virus. Its spike (S), consisting of S1 and S2 subunits on viral membrane, plays vital roles in viral entry into the host cells [2] . The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for binding the cellular receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN) [17] . The S2 subunit, which is comprised of fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain fusion (CP), is responsible for mediating viral fusion and entry [18] . In the native state, HCoV-229E S protein is an inactive precursor [2] . During the viral infection process, target cell proteases can activate S protein by cleaving it into S1 and S2 subunits. For example, when HCoV-229E enters the host cell through the plasma membrane fusion pathway, HCoV-229E S protein can be cleaved and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) [2] . Interestingly, TMPRSS2 is expressed widely in the human respiratory tract where epithelial cells are also targeted for viral infection [2] . Therefore, TMPRSS2 plays an important role in promoting HCoV-229E infection in the human airway [2, 14] . However, if HCoV-229E infects target cells through the endosomal membrane fusion pathway, then its S protein can be cleaved and activated by cathepsin L (CPL), a pH-dependent cysteine protease in endosome [19] . Previously, we and others discovered that C-peptides derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 HR2 region possess highly potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activities [20] [21] [22] . Among them, T20, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first HIV fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug [23] . Subsequently, we identified several HR2-peptides targeting the HR1 domains of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with potent viral fusion inhibitory activity [24] [25] [26] . Their mechanisms of action have been well documented. As shown in Figure 1 , after RBD binding of coronavirus S1 to the corresponding receptors, S2 changes conformation, including the insertion of FP into the target cell membrane, exposure of the pre-hairpin coiled coil of HR1 domain, and the interaction between viral HR2 domain and HR1 trimer to form six-helix bundle (6-HB), thus bringing the viral envelope and cell membrane into close proximity for viral fusion and entry. At the prefusion intermediate state, the peptides derived from the HR2 and HR1 domains of the CoV S proteins, designated HR2P and HR1P, interact with the viral exposed HR1-trimer and HR2 domain, respectively, and competitively inhibit viral autologous 6-HB formation, thus blocking virus-cell membrane fusion [27, 28] .",

As shown in Figure 2c , 229E-HR1P or 229E-HR2P alone displayed a relatively low \u03b1-helicity structure, whereas the mixture of 229E-HR1P/229E-HR2P at equimolar concentration showed a complex with high \u03b1-helicity, as characterized by the saddle-shaped negative peak at 208 and 222 nm in the far UV region of the CD spectrum. Meanwhile, this helical bundle showed strong thermal stability with a Tm of 90.1 \u2022 C (Figure 2d) , which is higher than that of the MERS-CoV HR1P/HR2P complex (~87 \u2022 C). The above results confirm that peptides derived from HCoV-229E HR1 and HR2 domains are capable of harboring the biological activity required to mimic viral fusion core structure by forming 6-HB in vitro. Meanwhile, the 229E-HR1P/229E-HR2P complex provides a useful model for studying the detailed role of the HCoV-229E 6-HB fusion core in mediating viral fusion and entry. results confirm that peptides derived from HCoV-229E HR1 and HR2 domains are capable of harboring the biological activity required to mimic viral fusion core structure by forming 6-HB in vitro.

Accordingly, to assess the inhibitory activities of 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, we established a cell-cell fusion model. To accomplish this, we used Huh-7 cells, naturally expressing the APN receptor of HCoV-229E on the cell surface [17, 30] , and 293T cells that simultaneously coexpress HCoV-229E S protein on the cell surface and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) in the cytoplasm (293T/229E/EGFP) as the target and effector cells, respectively ( Figure 3a ). After coculture of effector cells (293T/229E/EGFP) and target cells (Huh-7) at 37 \u00b0C for 3 to 6 h, we could observe cells that had apparently fused, using fluorescence microscopy, which showed larger size and weaker fluorescence than unfused cells. This can be explained by the diffusion of fluorescence into one or more cells that fuse together ( Figure 3b ).

            "text": "Based on our previous experience in discovery of fusion inhibitory peptides against HIV [20] , SARS-CoV [24] and MERS-CoV [25] , we designed and synthesized peptides, 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, derived from the HR1 and HR2 domains of the HCoV-229E S protein S2 subunit, respectively. Based on biophysical analyses, we have shown that these peptides interact to form 6-HB with strong thermal stability, suggesting that 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P may interact with the viral HR2 and HR1 domains, respectively, to form heterologous 6-HB, thus blocking viral fusion core formation and inhibiting fusion between the viral and target cell membranes. Indeed, 229E-HR2P showed high potency in inhibiting HCoV-229E S-mediated cell-cell fusion in both pseudotyped and live HCoV-229E infection, which is consistent with the results of HR2 peptides against HIV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [20, 24, 25] . However, in contrast to the HR1 peptides derived from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins that show no membrane fusion inhibitory activities [24, 25] , 229E-HR1P also exhibited inhibitory against HCoV-229E infection, albeit with less potency than 229E-HR2P. This is possibly because HR1 peptide from HCoV-229E S protein has higher \u03b1-helicity than that from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [24, 25] . Therefore, it may be easier for HCoV-229E HR1P to form \u03b1-helical trimer to interact with the viral HR2 domain. Similarly, the N28 peptide derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 domain could not form \u03b1-helical trimer in solution and thus lacked HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity. However, the N28Fd, in which the trimerization motif Foldon (Fd) was conjugated to Cterminus of N28, could form \u03b1-helical trimer in solution and exhibit potent anti-HIV-1 activity [33] . Therefore, the antiviral activity of 229E-HR1P may be improved by adding Fd to the C-terminus of 229E-HR1P peptide.",

            "text": "Based on our previous experience in discovery of fusion inhibitory peptides against HIV [20] , SARS-CoV [24] and MERS-CoV [25] , we designed and synthesized peptides, 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, derived from the HR1 and HR2 domains of the HCoV-229E S protein S2 subunit, respectively. Based on biophysical analyses, we have shown that these peptides interact to form 6-HB with strong thermal stability, suggesting that 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P may interact with the viral HR2 and HR1 domains, respectively, to form heterologous 6-HB, thus blocking viral fusion core formation and inhibiting fusion between the viral and target cell membranes. Indeed, 229E-HR2P showed high potency in inhibiting HCoV-229E S-mediated cell-cell fusion in both pseudotyped and live HCoV-229E infection, which is consistent with the results of HR2 peptides against HIV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [20, 24, 25] . However, in contrast to the HR1 peptides derived from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins that show no membrane fusion inhibitory activities [24, 25] , 229E-HR1P also exhibited inhibitory against HCoV-229E infection, albeit with less potency than 229E-HR2P. This is possibly because HR1 peptide from HCoV-229E S protein has higher \u03b1-helicity than that from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [24, 25] . Therefore, it may be easier for HCoV-229E HR1P to form \u03b1-helical trimer to interact with the viral HR2 domain. Similarly, the N28 peptide derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 domain could not form \u03b1-helical trimer in solution and thus lacked HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity. However, the N28Fd, in which the trimerization motif Foldon (Fd) was conjugated to C-terminus of N28, could form \u03b1-helical trimer in solution and exhibit potent anti-HIV-1 activity [33] . Therefore, the antiviral activity of 229E-HR1P may be improved by adding Fd to the C-terminus of 229E-HR1P peptide.",

In the endosomal pathway, CPL plays an important role in cleaving and activating 229E S protein, and the inhibitors of CPL could inhibit HCoV-229E infection [19] . Bertram et al. have reported that TMPRSS2 on the target cells in the respiratory epithelium could cleave and activate 229E S to promote viral infection [2] . In human airway epithelial cells, TMPRSS2 is expressed on the cell surface and is associated with several coronavirus receptors, such as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), and APN, suggesting that TMPRSS2 can assist many coronaviruses to infect human airway epithelial cells through the plasma membrane fusion route [2, [34] [35] [36] . Most recently, Matsuyama et al. have reported that the current clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferably use TMPRSS2, rather than CPL, to infect epithelial cells in the human respiratory tract [14] , suggesting that HCoV-229E-specific fusion inhibitory peptides are expected to inhibit membrane fusion mediated by HCoV-229E S protein that is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2.",

For example, Cinanserin targets viral 3C like (3CL) proteinase [40] ; K22 inhibits the synthesis of membrane-bound viral RNA [41] ; N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) polymers inhibit the interaction between virus and receptor [42] ; Pyrrolidine-2 (Py-2) is a phospholipase A2\u03b1 (PLA 2 \u03b1) inhibitor [43] ; silvestrol is a eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4A) inhibitor [44] ; and chloroquine inhibits the activation of cellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [45] . In contrast to these inhibitors, 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P inhibit fusion and entry of HCoV-229E into the target cells by targeting HR2 or HR1, respectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the combination of 229E-HR2P or 229E-HR1P and the above inhibitors with different antiviral mechanisms may have a synergistic effect against HCoV-229E infection. We have previously demonstrated that intranasal application of HR2PM2 and interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) in combination exhibited significant synergistic anti-HCoV-229E activity [26] .",
