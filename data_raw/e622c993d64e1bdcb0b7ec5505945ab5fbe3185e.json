Here, we study spatial organization of DNA synthesis during multiround transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) using pulse-labeling with ethynyl nucleotides and cycloaddition of azide fluorophores. We report a hitherto unknown and unexpected outcome of virus-host interaction. Consistent with the current understanding of the single-step growth cycle, HSV suppresses host DNA synthesis and promotes viral DNA synthesis in spatially segregated compartments within the cell. In striking contrast, during progressive rounds of infection initiated at a single cell, we observe that infection induces a clear and pronounced stimulation of cellular DNA replication in remote uninfected cells. This induced DNA synthesis was observed in hundreds of uninfected cells at the extended border, outside the perimeter of the progressing infection. Moreover, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that this activation is maintained, resulting in a propagating wave of host DNA synthesis continually in ad-",

The host cell cycle is also modulated by virus infection and can be stimulated or suppressed, depending on the virus (5) . Small DNA viruses, including papillomaviruses and adenoviruses, modulate the host G 1 /S-phase transition to stimulate cell cycle-regulated transcription and/or S-phase DNA synthesis and thus support virus genome replication (5) (6) (7) . On the other hand, large DNA viruses such as the herpesviruses encode their own DNA synthetic apparatus and enzymes for nucleotide production. In the case of herpes simplex virus (HSV), in addition to seven essential replication proteins (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , other viral and host proteins localize to segregated replication compartments to promote origin-specific virus DNA replication (see review in reference 15). Moreover, HSV generally suppresses host cell DNA synthesis or blocks the transition from G 1 to S phase (12) and is thought to interfere with the cell cycle at several distinct phases (16) (17) (18) (19) ; reviewed in reference 20) .",

Apart from the well-known processes of paracrine/juxtacrine signaling to uninfected cells in antiviral responses, the prospect that additional modulation of other types of cellular metabolic processes occurs by paracrine signaling to uninfected cells has significant implications for our general understanding of virus-host interactions and the events which impinge on the outcome of infection.",

Here, we use such techniques to study the spatiotemporal distribution of virus and host cell DNA synthesis when infection is initiated in a single cell and followed by progressive transmission to neighboring cells. We show that while HSV disrupts host cell DNA synthesis and promotes virus DNA synthesis in the infected cell itself, it also induces paracrine signaling on control of host cell DNA synthesis in distant uninfected cells, resulting in a propagating wave of DNA synthesis in advance of virus infection. The results are relevant not only for HSV and potentially for viruses in general; they reveal differences in host cell processes when studied in progressive transmission models versus single-step growth cycles and could also indicate that similar events occur in other aspects of cellular metabolism, e.g., transcription and protein synthesis.",

The upper chamber base membrane, with an 0.02-m pore size, prevented virus migration through it, and in addition, the cells were plated in neutralizing serum for inhibition of any infectious virus passage through to the bottom chamber.

We initially evaluated the effect of EdC or EdU on the growth and doubling of uninfected cells and on HSV replication. There was a modest effect of EdU on both cell growth and virus yield but virtually no effect of EdC on plaque numbers and plaque size in multicycle analysis or virus yield in single-step analysis. We optimized protocols for nucleoside incorporation, click chemistry, and fluorescence detection as follows. Cells on coverslips were mock infected or infected with HSV by normal procedures (MOI, 10) and incubated in DMEM-2% NCS. At the times indicated, EdC was added at a final concentration of 5 M for a standard labeling time of 4 h unless otherwise stated. The cells were then washed in cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, quenched with glycine (0.3 M) or ammonium chloride (25 mM), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. For localization of specific antigens, an immunofluorescence assay with primary and secondary antibodies was carried out as described above. The samples were blocked in 10% calf serum and then subjected to click reaction in a buffer prepared freshly in each case (premixed for 2 min) and containing 10 M Alexa Fluor 488-azide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM CuSO 4 , 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM aminoguanidine, and 1 mM tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, pH 7.4. The reaction was then allowed to proceed by incubation at room temperature in the dark for 90 to 120 min. After washing in PBS, the cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) and coverslips were mounted in Mowiol supplemented with 2.5% DABCO. Images were taken as described above. For quantitation, total cell numbers were enumerated from the nuclear DAPI staining in one channel and EdC-positive cells were enumerated from nuclear staining (above background set in the absence of EdC). Images were quantitated manually (for total numbers and EdC-positive numbers) from the images or, for more quantitative assessment, using the thresholding and segmentation modules of Image Pro Plus. In this workflow, areas of individual objects (nuclei) are defined from the DAPI staining and then total intensity above background is reported in the corresponding object area for EdC incorporation. For the data in Fig. 7 , the range of counts for EdC intensity from minimum to maximum was binned and the numbers of cells in each bin were then returned. For these analyses, numerous independent fields and hundreds or thousands of cells were quantified.",

An example showing total DNA staining (DAPI) and EdC incorporation is shown in Fig. 2B . In contrast, in HSV-infected cells (multiplicity of infection, 10), virtually every cell was positive for EdC incorporation by 8 h after infection ( Fig. 2A, HSV) . The percentage of EdC-positive cells in several hundred cells is summarized in Fig. 2C , showing ongoing DNA synthesis in virtually every infected cell, compared to the approximately 30% observed in uninfected cells. Moreover, the pattern of incorporation in infected cells was qualitatively distinct from that seen in uninfected cells. An example is shown in Fig. 2D , showing total cell nuclei (DAPI), ICP8 localization, and EdC incorporation in the same field. The results show the previously documented features of HSV DNA replication compartments (12, 32, 33) , including EdC colocalization with the DNA replication protein ICP8 and exclusion from DAPI-dense areas of cellular DNA and areas adjacent to the nuclear rim where cellular DNA is marginated ( Fig. 2B and D, inset cell marked with arrow).

We next examined whether virus DNA synthesis could be detected after infection with a single initiating particle, i.e., at an extremely low multiplicity of infection where only one initially infected cell would be expected in several thousand cells. The results demonstrate that early after such infection (within 6 to 8 h), individual infected cells could be identified by the presence of ICP8 (Fig. 3A, ICP8, arrow) , surrounded by uninfected cells. The localization of EdC in such single infected cells was qualitatively distinct. A single focus of EdC incorporation within the nucleus was seen, usually at the periphery, combined with substantially reduced incorporation in the remainder of the nucleus (Fig. 3A , EdC, arrow, and DAPI/EdC, inset; see also single-focus inset in Fig. 7) . Such a pattern was observed only in ICP8-positive (ICP8\u03e9ve) cells and, consistent with previous data from high-multiplicity experiments (12) , represents a progressing virus DNA replication compartment, in this case emanating from a single genome beginning to replicate. The general reduction in EdC incorporation, outside the focus of the developing virus replication compartment itself, is consistent with previous data showing that HSV infection blocks cellular G 1 -to-S-phase progression in infected cells (12) . However, while our initial intention was to study spatial aspects of DNA synthesis in cells that had been initially infected by only a single particle, observations made during the course of these experiments directed the focus of our investigation to other processes, which are the subject of the remainder of this work.",

This gradient of DNA synthesis could be seen as early as 8 h after singleparticle infections. We repeated these experiments, pulse-labeling with EdC at a later time (20 to 24 h) when infection progressed to numerous cells (Fig. 4A) . The results show a pronounced zone of cells, surrounding the ICP8\u03e9ve infected cell boundary, in which elevated levels of DNA synthesis were observed with a gradient extending to distant cells. While levels of ongoing DNA synthesis were significantly increased in this zone, the percentage of cells synthesizing DNA remained similar to or only marginally increased over that seen in uninfected cell monolayers. This result was obtained independently of the virus antigen used to detect the central infected cells and in several cell types, including RSC and Vero cells (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material).",

Nevertheless, it remained possible, though unlikely, that events associated with infection could be involved. To rule this out, we examined singleparticle infection with a virus incapable of spreading to surrounding cells (27) . This virus, HSV-1.VP1-2\u232cNLS, when produced on complementing cells, can infect a cell and make particles, but these particles do not productively infect surrounding cells due to a defect in capsid transport (27) . Typical results are shown in Fig.  6B , where a single mutant virus-infected cell is detected expressing ICP8. In this infected cell, the single initiating virus replication compartment can be observed (Fig. 6B , EdC, arrow and inset). This cell is surrounded by cells exhibiting elevated DNA synthesis, with a gradient extending to more distant cells with no virus gene expression and which will not be infected. Since this mutant produces particles, albeit ones unable to productively infect cells, we repeated this regime with another disabled virus, HSV-1\u232cVP1-2.VP26.GFP, in which the VP1-2 gene is deleted and which does not assemble or release infectious particles (34), with similar results (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material).

To next pursue the possibility of a paracrine mechanism initiating from the infected cell, we used an insert culture system in which the infected effector cells were not in contact with the test cells. Cells grown in an insert containing a membrane with 20-nm pores were infected or mock infected (i.e., donor cells) and incubated with the recipient test cells in the lower chamber (Fig. 7A) . Approximately 20 h after infection, the inserts were removed and the test cells were pulse-labeled with EdC. The results (Fig. 7B ) demonstrate a significant increase in test cell DNA synthesis when exposed to HSV-infected donor medium compared to uninfected cell donor medium. This increase also showed a dose response in relation to the numbers of initially infected cells in the donor cell population (cf. test cell DNA synthesis levels when donor cells were infected at MOIs of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1). The results were quantified and expressed in numerous test cells, binned into ranges, and plotted for mock-infected or HSV-infected donor cells (Fig. 7C) . The results show a substantial increase in EdC incorporation in test cells exposed to donor medium from infected cells. This result cannot be explained by virus infection per se in the lower test chamber. First, infection would yield a focus of increased DNA synthesis emanating from an infected cell. This was not observed. Second, HSV will not pass through a 20-nmpore membrane. Third, the cultures were incubated in the pres-ence of neutralizing antibody. Finally, no virus-infected cells were detected in the test monolayer. Taken all together, our results indicate that, for induction of host DNA synthesis during progressive rounds of infection, the activated cells do not need to be in contact with infected cells and that a paracrine mechanism operates whereby signal(s), even from a single infected cell, promotes elevated DNA synthesis in surrounding uninfected cells.",

We have attempted to show, e.g., by increased plaque numbers or faster spread, that conditioned medium promotes more efficient infection but have not observed a significant increase in these parameters. It is possible that such an outcome may be demonstrated only under suboptimal conditions, e.g., with debilitated or poorly replicating viral mutants, where the efficiency of initiation of infection or the kinetics of spread may reveal an augmented outcome. It is also possible that any effect may not be readily demonstrable in the otherwise very permissive system of tissue culture infection by HSV. It may be that the physiological relevance of this paracrine effect is reflected more in the situation of initial infection in vivo or of reactivation in neuronal cells which are not normally transiting through S phase or surrounding supporting cells in the three-dimensional environment. Ultimately, investigation of the influence on the outcome of infection will require knowledge of the virus and/or host components involved in order to interfere with the pathway and explore the consequences. We note also that notwithstanding HSV repression of S-phase progression, many lines of evidence indicate a positive association between the cell cycle/cellular DNA synthesis and the outcome of herpesvirus replication. For example, cell cycle-dependent kinases are known to be required for replication of several herpesviruses, including HSV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (35, 36) ; HCMV manipulates quiescent cells, producing a pseudo-S-phase environment to support viral replication (37, 38) ; and certain viral proteins from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can actively stimulate E2F-responsive transcription and S-phase progression (39) .",

In terms of the processes within an infected cell itself to elicit the response in uninfected cells, preliminary data from assays in which single-particle infection was carried out in the presence of PAA, added from the time of infection, did not show infection to result in zones of elevated DNA synthesis surrounding the single infected cell.

It is possible that these processes are linked and that the stimulation in DNA synthesis observed here is integrated with other responses in vivo. Nonetheless, by quantitatively evaluating the percentage of S-phase cells in the zones exhibiting increased synthesis compared to total cell numbers in the zones (data not shown), we find little alteration from the percentage of S-phase cells in the uninfected cell population. The results may indicate that the process is not one advancing the G 1 -to-S onset or duration but rather one influencing the overall abundance of DNA synthesis in the cell. Such a mechanism might involve an increase in the efficiency of origin firing or in the suppression of certain cell cycle controls limiting DNA replication. It is noteworthy that adenovirus infection, which stimulates S-phase DNA synthesis, has been suggested to involve uncontrolled firing of DNA replication origins by suppressing cyclin A and geminin, which otherwise suppress genome rereplication (5, 41) . It is possible, therefore, that stimulation represents a perturbation of cell control mechanisms, e.g., in timing of origin firing or rereplication, rather than a stimulation of normal DNA synthesis.

            "text": "While a full mechanistic understanding awaits further analysis, these results on the process itself are immediately relevant for HSV, for herpesvirus biology, and potentially for other classes of viruses. They also reveal distinct differences in host cell processes studied in progressive transmission models versus single-step growth cycles and could also indicate that similar events take place in other aspects of cellular metabolism, including, for example, transcription and protein synthesis. We propose, therefore, that these observations advance our fundamental concepts about processes involved in perturbation of host processes during virus infection. They are likely to be highly relevant in the broader virology context and, while raising many questions, open new lines of investigation on the diverse pathways by which viruses manipulate host processes to influence infection outcome and disease progression.",

Multiple images were captured on a motorized stage and tiled together into one image covering a quarter of the entire dish and showing 5 developing foci of virus spread, all exhibiting elevated DNA synthesis in the extended boundary beyond virus infection. were pulsed with EdC at 20 h, washed and incubated for a further 20 h to allow virus progression, and then pulsed again with EdC and analyzed. We anticipated that if induction of DNA synthesis was maintained, we should see a second external zone of elevated DNA synthesis surrounding the infected cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, this is exactly what was observed. (The various zones defined below are labeled only on the EdC panel for ease of inspection.)",
