Airborne transmission of bacteria and viruses originating from aerosolized particles from defecating and vomiting individuals has been previously reported [11, 12] . Furthermore, farms located in close proximity to a known infected farm have increased odds of being PEDV infected. Recently, detection of PEDV RNA attributed to airborne spread within a space housing experimentally infected pigs was reported [13] . However, because sentinel pigs did not succumb to PEDV infection, airborne transmission was not confirmed. Based on the hypothesis that PEDV particles can be suspended in the air and remain infectious while airborne, our objective was to determine whether infectious PEDV could be detected in air samples under both experimental and field conditions.",

Briefly, twelve 7 to 8 week-old PEDV-na\u00efve pigs were housed in a 35 m 3 BSL-2 animal isolation unit at the University of Minnesota. Prior to inoculation pigs were tested by RT-PCR to confirm their PEDV negative status. On day 0 of the study, each pig was intragastrically inoculated with 20 mL of PEDV inoculum calculated from preliminary pilot studies as an adequate volume to properly deliver the samples without over-filling the stomach. The inoculum was derived from mucosal scrapings of a PEDV case submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UMVDL). The inoculation material was confirmed positive by PEDV RT-PCR and diluted to an estimated number of RNA copies/mL, based on a standard curve, ranging from 3.96 \u00d7 10 10 to 7.57 \u00d7 10 10 (corresponding to values of 15 to 16 cycle threshold or Ct). The inoculation material was prepared and kept refrigerated for 24 h at 4\u00b0C prior to inoculation. After inoculation, clinical signs of PEDV infection including body temperature, diarrhea, vomiting and lethargy were recorded for 3 days at each sampling event from 24 h post challenge. Air samples were collected by placing a cyclonic air collector (Midwest Micro-Tek, Brookings, SD, USA) in the center of the isolation room 1.2 m above the floor. Pigs did not have direct access to the air sampler. Samples were collected for 30 min into 10 mL of viral growth media (minimum essential media (MEM) supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum) placed in the air cyclonic collection vessel as previously described [14] . Samples were collected twice daily (morning and afternoon) and two air samplers were used between sampling events to enable effective disinfection of the devices. Pre-collection negative controls were taken by swabbing the collector vessel and spinning mechanism using a sterile swab with Stuart's medium (BBL CultureSwab\u2122, Dickinson and Com., Sparks, Maryland, USA). After collection, samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until the termination of the study when all samples were submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UMN VDL) for PCR analysis.",

The sensitivity of the bioassay protocol was previously demonstrated with an infectious dose serial dilution pilot study tested in piglets of the same age and number of piglets per sample used in this study (unpublished data). Briefly, 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. On arrival pigs were rectal swabbed and confirmed negative by PEDV RT-PCR. Inoculation material per pig consisted of a 2 mL of a single sample (field samples) or a 2 mL pool from 3 samples (experimental samples) diluted 1:10 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to obtain a total of 20 mL of inoculation material per pig. Pigs were inoculated after 1 day of acclimatization via gavage using a Kendall 16 inch #14 French nasoesophageal tube placed orally into the esophagus. Entry of the tube into the stomach was confirmed by negative pressure with a 20 mL syringe on the esophageal tube. Procedures described in this study followed approved protocols by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol number 1110A5802, and Institutional Biosafety Committee protocol number 1208H18341.",

Once PEDV diagnosis was confirmed the infection spread very rapidly among swine herds causing devastating losses to producers. Because of the rapid spread of the virus among farms, aerosol transmission was suspected in some areas where virus transmission could not be explained by any other known routes. In our study, we assessed the detection and viability of PEDV in air samples collected from a room housing experimentally infected PEDV pigs. Pigs inoculated with diluted air samples developed PED clinical signs and lesions and PEDV was detected in feces and tissues indicating that air samples contained infectious PEDV. Secondly, we investigated the transport of PEDV under field conditions and we showed that PEDV genetic material could be detected up to 10 miles although infectivity could not be shown. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to establish that PEDV can be found in the air, that suspended airborne particles can be infectious, and that PEDV genetic material can be transported over long distances.",

Drying of swine feces due to increase in temperature and resuspension of feed deposited on the floor of pig buildings can result in the generation of dust able to adsorb and carry microorganisms and odorous compounds [11] . We speculate that this is one likely mechanism by which PEDV became aerosolized and remained suspended in the air, and may contribute to both within farm transmission and area spread in high density pig regions. Furthermore, PEDV has a low infectivity dose and is able to survive in the environment for extended periods facilitating the risk of disease transmission [15] .",

            "text": "Control samples included a sample collected from a PEDV confirmed positive pig with a Ct value of 16 (positive control), one sample diluted 10 \u22127 times from the positive control (intended Ct 36-38), and one negative control sample consisting of sterile PBS. Clinical signs of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were monitored every 12 h throughout the bioassay. All pigs were euthanized 48 h post-exposure by injection of 2 mL of pentobarbital (Fatal-Plus\u00ae, 100 mg/kg IV) into the external jugular vein. Intestines were removed immediately and sections of jejunum and ileum from 6 different areas were collected for histopathological and PCR analysis. Both tissue and air samples were tested by real time RT-PCR. Briefly, RNA was extracted from intestinal and environmental samples using the MagMAX\u2122-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Molecular detection of PEDV by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) used spike gene primers (Forward 1910: ACGTCCCTTTACTTTCAATTCACA and Reverse 2012: TATACTTGG TACACACATCCAGAGTCA) and probe (1939: FAM-TGAGTTGATTACTGGCACGCCT AA ACCAC-BHQ). The primer and hydrolysis probe set utilized the AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Reagents (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 5 \u03bcL of RNA with the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) on the Fast Mode setting under the following thermal cycling conditions, reverse transcription, 10 min at 48\u00b0C; Taq activation, 10 min at 95\u00b0C; followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 45 s at 60\u00b0C. A gBlocks Gene Fragments (IDT) containing the PEDV gene target was ordered and a 10 fold serial dilution was run on the PEDV RT-qPCR generating a standard curve with a slope of y = 9E = 12e -0.648x , which was used to transform the Ct values into estimated copies of PEDV RNA per mL of original material.",
