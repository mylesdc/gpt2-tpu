            "text": "Past outbreaks have been of limited size affecting a local population, however a strain of EBOV-Z is the causative agent of the current outbreak that began in late 2013 and has since become an unprecedented and devastating epidemic 3,4 , resulting in over 20,000 suspected cases, of which those confirmed had a case fatality rate of around 60% in the afflicted West African countries (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-20150107?lang=en and http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ situation-reports/en/). Towards the end of 2014 the trend in case numbers reversed in Liberia and the epidemic slowed in Sierra Leone and Guinea, but the virus continues to transit in new geographical areas 5 . This epidemic has triggered a significant global health response relying on primary hygiene and other containment measures that have proved successful in limiting the spread of the virus in previous outbreaks. Given the scale of this outbreak and the fear that traditional containment measures may fail to prevent global spread, several vaccines have been fast-tracked into phase I clinical trials 6-8 although even if proved efficacious, the limited supply of sufficient quantities of vaccine will hinder their use in the current situation. For disease treatment, patients suffering a haemorrhagic fever have relied on the clinical management of symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/treatment/). with a handful of patients in this outbreak receiving experimental therapies such as ZMapp, TKM-Ebola, brincidofovir and favipiravir (http://www.nature.com/news/ebola-trials-to-start-in-december-1.16342) 9-12 . Alternatively antibody treatment by transfusion therapy using blood or plasma from Ebola virus survivors has been approved 11,13-16 ; although issues with safety and lack of resources for this method limit its suitability in West Africa today. Having no approved or widely available therapeutics for EBOV, as with many other emerging viral diseases, focus has turned to possible re-purposing of drugs already licensed for other uses by the EMA and FDA. Several clinically approved drugs have been identified by researchers 17-20 , including amiodarone, one of the several cationic amphiphiles found to inhibit filovirus entry which is currently being trialled in Sierra Leone 21 . However reservations have been expressed about the complications that could be caused by side effects of the drug in EBOV patients. The anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ) has also been shown to inhibit EBOV entry and protected mice from EBOV infection 18, 22 and has been previously highlighted as a possible drug to treat EBOV infection 11 .",

Therefore it is important to try and understand the mechanism of virus inhibition by such drugs. To this end we re-examined the anti-viral properties of CQ, and show here that it inhibited the pH-dependent endosomal entry of a pseudotyped virus (PV) bearing EBOV glycoproteins, in the same way as did the potent and specific vacuolar-ATPase (vATPase) inhibitor bafilyomycin A1 (BafA1) (a non-medical laboratory compound). We also show that licensed and widely used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for treatment of gastric acid reflux, omeprazole (OM) and esomeprazole (ESOM), inhibited PV EBOV entry, likely by their off-target inhibitory activity on endosomal vATPase.",

A549 cells were chosen here because 293T cells are poorly imaged due to their morphology. The lysotracker probe specifically fluoresces in acidic organelles. Fluorescence was decreased in cells treated with BafA1 and CQ in a dose dependant manner, but was unaffected in cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 2 ).

Preventing this action by fusion inhibitors has been successful approach for HIV antiviral therapy 34 . Unlike HIV, EBOV and many other viruses are dependent on the naturally low pH of acidic endosomes to activate and trigger fusion by their envelope glycoproteins. In this instance, a 'fusion inhibitor' could target the host cell machinery preventing acidification of the endosome, working to inhibit virus entry of several different viruses. Here we have reiterated that cell entry by PVs representing EBOV, FLU-H5 and MARV can be inhibited by increasing the endosome pH using BafA1 and CQ (Figure 1) , and this correlates with their ability to prevent the acidification of intracellular organelles (Figure 2 ).",

Disappointingly, this antiviral activity has not always translated into efficacy in vivo models or clinical trials, although CQ was effective in a mouse model against EBOV 18, 35, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . The variability in in vivo results may depend on study design and strains of virus used. In one study BafA1 treated mice were not protected from influenza infection but treatment with a related compound, SaliPhe, was protective, even though both drugs were potent in vitro 43 . Inhibition of endosome acidification as a target for inhibiting EBOV can be justified by the knowledge that the filoviruses depend on the low pH for two separate steps of their entry pathway. Not only is the fusion by G protein triggered by low pH, but its cleavage into a fusogenic form is carried out by endosomal enzymes cathepsins B and L whose activation is also pH dependent 44 . Some have argued that G protein cleavage by cathepsin is less essential than previously thought 45, 46 and that EBOV species other than Zaire together with closely related MARV do not require cathepsin cleavage for entry 47, 48 . Nonetheless, entry of MARV PVs was still inhibited in our assays suggesting that inhibiting fusion alone is sufficient.",

            "text": "CQ has been used for many years as an anti-malarial drug, although it is now only effective in parts of central America and the Caribbean due to accumulation of drug resistance by the plasmodium parasite 53 . Interestingly, compounds belonging to the omeprazole family have also been described as having anti-malarial properties in vitro, possibly via their reported ability to target vATPase in the plasma membrane of Plasmodium parasite 54 . Soon after its discovery OM was found to also inhibit intracellular vATPase at \u00b5M concentrations as opposed to its licensed target of gastric H+/ K+-ATPase against which it is effective at much lower concentrations 32,33 . Indeed there are a plethora of publications indicating use of OM and ESOM in cancer therapy, as a means to inhibit the characteristic acidic intracellular environment, and thus permit sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . A role of OM and ESOM has also been noted in the suppression of bone resorption, another physiological process dependent on pH [60] [61] [62] . Given the volume of research suggesting these off target effects depend on an ability to affect intracellular pH, we hypothesised that these drugs would, like CQ and BafA1, inhibit EBOV, MARV and influenza virus pH dependent entry. We used GALV as a control again since its entry is reportedly independent of pH. Indeed, EBOV, FLU-H5 and MARV were inhibited by lower doses of OM or ESOM than GALV ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). GALV entry was also inhibited at the highest concentration, but we cannot exclude that this was due to a toxic effect that was not measured by the Renilla control we employed here. We did not observe as close a correlation between drug doses that mediated the inhibition of EBOV or influenza PV entry and increase in pH of intracellular vesicles for OM and ESOM as for CQ and BafA, (Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). More recently, it has been reported that OM and ESOM altered the localisation of vATPase in the cell as well as the pH of intracellular vesicles 46 and this may explain their ability to inhibit PV entry more potently than the pH changes we observed would suggest.",

            "text": "Inhibition of influenza virus entry to cells by means of inhibiting acidification of endosomes has been known for decades 63 , although no current antivirals for influenza have been licensed on this basis. Some epidemiological evidence from population studies suggests that OM could exert a protective effect against influenza-likeillness 64 , but our studies suggest that doses required for potent inhibition might be difficult to achieve without significant toxicity. Despite these drugs being readily available, even without prescription in some countries, the licensed dosing would generate a plasma concentration reportedly 1.59-9.61\u00b5M for ESOM that falls short of the IC 50 calculated in this study, although higher doses have been used clinically 65 . Therefore it seems unlikely that OM and ESOM would be a suitable therapy for ebolavirus infection, but more specifically designed vATPase inhibitors may have potential as broad acting antivirals against several emerging viruses in the future. With regard to CQ, the evidence suggests a more promising position for use against ebolavirus. Standard adult dosing (25mg/kg) achieves plasma concentration of 2\u00b5M, close to our IC 50 value against EBOV PV entry. Protection in the mouse model was previously shown with a 90mg/kg dosage 18,66 . Using re-purposed drugs to treat outbreaks of emerging diseases must surely be approached with caution. In Ebola patients with severe life-threatening disease it would be important to ensure that any side effects of a therapy did not enhance disease progression, particularly if higher doses of re-purposed drugs, as suggested here, were considered. On the other hand, CQ has been taken prophylactically in a tropical setting for many years to prevent malaria and we suggest that, with little additional need for scale up of production of a new agent, this might represent a useful adjunct to the current antiviral strategies being trialled in West Africa. We envisage that in contacts of EBOV cases, CQ might decrease the viral load that establishes in the early days after virus transmission. Further work in in vivo models including guinea pig and primates should inform about doses and administration regimens. Author contributions Dr Jason Long, Dr Edward Wright and Dr Eleonora Molesti generated the PVs. Jason Long performed the drug entry assay and pH assay.

This is an elegant study employing envelope pseudotypes of highly pathogenic viruses which demonstrates that certain inhibitors of low endosomal pH can inhibit viral entry. Because some of these molecules such as Chloroquine have been in clinical use for decades, and are inexpensive, they might tip the balance between survival and death during human infection.I have no criticism of the experimental work. However, I have been told by a reliable physician who has recently cared for patients with Ebola infection that treatment with Chloroquine offered no clinical benefit. Thus it is possible that an observation may not translate into a useful treatment . So one in vitro in vivo should be wary about the conclusions.",
