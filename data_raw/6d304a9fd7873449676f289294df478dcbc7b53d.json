            "text": "Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, best known for causing diarrhea in humans and are also found in many other mammals; in those, the relevance in gastroenteritis remains unclear. Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species' fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide-and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants' feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission. The findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown AstV in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of AstV in small ruminants.",

The AstV genome is 6.2-7.8 kb in size and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. It presents at least three open reading frames (ORF): ORF1a, ORF1ab, and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1ab encode nonstructural precursor proteins, nsp1a, and nsp1ab. The latter is translated via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism, where ORF1b is translated together with ORF1a (Marczinke et al., 1994) . ORF2 encodes the capsid precursor protein, which is then intra-and extracellularly further processed to mature structural proteins .",

Due to the availability of high throughput next-generation-sequencing (NGS) technologies and the use of broadly reactive Pan-AstV RT-PCR protocols, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of AstV discovered in diverse species during the last years . AstV were first described in 1975 in a human stool sample (Appleton & Higgins, 1975; Madeley & Cosgrove, 1975) . In humans, AstV are best known as a major source of outbreaks of gastroenteritis, especially in infants, young children and immunocompromised people (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Fischer, Pinho Dos Reis & Balkema-Buschmann, 2017) . However, intestinal tissue infected with AstV shows only minor histological changes such as a mild intestinal inflammatory response (Sebire et al., 2004) and the knowledge on the pathogenesis of gastroenteric disease associated with AstV is still limited (Moser & Schultz-Cherry, 2005) .",

Even though the presence of ovine astroviruses (OvAstV) in fecal sheep samples constituted the first report of AstV in animals (Snodgrass & Gray, 1977) , still little is known about AstV infections in small ruminants, their transmission within and across species as well as their association with disease. In recent years a wide variety of mammalian domestic animal species were found positive for AstV in their feces; for example, cattle (Woode & Bridger, 1978) , sheep (Snodgrass & Gray, 1977) , red deer (Tzipori, Menzies & Gray, 1981) , takins (Guan et al., 2018) and also domestic carnivores (Hoshino et al., 1981; Williams, 1980) , mice (Kjeldsberg & Hem, 1985) , and pigs (Bridger, 1980) , but their role in the context of disease remained largely unclear. Remarkably, almost at the same time as the discovery of the first AstV-associated encephalitis in humans, the so-called shaking mink syndrome was described, which could be traced back to neurovirulent AstV infection (Blomstrom et al., 2010) . One year later, in 2011, a neurovirulent porcine AstV type 3 could be identified as the cause of disease in outbreaks of meningoencephalomyelitis in piglets (Arruda et al., 2017; Boros et al., 2017) .",

In Switzerland, three neurotropic AstV were identified in brain-tissue of ruminants; bovine astrovirus CH13 (BoAstV-CH13) and bovine astrovirus CH15 (BoAstV-CH15) in cattle (Bouzalas et al., 2014; Seuberlich et al., 2016) , as well as ovine astrovirus CH16 (OvAstV-CH16) in sheep. The capsid protein as well as the non-structural proteins of this encephalitis-associated AstV in sheep (OvAstV-CH16) show a high similarity-around 99% on both the nucleotide and the amino acid level-to BoAstV-CH15, suggesting interspecies transmission of this genotype species between sheep and cattle .",

Partial sequences generated from goat feces cluster together with the here described CapAstV/OvAstV or with enterotropic strains from other ruminants. In the partial sequences generated from sheep and deer feces, the situation is similar to the one described in goats. As previously indicated, one partial sequence, S3.1, is not clustering close to other enterotropic AstV but rather near the neurotropic BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 cluster. In samples with multiple AstV hits, partial sequences cluster at different positions of the phylogenetic tree. OvAstV-S5.1 clusters together with CapAstV-G5.1/OvAstV-S6.1 and S4.1, while scaffold S5.2, detected in the same sample, clusters together with sequences from sample G8 (G8.3/G8.5).",

These novel AstV show a broad genetic diversity compared to AstV affecting other species. The present results support interspecies transmission of AstV between goats and sheep, as well as recombination events between AstV affecting sheep, goats and cattle. The aims of the study were to investigate the potential shedding of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants' feces, to discover and to analyze unknown AstV, and examine a putative interspecies transmission. Therefore, all available samples first were screened for the neurotropic AstV BoAstV-CH13 as well as BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16. Three different methods were then applied, first, highly specific RT-qPCR, second, a widespectrum RT-PCR, and third, NGS of all samples interpreted as positive after RT-PCR. None of these samples could be defined as positive for BoAstV-CH13 or BoAstV-CH15/ OvAstV-CH16. Thus, there is no evidence that neurotropic AstV are part of the intestinal virome of small ruminants. Noteworthy, limitations of this study are the relative small number of samples investigated, the unknown disease status of the animals and the focus mainly on sheep and goats due to a lack of available samples from other ruminant species. A related study targeting feces and brain of cattle was reported previously (Oem & An, 2014) .",

However, RNA viruses, and in particular AstV, are predicted to undergo 3.4 \u00c2 10 -3 mutations per nucleotide per genomic replication (Duffy, Shackelton & Holmes, 2008) and are genetically relatively diverse. Therefore, this RT-PCR uses highly degenerated primers, which has the limitations that (i) it may lack sensitivity; due to absence or inefficiency of primer binding to divergent AstV sequences and that (ii) unspecific primer binding may result in amplification of non-AstV sequences. On the one hand, as only RT-PCR positive samples were submitted to NGS, fecal samples containing divergent AstV strains may have been classified as false negative and therefore might have been excluded from further analysis. On the other hand, false positive samples may have been further analyzed by NGS. Indeed, seven RT-PCR positive samples did not reveal any AstV hit in the bioinformatics pipeline. This discrepancy may also be related to the sample pretreatment procedure prior to NGS-submission.",

Attempts to confirm the sequence of this scaffold by RT-PCR, cloning and further sequencing approaches remained unsuccessful. This may be due to the low viral load or PCR inhibitors in small ruminants' feces that interfere with amplification. The importance of this finding is so far unclear. With an identity of 57% on the amino acid level to BoAstV-CH13, this putative AstV would be part of the so-called human-mink-ovine-like clade, which also comprises the fecal OvAstV-1 strain as well as the vast majority of encephalitis-associated strains in humans and animals (Kapoor et al., 2009; Reuter, Pankovics & Boros, 2018) . Given the fact that only a part of the sequence (967 nt) could be determined, it is still possible that this virus shows varying identities depending on the genome section compared to other viral sequences.

Indeed, sequence similarities compared to best hits in the database entries on protein-level were between 39.3% and 96.4 % (median 72.7%). A total of 15 scaffolds covered at least a part of the ORF2 and therefore underwent phylogenetic analysis based on the capsid protein precursor sequence together with the five newly identified full-length or almost full-length AstV genomes (Fig. 2) . This analysis clearly points out the broad diversity of putative AstV detected in this study. Novel sequences were not only discovered in sheep and goat, but also in deer (D2.1, D5.1), interestingly showing a low similarity to known AstV in deer (CcAstV-1/DNK/2010, CcAstV-2/DNK/2010). In addition, several sequences found in sheep show a clearly higher identity to bovine AstV than to ovine AstV (e.g., S6.3 \u00c3 to BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido12-25/2009). Taken together, these results clearly suggest a much larger diversity of AstV in small ruminants and deer than known to date. Moreover, the occurrence of multiple phylogenetically different AstV-like scaffolds in the same sample in most of these animals (e.g., in G1, G8 and S6) supports that AstV coinfections are frequent.",

Noteworthy, this study reports for the first time an AstV infection in goats.

According to the ICTV 9th report 2011 (Bosch et al., 2011) , amino acid differences between AstV genotype species are >0.338. Based on this criterion, the strains described in this study belong to three AstV genotype species: (i) CapAstV-G2.1 together with BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009, (ii) CapAstV-G3.1 on its own, and (iii) CapAstV-G5.1 together with OvAstV-S5.1 as well as OvAstV-S6.1. While CapAstV-G2.1 belongs to the same genotype species as BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009, CapAstV-G3.1 is sufficiently diverse to build a new genotype species on its own. In particular, CapAstV-G5.1 and OvAstV-S6.1 were very similar to each other, not only in the capsid protein sequence (97.3%), but also in the predicted non-structural proteins (90.3%) and on full-length genome nucleotide level (87.6%) ( Table S3 ).

Not only was recombination predicted for OvAstV-S6.1, OvAstV-S5.1 and CapAstV-G5.1, but also for CapAstV-G2.1 and two divergent bovine AstV (BoAstV/ JPN/Hokkaido11-55/2009, BAstV-GX27/CHN/2014), suggesting that these viruses (or close relatives to those strains) shared the same host at some time point during evolution ( Fig. 3; Table S4 ). Similar recombination events have been proposed between a porcine AstV and HAstV-3 (Ulloa & Gutierrez, 2010) . In addition, the transmission of fecal AstV between cattle and roe deer has been suggested (Smits et al., 2010; Tse et al., 2011) .
