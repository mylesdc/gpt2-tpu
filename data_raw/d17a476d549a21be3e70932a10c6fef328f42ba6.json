In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC 50 values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity.",

We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. Conclusions: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.",

These glycoproteins are the most prominent features of the viral surface that can be recognized within the host cellular background and are targeted for antibody neutralization. Consequently, viruses have evolved a number of strategies for shielding the spike structures formed by their surface glycoproteins. These strategies include restriction of access to conserved structural features through conformational occlusion and oligomerization [2, 3] , sequence hyper-variability, especially within loops that mask conserved epitopes [4] , and extensive posttranslational glycosylation [5] .",

This glycan armor hides the underlying protein structures on one face of gp120, whereas the epitopes on the other face of gp120 are masked by the quaternary structure of the trimeric spike [7] . The effectiveness of glycans in this defensive mechanism may in part hinge on the generally weak interactions between proteins and carbohydrates [8] . The glycan modifications of HIV Env are also essential for its folding and function [9, 10] . Evolution of mutations in the position and frequency of N-linked glycans on the HIV spike is a contributing factor to viral escape during the course of infection and appears to occur within limits affected by immune evasion, efficient processing, and access to receptor binding sites [11] . Logically, mu that would reduce the glycosylation levels of HIV Env could affect viral processing and maturation, leading to attenuated infectivity, as well as further exposing the virus to the immune system. Therefore, targeting this viral glycan shield may be an effective way of combating HIV infection.",

A number of lectins have been shown to display potent antiviral activity [12] . Currently, the most potent reported anti-HIV lectin is griffithsin (GRFT), an obligate domainswapped dimer in which each domain has jacalin-like fold ( Figure 1A ) [13] . GRFT has anti-HIV EC 50 of~50 pM in cell-based assays [14] and exhibits synergistic effects against HIV in combination with other antiviral agents [15] [16] [17] . Additionally, GRFT has been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against the coronavirus responsible for SARS [18, 19] , the hepatitis C virus [20] , the Japanese encephalitis virus [21] , and the murine herpes simplex virus type 2 [22] . There are a number of characteristics that make GRFT an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic. GRFT is thermostable, can survive in a wide range of conditions including those found in the macaque vaginal environment, and exhibits little or no toxicity and immunogenicity [23] . Subcutaneous administration of GRFT in rodent models has also shown that this lectin accumulates to therapeutically effective levels in serum and plasma with minimal toxicity [24] . Finally, low-cost, large-scale production of GRFT in genetically modified tobacco plants has been demonstrated [25] .",

We also engineered several monomeric forms of GRFT (mGRFT) ( Figure 1B ) and determined their structures, including the structure of a complex with nonamannoside, an analogue of Man9 that forms a common glycosylation pattern found on HIV surface glycoproteins [29] . The anti-HIV activity of mGRFT was approximately 1000-fold lower than that of GRFT, although both the monomeric and dimeric forms of this lectin have very similar oligosaccharide-binding affinities. Therefore, we suggested that the presence of two binding domains in native, dimeric GRFT was important for its activity by allowing the cross-linking of gp120-associated oligosaccharides. Such a mechanism could also lead to the agglutination of HIV virions [30] . We hypothesized that providing more flexibility and varying the distance between the two domains might improve antiviral properties of the derivatives of GRFT.",

Since 4mGRFT exhibited no better activity than 3mGRFT in anti-HIV assays, it was not investigated further. The gp120 binding of 2mGRFT, 2mGRFT3, and 3mGRFT was fully characterized and the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions are detailed in Table 3 . Binding of gp120 to the mGRFT tandemers was revealed to be exothermic in nature. The exothermic heats of interaction (negative \u0394H values; Table 2 ) were likely due to polar and electrostatic interactions between mGRFT domains and the high-mannose oligosaccharides of gp120. As reported previously for the binding between GRFT and high-mannose oligosacharides [30] , an enthalpy-entropy compensation was apparent, indicating that the favorable binding contacts between GRFT and gp120 had overcome the unfavorable conformational penalties of the bound partners and the unfavorable entropy of water (negative T\u0394S values; Table 3 ) at the interface and around the bound complex, resulting in energetically-favored binding with gp120 (negative \u0394G values; Table 3 ). The observed tight, nanomolar binding affinities were close to the accuracy limits of the calorimetric instrument but well within the experimental error and the calculated K d values (Table 3 ), showed that the mGRFT tandemers bound gp120 with slightly stronger affinity than GRFT. Particularly in the case of the 2mGRFT3 and 3mGRFT constructs, a 3 nM K d value was calculated for both tandemers. Deconstruction of the gp120 binding affinities into their respective enthalpic and entropic contributions provided further insight into the nature of the binding between the mGRFT tandemers and gp120. From an examination of the enthalpy of binding (\u0394H) it was clear that the mGRFT tandemers mediated a higher number of binding contacts with gp120 than did GRFT (Table 3) .",

It was clear from the enthalpy-entropy compensation that the mGRFT tandemers either did not form large aggregates with gp120, or if they did, the crosslinked complexes were soluble and flexible enough to prevent any great degree of trapping of the solvent water molecules. The gp120 titrated solutions of the mGRFT tandemers were far less cloudy than the post-titration solution of GRFT, suggesting that little or no crosslinked aggregation had taken place.

To determine if this was true and to evaluate the role that the enhanced flexibility in binding domains may play in this phenomenon, we used dynamic light scattering to measure the aggregation of HIV-1 BAL virions after treatment with mGRFT, GRFT, or one of the four GRFT tandemers. As shown in Figure 4 , GRFT did aggregate HIV-1 BAL virions to a significant extent when compared to untreated virions. As expected, mGRFT, with only a single binding domain, did not aggregate virions but, interestingly, also none of the GRFT tandemers, including 4mGRFT with its four binding domains, caused virions to aggregate.",

These aggregates appear in the micrograph as large electron-dense swathes. Individual virions could be identified at the periphery of the aggregates, and though they seem to maintain their membrane integrity, their shapes were highly distorted.

The mGRFT tandemers displayed mutually similar effects on HIV-1 virions and envelope glycoproteins (Figures 5J, K, I, and M, respectively), but differed significantly from virions treated with GRFT.

The first 15 residues of each monomer form a strand-loop-strand structure that completes the \u03b2-prism-II fold of the opposite monomer. Each \u03b2-prism harbors three carbohydrate-binding sites on one of the terminal facets of the prism. The centers of the carbohydrate-binding sites form an equilateral triangle with 15 \u00c5 sides. The domains are oriented at a~160\u00b0angle from each other, with the centers of the triangular carbohydrate-binding surfaces positioned 50 \u00c5 apart ( Figure 1A ). The orientation of the domains is fixed, since the dimer is formed by domain swapping involving two \u03b2 strands, resulting in a rigid molecule [26] [27] [28] The three carbohydrate-binding sites on the surface of each domain act as a selective mechanism for specifically targeting high-mannose, branched carbohydrate environments typically found on viral envelope glycoproteins [40] . Viral glycoproteins present a preponderance of high mannose oligosaccharides when compared to human cellular glycoproteins, which have a larger proportion of sialylated oligosaccharides. Alignments of glycans identified on gp120 in vitro [6, 41] with N-linked sequon variations of gp120 identified in silico suggests that high-mannose modifications dominate the conserved regions of gp120 [11] .",

In native GRFT the distance between the centers of the carbohydrate-binding regions on each domain was~50 \u00c5 ( Figure 1A ). Increasing the linear length of the mGRFT tandemers from~70 \u00c5 (2mGRFT) to~90 \u00c5 (2mGRFT3) resulted in a nearly identical or slightly worse anti-HIV activity overall, suggesting that this increase in potential distance between mGRFT domains was not a determining factor in anti-HIV potency. Increasing the number of mGRFT domains did enhance antiviral activity. However, this effect was limited to three mGRFT domains as evidenced from the nearly identical anti-HIV activities of 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT (Tables 1 and 2) . The limit on the number of mGRFT domains was possibly due to geometric constraints that could limit access to glycan ligands by the fourth mGRFT domain of 4mGRFT and/or saturation of local viral oligosaccharides with mGRFT domains.",

The dimeric structure of native GRFT enhanced its anti-HIV activity by orders of magnitude but also led to viral aggregation. While this aggregation is a possible contributing factor to the antiviral activity of native GRFT, the ability to cause aggregation is clearly not the determining factor for the anti-HIV activity of the mGRFT tandemers. This was evident from both the electron microscopy and light scattering results for HIV treated with the four tandemers.

In the case of the mGRFT tandemers, after binding of the first mGRFT domain to an Env spike, the flexible linkers would allow the remaining mGRFT domains to more readily sample the local environment and bind to the nearest available carbohydrate ligand. The local concentration of ligands available for subsequent mGRFT domains is potentially higher on the same spike than in the overall solution. Therefore, the mGRFT tandemers, owing to the flexibility of their linkers, are more likely to bind glycans on the same virion, whereas native GRFT, due to its conformational rigidity, would more favor inter-virion crosslinking.",

The antiviral activity of GRFT, mGRFT, and the mGRFT tandemers stems from their selective binding to high mannose oligosaccharides on Env spikes. Natural mutations that removed glycosylation at positions Asn234 and Asn295 have been reported to impart resistance to GRFT [43] . In addition, Huang et al. showed that deglycosylation of gp120 at Asn295 or Asn448 also resulted in resistance to GRFT [44] . The location of these oligosaccharide attachment sites on gp120 are shown in Figure 6 . To investigate the role of specific oligosaccharides in the sensitivity to GRFT tandemers, we utilized genetically-engineered pseudotype viruses including either HIV-1 clade B CAAN5342 gp120 ( Figure 3A ) or clade C CAP206.8 gp120 ( Figure 3B ) sequences. We tested both strains in either the presence or absence of oligosaccharide attachment sites at positions 234 N and 295 N of the gp120 protein. Figure 3 displays the results of our assessment of the activity of either wild-type GRFT, mGRFT, or mGRFT tandemers against these viruses. The 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT tandemers retain significantly more activity against wild-type GRFTresistant viruses than the 2mGRFT, 2mGRFT3, or wild-type GRFT. We speculate that this increased activity against resistant viruses is due to the ability of these larger mGRFT tandemers to sample a broader range of oligosaccharides on gp120 than the smaller mGRFT tandemers or the conformationally-restricted wild-type GRFT.",

The arrangement of the griffithsin monomers in the mGRFT tandemers is such that they are able to bind carbohydrate moieties on the same virion, but not in a way that bridges separate virions, as demonstrated by the tomographic and light scattering experiments. Given the molecular dimensions of the mGRFT tandemers (<100 \u00c5 across), and the fact that neighboring spikes on the virus are spaced apart by significantly greater and variable distances (each trimeric Env itself is1 50 \u00c5 across), it follows that the multiple sites on the mGRFT tandemers are occupied by carbohydrates that are displayed within the same Env trimer, with a high likelihood of crosslinking across protomers within the trimer. Cryo-electron microscopic studies have shown that CD4-induced opening of the trimeric Env spike is necessary for exposure of gp41 that initiates the first step in the fusion of viral and target cell membranes [34, 36, 46] . The crosslinking of gp120 protomers may essentially block the opening of the trimeric spike and prevent exposure of gp41 and its fusogenic components required for viral entry, thus providing a likely mechanism for the potent function of GRFT and mGRFT tandemers as antiviral agents.",

The concentrations of all tandemer proteins were determined by amino acid analysis, and a 60 \u03bcM concentrated sample of a tandemer protein was evaluated per experiment. By routine protocol, buffer (50 mM Tris, 60 mM NaCl) was introduced to both the reference and sample cells and the calorimeter was allowed to ramp through one cycle of a heat-cool cycle (10\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C) at a heating/cooling rate of 60\u00b0C/hr. During the down scan at 25\u00b0C, the buffer solution from the sample cell was quickly and efficiently replaced with a degassed tandemer protein sample. The entire system was re-pressurized to approximately 30 psi of positive pressure to prevent evaporation at higher temperatures, and the experiment was allowed to continue. A total of 6 alternating up-down scans (10\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C) were performed to measure possible reversibility of folding/unfolding of the tandemers. According to manufacturing protocol, Origin DSC Analysis software was used to correct for buffer effects and to carry out the integration of the unfolding transitions of the tandemers. The baseline corrected thermograms were fitted to a two-state melting model and the calorimetric transition enthalpy (\u0394H unf ) was obtained from the area under the excess heat capacity peak, the midpoint of the transition calculated as the melting temperature (Tm).",

XTT was graciously supplied by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute. CEM-SS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media without phenol red and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mM L-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (BioWhittaker) (complete medium). Exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in complete medium, and a 50 \u03bcl aliquot containing 5 \u00d7 10 3 cells was added to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate containing serial dilutions of GRFT, mGRFT or the mGRFT tandemers (2mGRFT, 2mGRFT3, 3mGRFT, 4mGRFT) in a volume of 100 \u03bcl of medium. Stock supernatants of HIV-1 RF were diluted in complete medium to yield sufficient cytopathicity (80-90% cell kill in 6 days), and a 50 \u03bcl aliquot was added to appropriate wells. Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0C and then stained for cellular viability using XTT. All experiments were performed in triplicate. To assess activity EC 50 values were determined by calculating the point at which the dose-response sigmoid curve of increasing cell-survival crossed the point at which 50% of the cells survived. Compound-induced direct cytotoxicity to CEM-SS cells was tested simultaneously by adding identical concentrations of test compounds to wells containing only CEM-SS cells and no virus. Cell viability in these wells was measured at the same time point and by the same methodology as employed for wells used to evaluate the protection against-HIV-1-induced cytopathicity.",

In a typical experiment with the mGRFT tandemers and monomeric, glycosylated, bacculovirus-produced HIV-1 IIIB gp120 (Immunodiagnostics, Inc., Woburn, MA), the mGRFT tandemer protein (180 \u03bcM) was placed in the syringe injector and the gp120 was placed in the calorimeter cell (2.5 \u03bcM). In all experiments, a total of 55 injections of tandemer (5 \u03bcl/injection) were made, with 600 s spacing between injections. The titrations were all done in a rapidly stirring solution (300 rpm) held at a constant temperature of 30\u00b0C. The heats of binding were recorded as the excess power compensation required for maintaining the same temperature during the course of the titration. Baseline experiments of tandemer titration into buffer were done to calculate heats of dilution and this value was subtracted from the experimental heats of binding. The resulting isotherms were fitted using Origin 5.0 nonlinear least-squares program according to manufacturer's protocol, and the values for the enthalpy of binding (\u0394H) and the dissociation constant were obtained. From the dissociation constant, a value for the free energy of binding (\u0394G) was extrapolated (\u0394G = \u2212RTlnKa), and from this value, the entropy of binding (\u0394S) was lastly calculated (\u0394G = \u0394H -T\u0394S).",

Autocorrelation measurements were carried out at 25\u00b0C using a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA) that provided particle size distributions, the peak of which was taken to be the mean particle size. For dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments, the viruses were pre-mixed with lectin at the same concentrations used in cryo-electron microscopy experiments. This ensured a valid comparison between dynamic light scattering experiments, and the imaging experiments in which there was no sample dilution before mixing.
