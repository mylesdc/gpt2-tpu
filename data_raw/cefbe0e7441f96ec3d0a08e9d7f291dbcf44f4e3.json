However, the effect of IFN-\u03b1 on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-\u03b1 on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-\u03b1 markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-\u03b1 treatment. In addition, caspase 4-which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis-was activated in response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-\u03b1 might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-\u03b1 may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.",

IFN-\u03b1 exerts its anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, and/or suppressing oncogene expression [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . IFN-\u03b1 has been increasingly used in clinics to treat a wide range of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer (RCC) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, IFN-\u03b1 has been barely used in the treatment of cervical cancer either alone or in combination with other agents. Although cervical cancer is the leading threat to women's health worldwide, there is no cure to this disease at present [15, 16] . Therefore, finding a novel and effective treatment for this disease is highly demanded and should be the direction of scientist's efforts.",

Cell apoptotic signals can be generated from and transmitted through different cellular compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or the death receptors on cell surfaces [21, 22] . Although induced by different means, apoptosis is primarily executed by a family of proteases known as the caspases (cysteinyl, aspartate-specific proteases), and among them the activation of caspase 3 is the hallmark of apoptosis. The apoptotic signal may target the outer membrane of mitochondria to increase membrane permeability, which in turn promotes the release of cytochrome c [22] . The apoptotic signal may be generated from the ER by various stresses in a caspase 4 dependent and independent manner. In addition, the membrane proximity-induced activations of caspases 8 and 10 release the respective cleaved caspase molecules within the cytoplasm [23] [24] [25] [26] . Subsequently, the three pathways stimulate the common effectors (caspases 3, 6, and 7) to ultimately execute cell apoptosis.",

To test this possibility, HeLa cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h and subjected to annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed a marked increase in the population of Annexin V+/PI\u2212 cells in response to a higher dose of IFN-\u03b1 delivery (Figure 2A ), indicating that early apoptosis is induced upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Statistical analysis showed that a higher dose delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly increased the population of apoptotic cells ( Figure 2B ). To further define the optimal dose of IFN-\u03b1, HeLa cells were treated with six increasing doses (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h. Figure 2C shows that dose-dependent apoptosis was induced as the IFN-\u03b1 concentration increased from 0 to 50 ng/mL. The result also indicates that IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis reaches a platform when the delivered dose of IFN-\u03b1 is more than 50 ng/mL. To further confirm this result, whole-cell lysates were prepared from these IFN-\u03b1-treated cells (depicted in Figure 2C ) and probed with anti-caspase 3 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies, then subjected to Western blot analysis. Figure 2D demonstrates that the increased delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced the pre-caspase3 expressions and markedly increased the cleaved caspase 3 expressions, indicating that IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis indeed reaches a platform after 50 ng/mL. Based on the above information, we chose the concentration 100 ng/mL as the optimal dose for IFN-\u03b1 treatment in the experiments afterwards.

To address this question directly, cell lysates prepared from IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells were probed with anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-caspase 3, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), and anti-cleaved-PARP1 antibodies. Bcl-xL belongs to the BCL2 family and exerts its anti-apoptotic function by preventing the oligomerization of Bax/Bak proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the other member of BCL2 family, Bim, has the opposite effect by promoting cell apoptosis [28] . Oligomeric Bax/Bak proteins that are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane can cause alterations of membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c, which eventually activates caspase 3 for executing cell apoptosis [29] . Indeed, IFN-\u03b1 treatment was observed to markedly enhance the expression level of Bim protein, dramatically inhibit the protein expression of Bcl-xL, and significantly activate caspase 3 expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3A ). In addition, a slight increase in the production of the cleaved PARP1 was also detected as the doses of IFN-\u03b1 increased ( Figure 3A ). Figure 3B shows that the expression levels of cytochrome c in whole-cell lysates were markedly increased, comparable to the dose-dependent activation of caspase 3, indicating that cytochrome c might be released into cytoplasm from mitochondrion upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment. To further confirm this result, both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions of the IFN-\u03b1 treated HeLa cells were separated using a mitochondria isolation kit. Figure 3B further demonstrates that the expression level of cytochrome c in mitochondria was significantly decreased as the delivered dose of IFN-\u03b1 increased, while that in the cytoplasm was the opposite.

To test whether or not the caspase 4-related ER-stress pathway contributes to IFN-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either control or siCasp 4 along with increasing doses (0, 10, 100 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1.

We showed that IFN-\u03b1 treatment on HeLa cells not only results in the decrease of glucose consumption and lactate production, but also causes the activation of apoptotic promoting protein Bim and the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL ( Figure 3A ). Our results first demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1 treatment promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway can be activated by IFN-\u03b1. Yang et al. first showed that IFN-\u03b1 was able to stimulate the cleavage of caspase 4 in HeLa cells [20] . Our results confirm their observation, and further show that IFN-\u03b1-mediated caspase 4 cleavage contributes to the IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. However, IFN-\u03b1 treatment fails to activate caspase 8 and 10-the important initiators for extrinsic apoptosis-in HeLa cells, indicating that the IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis may be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our data demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1-mediated HeLa cell apoptosis may involve both of the intrinsic and caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways, however, how these two pathways regulate IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis needs to be further explored.",
