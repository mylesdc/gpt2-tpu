After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein. Recent reports of infection enhancement by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest anti-prM responses could be potentially harmful. Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown.",

E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride.",

While most DENV infections are asymptomatic or result in a selflimited disease, known as dengue fever, some may develop severe and potentially life-threatening disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Despite numerous efforts to develop therapeutic or prophylactic interventions, there is no licensed antiviral or DENV vaccine currently available [1] [2] [3] . DENV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 10.6 kb. Flanked by the 59 and 39 untranslated regions, the single open reading frame encodes a polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved by cellular and viral protease into three structural proteins, capsid, precursor membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins [4] .",

The prM protein has been shown to serve as a chaperon of E protein [28, 29] and to prevent E protein from premature fusion within acidic compartments along the secretary pathway [30, 31] . While a previous study reported a protective role of anti-prM antibodies against DENV infection in mice [32] , recent studies showed that anti-prM mAbs neutralize DENV poorly and potently enhanced the infection of immature DENV particles by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [33] [34] [35] , suggesting anti-prM responses should be minimized in dengue vaccines [35] . Due to the inefficient cleavage of prM protein on DENV virions [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , the presence of prM protein in DENV vaccine preparation (live attenuated or killed virus vaccine) could represent enhancing epitopes and be potentially harmful [35] .

Considering the effect of ADE mediated by anti-prM antibodies, this finding suggests that E protein ectodomain could be a potential subunit immunogen that preserves the conformation of E protein without inducing anti-prM response. The expression and characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. We found that E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, the ectodomain of E protein can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride.",

A control gradient of protein markers with known molecular weight was also performed as calibrations [43] . As shown in Figure 2A , the majority of E protein expressed by prME construct was found in the low-density fractions (fractions 6 to 8), which co-sedimented with the peak of prM protein (fractions 7 and 8), suggesting the formation of prM-E heterodimer. In contrast, the peak of prM protein (fractions 4 and 5) expressed by prMEd395 did not cosediment with that of E protein ectodomain, which had two peaks (fractions 6 to 8 and fractions 12 to 13). Interestingly, E protein ectodomain expressed by Ed395 displayed a pattern similar to that of prMEd395, whereas E protein alone was found predominately in high density fractions (fractions 11 to 13). Comparing with the control gradient of protein markers, fractions 6 to 8 correspond to monomer and fractions 11 to 13 corresponds to tetramer or higher order complexes. Taken together, these findings suggest that in the absence of prM protein, E protein or E protein ectodomain alone can form large complexes, most likely E-E dimer or higher order complexes in high density fractions.",

In agreement with our previous report [38] , E protein expressed by prME construct was found in both the membrane fraction and pellets of soluble fraction, which contain VLPs [25, 38] , suggesting that significant amounts of VLPs were produced and present in the lumen of ER or other compartments ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, E protein expressed by E, prMEd395 or Ed395 was found predominantly in the membrane fraction with a relatively small amount in the pellets of soluble fraction, suggesting the importance of stem/ transmembrane domains and prM-E interaction for efficient production of VLPs in the lumen of intracellular compartments ( Figure 3B ). As a control, calnexin, an integral ER membrane protein, was detected in the membrane fraction but not in the soluble fraction. To study the intracellular localization of E protein, we analyzed the glycosylation pattern by endo H and PNGase F digestion. In both membrane and soluble fractions, E protein expressed by prME and E constructs was sensitive to endo H ( Figures. 3C and 3D) , suggesting that it contains high mannose glycans and retains in a compartment prior to trans-Golgi, most likely ER. In contrast, E protein ectodomain expressed by prMEd395 and Ed395 constructs was resistant to endo H, suggesting that it contains complex glycans that are completely processed in trans-Golgi ( Figures. 3C and 2D) . Taken together, these findings suggest that E protein ectodomain associates with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi probably due to the lack of the stem/transmembrane domains, which contain an ER retention signal as reported previously [47] . 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395, E or Ed395 were treated with Triton X-100; cell lysates and protein markers were subjected to 5 to 20% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.

As shown in Figure 4C , in the absence of Triton X-100 pellets derived from 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395 or Ed395 sedimented as a discrete population (fractions 4 to 6) with a density of 1.13-1.15 g/cm 3 ( Figure S2 ), which is similar to that of flaviviral VLPs reported previously [48] . On the contrary, in the presence of Trion X-100 pellets derived from these three transfectants were solubilized and migrated to top fractions, suggesting that the pellets were in particulate form containing membrane rather than protein aggregates ( Figure 4C ). Further examination by EM revealed VLPs in the pellets derived from the three constructs ( Figure 4D ). Recently, cytoskeletondriven mechanism has been shown to be involved in the budding of several RNA viruses [49] [50] [51] . To investigate whether cytoskeleton is involved in the formation of VLPs, we tested the incorporation of a cytoskeleton protein, b-actin, into VLPs. As shown in Figure 4E , b-actin but not b-tubulin (data not shown) was incorporated into the VLPs of Ed395, whereas neither was incorporated into the VLPs of prME or prMEd395. These findings suggest that b-actin is involved in the formation of VLPs derived from Ed395.",

These two mutations also reduced the secretion of VLPs [54] . To examine whether N-linked glycosylation affects the secretion of E protein ectodomain, site-direct mutagenesis was carried out to replace each of the two threonines (residues 69 and 155) at the third position of N-glycosylation sites with an alanine or valine in the Ed395 construct. Substitution introduced to residue at the third rather than first position of N-glycosylation site was employed, because previous study involving substitutions of residues at first (asparagine, residues 67 and 153) and third positions suggested the asparagine residue rather than N-linked glycan alone also affects assembly/release and infectivity of DENV in vitro [55] . Consistent with the loss of N-linked glycan, all 4 mutant E proteins migrated faster than the WT glycosylated E protein ectodomain ( Figure 6A ); the amount of E protein ectodomain expressed by the 4 mutants in cell lysates was comparable to that by WT Ed395 construct, suggesting that substitutions of alanine or valine do not affect the expression of E protein ectodomain. In contrast, the amount of mutant E protein ectodomain in supernatants compared to that of WT was slightly or moderately reduced ( Figures 6A and 6C ). After treating with ammonia chloride, which can increase the pH of the endosomal compartment, the amount of WT E protein ectodomain in supernatants decreased slightly, probably due to the effect of ammonia chloride on secretion. Interestingly, the amount of mutant E protein ectodomain in supernatants increased compared to that of WT ( Figures 6B and 6D ). Taken together, these findings suggest that alanine or valine substitution introduced to either threonine residue at the third position of two N-glycosylation sites reduce the secretion of E protein ectodomain, which can be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride.",

In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain expresses well. Subcellular fractionation and enzyme digestion experiments revealed that E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in a compartment beyond trans-Golgi, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles, average 49 nm in diameter, based on sucrose gradient analysis and EM examination with immunogold labeling. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that E protein ectodomain alone can form particles. Furthermore, mutational analysis showed that removal of either N-linked glycosylation at residue 67 or 153 reduced the secretion of E protein ectodomain, which can be restored by ammonia chloride treatment. These findings suggest that N-linked glycan affects the secretion of E protein ectodomain. Flaviviral E protein, a type I membrane protein, has been shown to associate with membrane in the cells, most likely through its two transmembrane domains and the stem region partially buried in membrane [38, 45] . Our findings that E protein ectodomain expressed by prMEd395 or Ed395, both lacking the stem and transmembrane domains, associated with membrane was unexpected. A crystallographic study of recombinant prM-E proteins complex revealed the heterodimeric interaction between the N-terminus of prM protein (mainly pr peptide) and E protein ectodomain at high resolution [56] . It is possible that E protein ectodomain expressed by prMEd395 interacts with N-terminus of prM protein (with two transmembrane domains), which contributes to the membrane association. Recent cryo-EM studies of mature DENV2 virions and mature and immature DENV1 virions at high resolution revealed that the N-terminus of M described in Methods.

In agreement with this, we run a similar 5-20% sucrose gradient and found two populations of VLPs (average 32.3 nm and 47.6 nm in diameter) expressed by DENV4 prME construct. In the study of TBEV VLPs, small VLPs were mainly found in WT prME construct (which generally cleaves prM efficiently), whereas both large and small VLPs were found in prM cleavage-deficient mutant, suggesting that the extent of prM cleavage may affect the size of VLPs [41] . Analysis of the recognition of large immature, small immature, large mature and small mature VLPs by 18 anti-E mAbs revealed that the maturation status rather than the size affected the antigenicity [41] . Since the prM cleavage of DENV has been shown to be inefficient [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , this may account for the almost equal proportion of large and small VLPs expressed by our DENV4 prME construct. Whether the size of DENV VLPs affects the recognition by different anti-E mAbs remains to be investigated.",

The presence of b-actin in the VLPs formed by Ed395 but not in the VLPs formed by WT prME construct, the relative homogeneity in size (average 49.0 nm in diameter) compared with the large and small VLPs formed by prME construct, and the intracellular localization of E protein ectodomain in a compartment beyond tran-Golgi compared with WT prM/E proteins in ER suggest that a different mechanism probably involving cytoskeleton-driven force to produce VLPs by Ed395.

These two mutations reduced the secretion of DENV2 VLPs; similarly mutations introduced to the N-linked glycosylation site at residue154 (the only N-linked glycosylation site) of E protein of linage I WNV and TBEV have also been shown to reduce the secretion of VLPs [48, 59] . Although altered interaction between E protein and chaperons in ER by removal of N-linked glycan at residue 67 and protein folding have been suggested to account for the impairment in secretion of DENV2 and VLPs [54] , the mechanism remains unknown. Structural analysis of DENV E protein ectodomain dimer revealed that the N-linked glycan at residue 153 covers the fusion loop of domain II and two N-linked glycans can stabilize E-E dimer [22, 23] . Mutant DENV2, DENV3 and WNV with loss of N-linked glycan at residue 153 (or its equivalent) were found to fuse with target membrane at elevated pH or have lower stability at mildly acidic pH [6, 60, 61] . In this regard, our findings that reduced secretion of E protein ectodomain by removal of N-linked glycosylation at residue 67 or 153 could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride suggest N-linked glycosylation at residue 67 or 153 of E protein ectodomain may help passing through acidic environment in the secretary pathway by stabilizing the E-E dimmer or preventing premature fusion with endosomal membrane.",

We also tested the conformation of secreted E protein ectodomain from different sources by a capture ELISA assay using 9 human mAbs with different epitopes/binding domains (Table S1) [36, 62] . Secreted E protein ectodomains prepared from 293T cells in the presence (prMEd395) or absence (Ed395) of prM protein or from Drodophila Schneicher 2 (S2) cells (recombinant E) [63] can be recognized similarly well by all 9 human mAbs tested ( Figure S4B ), suggesting that lacking prM protein does not affect the overall conformation of E protein ectodomain and that secreted E protein ectodomains derived form mammalian cells and insect cells preserve the epitopes recognized by all mouse and human mAbs tested. These findings are in agreement with our previous report [36] and suggest that the E protein ectodomain may be an ideal immunogen of subunit dengue vaccine, mimicking the native conformation of E protein without inducing anti-prM responses. To extend these observations, future studies to construct Ed395 of other serotypes and characterize their properties are needed. In addition, developing methods or optimizing conditions such as lowering the temperature to improve the biogenesis of Ed395 VLPs is warranted [64] . Moreover, studies to evaluate the immunogenicity including neutralizing antibodies induced by secreted Ed395 in animal models is critical for demonstrating Ed395 as a potential vaccine design. In this regard, it is worth noting that recombinant soluble E protein (corresponding to our Ed395) produced in Drosophila S2 cells can elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice and monkeys [63] . A recent study reported that Venezuelan encephalitis virus replicon particles expressing soluble E protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and provide protection in monkeys [65] . It is likely that soluble E protein and its VLPs produced by Ed395 construct may induce stronger immune responses than soluble E protein alone.
