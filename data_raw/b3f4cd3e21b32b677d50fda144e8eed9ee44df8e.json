Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes diarrhea in piglets with an age-dependent decrease of severity. Results: We used 60 weaned piglets that were divided into three groups to evaluate the effect of different Zn levels added to a conventional diet (50 mg Zn/kg diet, Zn low , control group). The other groups received the diet supplemented with ZnO at final concentrations of 150 mg Zn/kg diet (Zn med ), or 2,500 mg/kg diet (Zn high ). Oral challenge infection with TGEV was performed when the pigs had been fed for 1 week with the respective diet. Half of the piglets of each group were sacrificed at day 1 and 18 after challenge infection. Fecal consistency was improved and body weights increased in the Zn high group when compared to the other groups, but no direct effect of Zn concentrations in the diet on fecal TGEV shedding and mucosal immune responses was detectable. However, in the Zn high group, we found a prevention of villus atrophy and decreased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of jejunal epithelium. Furthermore, pigs receiving high Zn diet showed a down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), Zn transporter SLC39A4 (ZIP4), but up-regulation of metallothionein-1 (MT1), as well as the Zn transporters SLC30A1 (ZnT1) and SLC30A5 (ZnT5). In addition, forskolin-induced chloride secretion and epithelial resistance were controlled at a physiological level in the Zn high but not the other groups. Finally, in the Zn high group, we documented an earlier and higher systemic TGEV-specific serum antibody response.",

Many potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain the potential beneficial effect of Zn against virus infections. For example, Zn mediates antiviral effects through the inhibition of nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases or other proteins essential for the different phases of the viral life cycle [5, 6] . In addition, Zn participates in initiating and maintaining robust immune responses, in particular cytokine production and modulation of the activity of immune cells [7] . Zn induces the production of innate interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and also immune IFN-\u03b3, and can potentiate the antiviral action of IFN-\u03b1, but not of IFN-\u03b3 [8] . Clearance of viral infections requires cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are also highly dependent on the presence of Zn [7] . Antibody production during both the first and an immunological memory response is disturbed by Zn deficiency [9, 10] , indicating that Zn is necessary for optimal results following vaccination.",

Diarrhea is caused by impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function, which most likely leads to malnutrition and decreased uptake of micronutrients, including Zn. It was shown that oral Zn supplementation with high doses was able to counteract this loss, improve intestinal mucosal integrity as well as absorption of water and electrolytes [12, 14] . Furthermore, it leads to a faster regeneration of the gut epithelium [15] . However, because of environmental concerns, the maximum level of Zn allowed in pig diets was set up to 150 ppm in the European Union, irrespective of the Zn formulation [16] .",

Piglets from the Zn low group showed a destruction of the architecture of intestinal tissue with villous atrophy, which resulted in a significant reduction of the intestinal surface area by a factor of 1.38 (n = 6, P = 0.009) compared to the Zn med group where no villus atrophy was observed (n = 6) ( Figure 4A and B). No further changes in villus morphology in the Zn high group (n = 6) could be detected ( Figure 4A and B). In piglets from the Zn low group, the majority of jejunal enterocytes was caspase-3positive while being morphologically altered, whereas in Zn med jejunal tissue the number of caspase-3-positive cells were drastically reduced and there was a further reduction of apoptotic cells in Zn high animals ( Figure 5A and B).

Furthermore, in our study the piglets were provided with a relatively comfortable environment to minimize stress other than that induced by infection. It should be stressed that our experimental conditions vary substantially from those in commercial farming conditions. This could also contribute to the absence of severe clinical signs after infection. However, this study demonstrated that feeding the Zn high diet improved the fecal score and led to higher body weights after infection in comparison to the Zn med and Zn low groups. Several studies demonstrated that feeding high levels of Zn reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea and improved fecal consistency [26, 27] . Our results are consistent with these findings showing that the Zn high group had higher fecal scores compared to the Zn med and Zn low groups after infection. There was also a direct correlation between Zn levels and histological changes. TGEV infection in the Zn low group led to destruction of the enterocytes of jejunal villi as reflected by marked villus atrophy. It has been reported that Zn plays a fundamental role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and function. For example, supplementation of Zn reduced methotrexate-induced intestinal damage and resulted in faster recovery [28] , while it reduced intestinal permeability in Bangladeshi children with acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea syndrome [29] . Furthermore, feeding supplemental Zn to rats with experimental colitis improved mucosal repair by regulating tight junction permeability [30] . In agreement with these data, higher R epi, corr values in the Zn med and Zn high group indicate that Zn may prevent epithelial barrier loss induced by TGEV. The dramatic increase in \u0394I SC FSK, corr observed in the Zn low group despite the reduced surface area may be interpreted as a protective mechanism. Chloride secretion is the basis of secretory diarrhea and might be regarded as a mechanism to rapidly extrude pathogens. The increase in \u0394I SC Glc, corr observed in some of the animals from the Zn low group may be a compensatory effect and is in agreement with the observation that, even in the Zn low group, animals gained weight at a normal rate. This considerably larger variance in the Zn low group indicates that some animals were able to compensate reduced glucose uptake due to the loss of villi by increasing glucose transport capacity.",

In agreement with such finding, TGEV-specific serum antibody titers were detected earlier and at higher levels in Zn high when compared to Zn low piglets. This finding may be the result of multiple effects of Zn on antigen-presenting cells, T-cells and antibody-producing B-lymphocytes. IgA is the primary immunoglobulin isotype induced at the mucosal surface. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucosal secretions provides protection against bacterial and viral pathogens and neutralizes microbial toxins [32] . Zn can influence sIgA levels by altering the cytokine profile of stimulated immune cells residing in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) [33] . Furthermore, sIgA responses are mediated through activated Th2 cells producing, among other, abundant amount of IL-6 [34] . In this study, there was an increased sIgA levels from 1 to 18 dpi, indicating that adaptive mucosal immune responses were induced by TGEV infection but not influenced by the diet. This finding is in accordance with results from Broom and colleagues [33] , who also showed only slight differences of intestinal IgA concentrations between animals either receiving low or high levels of dietary ZnO. In accordance with these findings, the expression of IL-6 in the intestinal tissues also showed no difference between the dietary groups at 1 dpi. Therefore, it is questionable if Zn plays a role in enhancing intestinal IgA concentration.",

At 1 dpi, higher IFN-\u03b1 gene expression levels in the Zn low group may be consistent with a more severe TGEV infection or higher virus loads in this group compared to the Zn high group. The activation of OAS, one of the IFN-stimulated gene products (ISGs), can lead to apoptosis [37] , potentially by indirectly triggering cleavage of caspase-3 [38] . The increased OAS level in the Zn low group may reflect TGEV-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial, as it was shown, that the amount of caspase-3-positive cells was markedly increased in the Zn low compared with the Zn med and Zn high group. This finding is in agreement with the histological observations: the high-grade villus atrophy in the Zn low and normal jejunal mucosal morphology in the Zn high group.",

As reported previously, this indicates an outbalanced Zn homeostasis although the expression of Zn transporters in the jejunum was regulated to reduce Zn uptake (ZIP4) from the gut lumen and increase the export of Zn from epithelial cells (ZnT1, ZnT5) in the Zn high group. However, an increased level of Zn in intestinal tissue and the induction of metallothionein may explain our observations of improved intestinal mucosal integrity and histological changes, which are in line with other studies [12, 14] . Thus, changes in absorption of water and electrolytes may counteract TGEV infection, which causes impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and decreased uptake of micronutrients.",

During infection, TNF-\u03b1 is a mediator between the immune system and the intestinal epithelial barrier by altering tight junction proteins and their cellular localization. More specifically, the cytokine up-regulates the poreforming protein claudin-2 [40] and redistributes the tightening protein claudin-1 [41] . This leads to an impaired barrier function which is associated with increased paracellular permeability. However, our in vitro work [25] and the in vivo study presented here did not find any up-or down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 after TGEV infection in any of the experimental groups. The outcome is, however, in accordance with the data set of permeability to fluorescein (P FLU corr ), as paracellular permeability was not affected. The data could, therefore, be interpreted as a result of a different pathological mechanism, possibly mediated by IFN-\u03b1, rather than by TNF-\u03b1, as up-regulation of the former in Zn low piglets was clearly evident.",

The Zn low diet represents the regular feed of the animals and the Zn low group, therefore, represented the control group for this experiment. At 26 days of age, animals were moved to a containment facility (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung, Berlin, Germany) where they were randomly allocated to 6 pens per group. The piglets were fed the respective diet ad libitum in a pelleted form, water was also provided ad libitum by nipple drinkers. The pens were of equal size (2.8 m 2 ), equipped with a feeding automate with 5 feeding places and a nipple drinker. The floors were covered with rubber mate and a red light lamp was placed above to provide additional heat. Room temperature was kept at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with humidity of 50 -60% and constant air volume exchange. The pens were thoroughly cleaned by brushing the floors and walls with consecutive flushing with lukewarm water in the mornings. Superficial flushing of the floors was additionally performed in the late afternoon. At day 28 of age, all piglets were challenged orally with 2 mL TGEV with a titer of 1.0E+07 PFU/mL.
