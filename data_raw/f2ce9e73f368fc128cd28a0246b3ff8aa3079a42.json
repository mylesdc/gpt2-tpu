The VE calculated in this way is here designated as VE(influenza) (Table A1 and Figure 3 ). Table A1 lists the overall attack rates (AR) for ILI in vaccinated and non-vaccinated participants in 2014-15 and 2015-16, alongside with the estimated relative risk (RR) and vaccine efficacy (VE), for all participants overall, and stratified according to the presence vs. absence of chronic conditions and/or older age. The AR for a given period was calculated as the total number of new ILI cases in each group of participants divided by the mean number of weekly active participants in that group, during that period. The relative risk (RR) was calculated dividing the AR in vaccinated by the AR in non-vaccinated participants. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) was determined as the relative risk reduction in vaccinated participants (i.e., VE=[1-RR]x100). The 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the LaMorte Biostatistics tool. ",
