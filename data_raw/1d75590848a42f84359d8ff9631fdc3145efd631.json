            "text": "The eIF4F complex is a translation initiation factor that closely regulates translation in response to a multitude of environmental conditions including viral infection. How translation initiation factors regulate rotavirus infection remains poorly understood. In this study, the knockdown of the components of the eIF4F complex using shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were performed, respectively. We have demonstrated that loss-of-function of the three components of eIF4F, including eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G, remarkably promotes the levels of rotavirus genomic RNA and viral protein VP4. Consistently, knockdown of the negative regulator of eIF4F and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) inhibits the expression of viral mRNA and the VP4 protein. Mechanically, we confirmed that the silence of the eIF4F complex suppressed the protein level of IRF1 and IRF7 that exert potent antiviral effects against rotavirus infection. Thus, these results demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is an essential host factor restricting rotavirus replication, revealing new targets for the development of new antiviral strategies against rotavirus infection.",

Among the structural proteins, as a spike protein, rotavirus VP4 plays an essential role in both viral entry and exit [7] . VP4 was also demonstrated to be of importance in viral attachment and internalization [8] , which is often used for the development of rotavirus vaccines [8] . VP4 contains two subunits including a C-terminal subunit VP5* and a N-terminal subunit VP8*, and both VP5* and VP8* help virus entry by interacting with several putative partners and cell surface receptors [7] . The rotavirus genome is a double-strand RNA containing a cap at 5 untranslated regions (UTR) synthesized by the viral transcriptase but lacks a polyadenylated tail instead having a consensus sequence at 3 UTR [9] . It has been reported that rotavirus NSP3 is able to bind to the 3 consensus sequence of viral mRNA and interact with eIF4G to aid translation of viral mRNA [10] . Rotavirus NSP3 stabilizes the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction to exert an enhanced effect on the translation of both poly (A)-and non-poly (A)-tailed mRNAs [11] .",

            "text": "There are three phases in protein synthesis including initiation, elongation, and termination [11] . Initiation determines translation rates [12] . Most of the eukaryotic mRNAs are characterized by a m7GpppX structure (where m7Gppp is the 7-methyl-guanosine-containing and X is any nucleotide), termed as a cap, at the 5 ends and the poly (A) tail at the 3 end [13] . The mRNA containing a cap at the 5 ends is able to be more efficiently translated than that lacking this structure [14] , and these mRNAs are translated in a cap-dependent manner [12] . The cap structure is bound by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) which is a protein complex containing three constituent proteins: a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) [15] . The eIF4F complex plays a pivotal role in cap-dependent mRNA protein translation initiated by recruiting mRNA to a ribosome [13] . As an RNA helicase, eIF4A makes use of ATP hydrolysis to unwind and resolve the RNA secondary structure [16] . The eIF4E recognizes and binds to the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap located at the 5 -UTRs of mRNA to mediate the mRNA recruitment on ribosomes, thus initiating the translation together with other initiation factors [17] . As a scaffold protein, eIF4G plays a central role in translation initiation by assembling eIF4E and eIF4A to further form the eIF4F complex [18] . The programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) is a translation suppressor of mRNAs by interacting with eIF4A to suppress its helicase activity [19] . As a downstream target of mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the phosphorylation of protein kinase S6K1 is able to phosphorylate PDCD4 to release it from eIF4A, thus allowing eIF4A to interact with eIF4G to form the eIF4F complex, followed by initiating translation [20] .",

Viral protein synthesis completely relies on the translational machinery of the host due to viruses lacking this machinery themselves [21] . Viruses are able to exploit the translational machinery, including eIF4F, to support the translation of their transcripts [15] . Certain mammalian viruses are involved in targeting the eIF4F complex to regulate both viral and host mRNA translation; while many RNA viruses inhibit host protein synthesis to initiate the translation of their own mRNAs by inhibiting eIF4F [22] . Feline calicivirus (FCV) and mouse norovirus (MNV) have been reported to be capable of directly interacting with eIF4E, and viral RNA translation requires the eIF4A, indicating that the replication of the two viruses requires eIF4F [23] . Blocking eIF4E-eIF4G interaction has been demonstrated to cause inhibition of coronavirus replication, indicating that eIF4F has a promoting effect on the virus replication [24] . Furthermore, certain members of the eIF4G family were thought to be able restrict the infection of Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) [25] . Thus, the eIF4F complex has different effects on distinct viruses.",

Although rotavirus infection did not affect the protein expression of the eIF4F complex (Supplementary Figure  S1 ), it is interesting to investigate whether the components of the eIF4F complex regulate the course of the rotavirus infection. To this aim, we first detected the effects of eIF4A on rotavirus infection, by performing a lentiviral RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assay to silence the eIF4A gene. All five short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors showed successful knockdown ( Figure 1A ,B). Importantly, two shRNA vectors (No 1 and 2) resulted in a 121.7 \u00b1 60.6 (n = 6, P < 0.01)-and 56.7 \u00b1 29.9 (n = 6, P < 0.01)fold increase in SA11 rotavirus mRNA, respectively ( Figure 1C ). All shRNA vectors showed no clear cytotoxicity determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Supplementary Figure S2A ). Western blot indicated that all five shRNA vectors increased the rotavirus VP4 protein level ( Figure 1D ). To further verify these findings, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the eIF4A gene in Caco2 cells ( Figure 1E ). After eIF4A knockout, the viral mRNA and protein levels were remarkably reduced ( Figure 1F ,G). ",

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication was demonstrated to increase the overall abundance of the eIF4F components and promote assembly of the eIF4F complexes [32] .

            "text": "The eIF4F is a tripartite complex composed of three components including a cap-binding subunit (eIF4E), an RNA helicase (eIF4A), and a large molecular scaffold (eIF4G) that is associated with eIF3-bound 40S ribosome subunits [30] . These three components of the eIF4F complex were reported to closely regulate the life cycle of various viruses either promoting or restricting the infection. By treating influenza virus infected cells with Hippuristanol, a sterol, which is able to suppress RNA binding, ATPase, and helicase activities to block eIF4A-dependent translation, which demonstrated that eIF4A fully determines the translation of influenza virus mRNAs [34] ; however, eIF4E does not affect influenza virus protein synthesis [29] . Hepatitis E virus (HEV) requires all three components of eIF4F to replicate in the host [35] . The protein synthesis of Junin virus (JUNV), Tacaribe virus (TCRV), and Pichinde virus (PICV) requires the participation of eIF4A and eIF4G but not eIF4E [36] . The eIF4F complex is required for maintaining translation efficiency of HCMV at the start of infection; while viral protein synthesis becomes increasingly insensitive to inhibition of eIF4F complex at late stage of virus infection [37] . Cencic et al. demonstrated that blocking the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G by a small molecule was capable of remarkably suppressing corovarius replication [24] . Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, and its NSP3 is capable of binding to eIF4G to stabilize the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction [10] . However, knockdown of NSP3 did not influence the synthesis of viral proteins, indicating that it is not involved in viral mRNA translation and virus replication [38] . We have previously confirmed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway sustains rotavirus infection via its downstream effector 4E-BP1 [39] , which provokes us to further investigate the effect of eIF4E on rotavirus infection, since mTOR exerts the function of splitting the 4E-BP1-eIF4E dimer via phosphorylating 4E-BP1 [40] . Unexpectedly, we found that blocking the three components of the eIF4F complex promotes rotavirus infection ( Figure 1, Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Figure 4 ). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of eIF4F on rotavirus might be via another scenario other than the regulating of the capping process of viral mRNA. PDCD4 is capable of directly inhibiting the helicase activity of eIF4A by competing its binding to eIF4G to suppress the activity of the eIF4F complex [41] . Consistently, we found that blocking PDCD4 was capable of inhibiting rotavirus infection ( Figure 5 ), which is in agreement with the effect of the eIF4F complex on rotavirus infection. Herein, our findings suggest that the eIF4F complex exerts inhibitory effects on rotavirus infection.",

            "text": "Mounting evidence reveals that the eIF4F complex perverts the interferon signaling pathway that exerts a pivotal role in defensing various viruses. Viruses often trigger a cascade of events to activate certain transcription factors, such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, after being recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors), which eventually enhances interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) to exert antiviral effects [27] . It was confirmed that the dephosphorylation of eIF4E was able to stimulate the NF-\u03baB pathway to promote the production of type I interferon [27] . The eIF4F complex was demonstrated to closely regulate the translation of STAT1 mRNA [28] . In 4E-BP1 \u2212/\u2212 and 4E-BP2 \u2212/\u2212 double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), it was found that type-I IFN was strongly promoted through enhancing the expression of IRF7 mRNA [26] . The binding of eIF4E to eIF4G may be involved in the translation of IRF7 mRNA [42] . Consistently, we demonstrated that knockdown and knockout of eIF4E and eIF4G were capable of suppressing the protein level of IRF1 and IRF7 ( Figure 6 ). Importantly, we confirmed that IRF1 and IRF7 per se were able to significantly inhibit rotavirus replication ( Figure 6 ). Thus, we have provided a possible novel insight into how the eIF4F complex regulates rotavirus replication.",
