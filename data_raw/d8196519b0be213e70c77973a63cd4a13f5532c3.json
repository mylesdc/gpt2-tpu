A description of the Jos outbreak is presented below, while the full networks of contacts of 23 and 11 patients for the two respective outbreaks are presented in Figures 1.A and 1 .B in the main text. For the Jos oubreak, TS is the index case, however other contacts are possible, for example case RA is a member of hospital sta\u21b5. It is likely that this person was a source of exposure to other people working in the hospital, (e.g. the nurse MA and the cleaner AA) or spending a long time in the same ward (e.g. case FT, who was admitted to the ward for chronic renal disease). Extra hospital infections were plausible through case FT.",

The most striking feature of the Jos outbreak is the apparent transmission of Lassa infection from one person to possibly 16 others exposed to her in the hospital ward.
