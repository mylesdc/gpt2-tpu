            "text": "Background: The envelope glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can efficiently pseudotype lentiviral vectors. Some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and subsequently fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low \u03b1-DG affinity utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. We pseudotyped non-primate feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors using LCMV derived glycoproteins with high or low affinity to \u03b1-DG and evaluated their properties in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We pseudotyped FIV with the LCMV WE54 strain envelope glycoprotein and also engineered a point mutation in the WE54 envelope glycoprotein (L260F) to diminish \u03b1-DG affinity and direct binding to alternate receptors. We hypothesized that this change would alter in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer to neonatal animals. Results: In mice, hepatic \u03b1and \u03b2-DG expression was greatest at the late gestational and neonatal time points. When displayed on the surface of the FIV lentivirus the WE54 L260F mutant glycoprotein bound weakly to immobilized \u03b1-DG. Additionally, LCMV WE54 pseudotyped FIV vector transduction was neutralized by preincubation with soluble \u03b1-DG, while the mutant glycoprotein pseudotyped vector was not. In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and \u03b2-galactosidase staining. Conclusions: These results suggest that a developmentally regulated receptor for LCMV is expressed abundantly in neonatal mice. LCMV pseudotyped vectors may have applications for neonatal gene transfer.",

LCMV glycoproteins can pseudotype retroviral and HIV-based lentiviral vectors facilitating studies of virus biology and gene transfer [1] [2] [3] . Encoded by the small RNA fragment, the arenavirus glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) is post-translationally cleaved to yield GP1 and GP2. GP1 is believed to be responsible for receptor binding followed by a pH-dependent fusion step mediated by GP2 [4, 5] . Several Old World arenaviruses utilize \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) as a viral receptor [6] . LCMV is the prototypic Old World arenavirus, with different strains displaying either high or low affinity for \u03b1-DG. Alpha-DG expression is developmentally regulated, displaying the highest expression levels in developing tissues involved in basement membrane assembly [7] . Expression rises during embryonic stages, peaks in the newborn, and diminishes in adult tissues [8, 9] . Here we develop and investigate the use of LCMV envelope glycoproteins with high or low \u03b1-DG affinity for lentiviral gene transfer applications.",

The dystroglycan complex is transcribed as a precursor peptide that undergoes post-translational cleavage to produce \u03b1and \u03b2-DG. Noncovalently linked, \u03b1and \u03b2-DG act as peripheral and transmembrane proteins, respectively. Interestingly, \u03b1-DG usage correlates with persistent infection, disease kinetics, and tropism [11] . The immunosuppressive LCMV isolates WE54, LCMV Cl13, and Traub efficiently target antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) in the spleen and perturb their ability to present antigen to T cells and B cells, resulting in a generalized immunosuppression of the host allowing viral persistence. These three LCMV strains bind to \u03b1-DG with high affinity, unlike non-immunosuppressive LCMV variants Armstrong 53b, CD4-1, CD8-4 and WE2.2, which demonstrate low affinity. LCMV Arm53b and WE2.2 replicate primarily in the splenic red pulp and infection is rapidly resolved. The tropism differences between LCMV strains, as well as significant infection of DG -/-ES cells by non-immunosuppressive LCMV variants [12] suggest that an alternate and currently unidentified viral receptor is utilized by LCMV strains with low affinity for \u03b1-DG [13] .",

LCMV WE54 and WE2.2 are also genetically similar with only one amino acid difference at position 153 of GP1. Genetic and phenotypic comparison of the New World arenavirus and LCMV variants led to the observation that amino acid 260 of GP1 plays an important role in their ability to utilize \u03b1-DG [12, 15] . Spiropoulou et al. generalized that a leucine or isoleucine residue at position 260 was required for high \u03b1-DG affinity, while bulky aromatic residues such as phenylalanine or tyrosine generally resulted in low affinity [16] . A similar change in affinity was observed between WE54 and WE2.2, the result of a serine to phenylalanine mutation at position 153 of GP1. Proper glycosylation, specifically Omannosylation [17] , and modifications of LARGE glycosyltransferase [18] also play important roles in receptor recognition by LCMV. However, LCMV isolates can transduce \u03b1-DG -/mouse ES cells with reduced efficacy, indicating that \u03b1-DG dependence is not absolute [3, 11, 19] . Utilization of an alternate receptor cannot be ruled out as a possibility.",

Able to withstand ultracentrifugation, LCMV glycoproteins yield MLV and HIV vector titers similar to the widely used amphotropic and VSV-G envelopes [1] [2] [3] . Stable cell lines constitutively expressing the WE54 envelope have been generated, demonstrating that the LCMV envelope exhibits little cytotoxicity in comparison to the VSV-G envelope [1] . Cannon and colleagues previously demonstrated successful pseudotyping of MLV-based retroviral vectors with the Armstrong 53b (Arm53b) envelope glycoprotein, and generated the F260L mutation in the Arm53b GP1 to generate a clone 13-like envelope with high \u03b1-DG affinity [3] . They successfully used these and other pseudotypes to investigate receptor use and \u03b1-DG affinity among several Old and New World arenavirus envelopes in vitro [3] . In this report we show that LCMV envelopes efficiently pseudotype a non-primate FIV lentiviral vector and maintain the entry properties seen in wild-type arenaviruses. Furthermore, we modified the WE54 LCMV envelope with the GP1 mutation L260F and altered vector \u03b1-DG affinity. Here we investigate the expression of \u03b1and \u03b2-DG in the liver at pre-and postnatal time points and document the in vivo tissue tropisms of these LCMV pseudotypes in neonatal and adult mice. We hypothesized that a FIV vector pseudotyped with a LCMV envelope glycoprotein with low \u03b1-DG binding affinity would yield unique in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer efficiency in neonatal animals.",

The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 minutes. A 50% suspension of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) agarose beads were then added (100 \u03bcl of packed beads per 100 mg of tissue) and incubated at 4\u00b0C with end over end rotation. The beads were washed 3X with 10 volumes of Tris buffered saline, pH 7.5 + 0.1% TX-100. The beads were eluted by boiling for 5 minutes in 1X Laemlli SDS sample buffer. Protein samples were separated on 3-15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blotted with the monoclonal antibody IIH6 recognizing the glycosylated form of \u03b1-DG (Upstate), or a polyclonal antibody against \u03b2-DG (Santa Cruz).

We hypothesized that changes in the levels of \u03b1-DG or other viral receptors expressed in newborn versus adult liver would influence the gene transfer efficiency with LCMV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. To test this hypothesis, we isolated WGA enriched glycoproteins from neonatal livers and compared the expression of \u03b1and \u03b2-DG by western blotting (Figure 1 ). The IIH6 antibody for \u03b1-DG recognizes the glycosylated form of \u03b1-DG that binds with high affinity to LCMV and laminin. Liver from E18 embryos and early postnatal liver showed high levels of IIH6 reactive \u03b1-DG, while in adult liver, IIH6 reactive \u03b1-DG was barely detected. In addition, \u03b2-DG levels were also high in late embryonic/ neonatal livers compared to adult animals. Interestingly, although the \u03b2-DG levels remained high in P0 and P2 embryos, the level of IIH6 reactive \u03b1-DG appeared to progressively decrease over this time window. This could either reflect a loss in the \u03b1-DG protein or a decrease in glycosylation efficiency with an overall effect of loss of functional \u03b1-DG on the cell surface.",

As shown in Figure 2A , pretreatment of A549 cells with either the ionophore monensin, which prevents endosomal acidification, or the weak base ammonium chloride inhibited transduction with FIV vectors pseudotyped with LCMV WE54 and [34] . From these findings, we conclude that the LCMV-WE54 envelope glycoproteins maintain their native entry and fusion properties when displayed on the FIV lentivirus, effectively changing the route of entry that FIV normally takes [35] .

In contrast, FIV pseudotyped with the baculovirus GP64 envelope successfully transduced adult murine tissues following each delivery route (Figure 4 and data not shown), as shown previously [26] .

Waiting an additional 10 minutes after IP delivery of D-luciferin allowed for luciferase expression to be detected from the hearts (arrows) in animals transduced with FIV-GP64 and FIV-L260F, while the hearts of FIV-WE54 transduced animals displayed no detectable signal. (B) Three weeks postinjection, the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys were harvested and luciferase assays conducted. Expression was detected exclusively from liver tissue (black bars) for all pseudoviruses tested and from hearts (gray bars) for the GP64 and L260F pseudoviruses. Standard errors are plotted and * denotes statistical significance (P \u2264 0.05) compared to FIV-WE54 livers. n = 5 for FIV-GP64 and FIV-WE54, 8 for FIV-L260F. Figures 6E, F) . Additionally, transduced livers from all animals displayed uniform staining throughout the tissue (Figures 6G-L) . Variability in transduction efficiency was observed between individual animals injected with the same vector, likely representing differences in the effective delivered doses. The FIV-L260F transduction efficiency ranged from 5-23% positive cells in liver sections and 1-7% positive cells in the heart. The cardiac transduction was patchy with predominate expression observed in cardiomyocytes. By morphological criteria, hepatocytes were the predominant target of liver cell transduction by all envelope glycoproteins tested ( Table 2) .",

Other strains of LCMV and additional members of the arenavirus family are \u03b1-DG receptor independent and typically display unique tropisms. Our modified WE54 envelope was generated using the knowledge that in the LCMV Arm53b strain, a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at position 260 of GP1 alters \u03b1-DG affinity. Incorporating this mutation into the LCMV WE54 glycoprotein did not negatively affect lentivirus titer and resulted in altered receptor affinity.

Wild-type LCMV WE54 bound approximately three times greater to immobilized \u03b1-DG than its pseudotyped counterpart ( Figure 3B ). There are multiple possible explanations for this observation. LCMV envelope glycoproteins normally form homotetramers on the virion surface. However, the HIV-1 and SIV lentiviruses have been demonstrated by electron tomography to possess as few as 8-10 trimers per virion [37] . Thus, glycoproteins displayed on the surface of FIV particles may not mirror presentation on native LCMV virions. This could reduce \u03b1-DG binding and might also decrease recognition by the monoclonal antibody used against GP2. A difference in the number of glycoproteins displayed on a virion may also lead to a disparity between wild-type and pseudotype receptor binding affinity. Regardless, the results of the viral neutralization and \u03b1-DG binding assays confirm that FIV-WE54 binds significantly better than vector with the LCMV L260F envelope.",

            "text": "Both LCMV envelopes transduced the neonatal liver following systemic delivery. Expression from the lentiviral vectors persisted at least 4 months (duration of the experiment). These same pseudotypes poorly transduced adult liver following tail vein injection while FIV-GP64 transduced the livers of both adult and neonatal mice. FIV-GP64 transduction, measured by bioluminescence, was slightly higher than LCMV pseudotypes following neonatal delivery. In contrast, FIV-WE54 and FIV-L260F failed to transduce adult mouse tissues following intravenous, intranasal, or intratracheal delivery. Of note, the LCMV WE54 pseudotype only transduced neural stem cells/progenitors following striatal injections in adult mouse brain, while the L260F pseudotype failed to transduce cells following striatal injections ( [38] and personal communication from Dr. Beverly Davidson). The difference in transduction efficiency between neonatal and adult animals suggests that arenavirus receptor expression varies considerably during development. Indeed our studies of \u03b1-DG expression neonatal vs adult liver tissues revealed a much higher level of expression of the IIH6 reactive form of alpha-dystroglycan perinatally compared to adult animals. We also did not detect any significant gene transfer by FIV-WE54 in skeletal muscle even though \u03b1-DG is abundantly expressed in these tissues. The glycan(s) present on \u03b1-DG that reacts with IIH6 is thought to be critical for LCMV binding and laminin binding. However, most of the \u03b1-DG in the neonatal liver was of a lower molecular weight (~120 kDa) than the \u03b1-DG glycoform that typically found in adult skeletal muscle (156 kDa), but comparable to what is found in brain dystroglycan (~120 kDa) [20] . The \u03b1-DG receptor, which the WE54 envelope binds with high affinity, exhibits higher expression in late embryonic and neonatal stages and declines thereafter [8, 9] . Interestingly, the infection patterns of developing brain by LCMV are also strikingly dependent on the age of the animal [39] . Therefore, although FIV-L260F shows a lower affinity for \u03b1-DG, the unique glycosylation patterns in neonatal liver may provide a virus-glycan interaction that favors low affinity arenavirus binding [18, 36] . There may also be developmentally regulated cell type specific differences in entry steps that occur after receptor binding, the tropism of the vector may be strongly affected by competition of the virus with other ligands that bind \u03b1-DG including laminin and other basement membrane proteins that are developmentally regulated. More studies are also needed to identify the potential alternative receptor for the \u03b1-DG low affinity arenaviruses, specifically of the Old World arenaviruses. This would allow characterization of the expression patterns of this receptor to determine if its developmental regulation contributes to arenavirus tropism.",

Further support of this hypothesis came from correlating vector transduction efficiencies and BrDU labeling in mice of different ages [41] . It is known that the rates of hepatocyte proliferation are higher in newborn than adult animals [42, 43] . A requirement for cell proliferation may also help explain the relatively low efficiency of LCMV pseudotyped vector tropism for adult striated muscle cells, which have high \u03b1-DG expression, but lack nearly any detectable mitotic activity under normal conditions. However, other physiological differences between neonatal and adult mice cannot be ruled out.",

A general observation was that heart transduction from FIV-L260F was primarily located in ventricular free walls, although rare transduction was also observed in the interventricular septum. Most expression was found in the outer 300 \u03bcm of the myocardium. In contrast, FIV-GP64 displayed more uniform transduction across the full thickness of the myocardium.

Hereditary disorders that cause specific organ damage prenatally or neonatally could be treated early before irreversible damage. The neonatal immune system is less mature, and may allow enhanced transduction and facilitate transgene tolerance [52, 53] . A practical advantage of neonatal gene transfer is that an increased delivered vector/body mass can be achieved experimentally, perhaps allowing for transduction of a larger number of the cells in a tissue, and increasing the likelihood of progenitor cell targeting when integrating vectors are used.
