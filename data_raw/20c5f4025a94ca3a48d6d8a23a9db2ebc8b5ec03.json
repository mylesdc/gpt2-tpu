            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the commonest lower respiratory tract illness in young children and the leading cause of hospitalization in this age group in the United States, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in children less than 2 years. 1, 2 Bronchiolitis is primarily a viral illness, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) followed by rhinovirus (RV) as the most common viral etiologies. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The clinical spectrum of disease varies from mild illness not requiring hospitalization to severe respiratory failure necessitating ventilatory support in the intensive care unit. In the first year of life, approximately 15-20% of children with RSV will seek medical attention. 8 The majority of these children (95%) are treated as outpatients, in primary care physician offices or the emergency department. 8 Young age and co-morbidities such as prematurity, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and immunodeficiency are important risk factors for hospitalization, 9, 10 but determining the severity of disease can be still difficult in young infants and methods often differ among institutions. 11 Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis and currently no standardized methods exist to aid the physician in determining the disposition of a patient. Clinicians commonly rely on parental history, clinical findings and the presence or absence of hypoxemia. Molecular diagnostics have improved our understanding of the viral etiology of bronchiolitis and the common occurrence of viral coinfections, 12 but there remains a clinical need for predictive biomarkers that can aid clinicians in the management and disposition of their patients with bronchiolitis.",

Samples were stabilized with viral transport media (Iscove media with 15% glycerol) in a 1:1 dilution and refrigerated at 4 degrees before being transported to the Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (CLIA ID 45D0919666) at Baylor College of Medicine. At the laboratory, specimens were divided into six aliquots of 0\u00c15-1 cc and snap-frozen in an alcohol-dry ice bath and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C. NPAs were generally processed within 24 hours of collection. Mucus presence in NPA specimens was evaluated weekly during enrollment by testing for the presence of secretory IgA (sIgA), a major immunoglobulin in mucosal defense, by a captured ELISA method using commercially available reagents ( 17, 18 ). Only five NPA samples from the enrolled children demonstrated inadequate sIgA levels; these subjects were not resampled.",

Interestingly, NW-caspase 3/7 activity differences among the disposition groups were not significant (P = 0\u00c14). However, NW-caspase 3/7 activity varied significantly by virus type (RSV only, RV only, RSV + RV or others, P = 0\u00c1004), as seen in Figure 2B . Those patients infected with RSV only had the highest caspase level in their nasal washes (mean AE SD, 4\u00c148 AE 0\u00c158), compared with those co-infected with both RSV and RV (4\u00c121 AE 0\u00c154), RV only (4\u00c117 AE 0\u00c152) or other types of viruses (3\u00c191 AE 0\u00c188). In addition, the NW-LDH/ NW-caspase 3/7 ratio difference between the disposition groups did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0\u00c107). However, when the children were divided into two disposition groups, hospitalized or not, the NW-LDH to NWcaspase 3/7 ratio in the hospitalized group was significantly higher (mean AE SD, 1\u00c115 AE 0\u00c148, median, 1\u00c115) than those children not hospitalized (1\u00c101 AE 0\u00c139, median 0\u00c198, P = 0\u00c103). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted using disposition of the patients (home, ACU, and ICU) as the primary outcome to identify demographic and biomarker variables that contributed to disposition. The analysis demonstrated that (i) Children younger than 3 months were more likely to be admitted to the ACU (OR: 3\u00c187, 95% CI: 1\u00c111-13\u00c150) versus being sent home compared to children older than 12 months; (ii) Compared with children who presented on day 6 of illness or later, children presenting on days 3-5 of symptoms were significantly more likely to be admitted to either the ACU (OR: 4\u00c107, 95% CI: 1\u00c134-12\u00c136) or ICU (OR 3\u00c169, 95% CI: 1\u00c114-11\u00c190); (iii) A one-unit increase in NW-LDH (log10, mU/l) was associated with an increased likelihood of admission to either the ACU (OR: 6\u00c168, 95% CI: 1\u00c153-29\u00c129) or ICU (OR 6\u00c110, 95% CI: 1\u00c128-28\u00c199); (iv) By contrast, a one-unit increase in NW-caspase 3/7 activity (log10, U/l) was associated with a decreased likelihood to be admitted to the ACU (OR: 0\u00c133, 95% CI: 0\u00c111-0\u00c196).

As an intracellular enzyme released upon cell injury, NW-LDH can be a marker of necrosis or apoptosis. Similar to our prior study, 13 RSV infection was associated with higher NW-LDH, and NW-LDH significantly correlated with NW-caspase 3/7. Unlike our prior studies where children with values in the upper quartile had a decreased risk of hospitalization, 13, 14 in this study an increasing concentration of NW-LDH was associated with an increasing likelihood of hospitalization to either the ACU or ICU. Children admitted to an ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children who were sent home or admitted to the ACU. These differences in predicting outcome are not readily explained; however, a higher proportion of this cohort required ICU care, (20\u00c16% versus 6\u00c11%) and none of the children had major co-morbidities compared with 25\u00c12% in Laham et al. study. 13 It is possible that our current cohort of children had more severe bronchiolitis, resulting in greater cellular injury to the airway epithelium. Thus, understanding the mechanisms (apoptosis versus necrosis) underlying the release of LDH might improve the prediction of outcomes, with the implication that NW-LDH from cells undergoing dysregulated inflammatory and necrotic processes results in more severe disease while NW-LDH originating from controlled apoptotic antiviral processes results in less severe disease.",

However, this report included a group of children who were older, healthier at baseline, presenting with more varied degree of illness, and had a greater proportion requiring a high level of care. Also, our samples were processed after only one freeze-thaw cycle; samples used for the earlier study underwent multiple freeze-thaw cycles, which may have adversely affected stability of the LDH isoenzymes and or quality of the samples. In our current study, we ensured the quality of our samples by providing feedback in real time on the detection of sIgA in the nasal wash fluid and using nasal wash samples thawed only once for determining LDH and caspase 3/7 activity. Also, in our previous reports, data on NW-LDH/ NW-caspase 3/7 ratio was not performed, which we believe helps to explain the dominant cellular pathway (necrosis versus apoptosis) from which LDH derives in respiratory tract fluid. As previously stated, our multiple linear models showed the same inverse relationship between NW-LDH (or NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio) and the severity of bronchiolitis for the children who were admitted to ACU compared with those sent home when taking into account the age of the patients.

Understanding the underlying relationship between LDH, caspase, and the innate immune response to respiratory viral pathogens will likely strengthen this predictive ability. Demographic variables and their interaction effects must also be considered when explaining the biomarkers of interest with respect to outcomes and disposition. The ratio of NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 reflects the innate immune balance between necrosis and apoptosis in controlling disease severity in children presenting with bronchiolitis. Our observations support the hypothesis that during the early immune response to control acute viral respiratory tract infection, an excess of necrosis of epithelial cells from either direct viral replication or a secondary inflammatory response is detrimental to the host versus a regulated apoptotic, antiviral pro-inflammatory pathway of epithelial cells designed to inhibit viral replication and progression of airway injury. Biomarkers like NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/ 7 that can help elucidate the pathogenesis of virally induced airway disease will likely serve as good predictive biomarkers in the clinical setting. Further study of LDH, caspase and other biomarkers may reveal novel targets for diagnostic tools that would aid clinicians in management and disposition of children with bronchiolitis.",
