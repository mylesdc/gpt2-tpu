Such viral pathogens are not easily distinguishable based on clinical findings alone [4] . Therefore, it is suggested that reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays should be performed in patients when a viral pathogen is suspected [5] .

However, only limited data exist regarding the prevalence of respiratory viruses among healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) patients. Additionally, considering the narrow range of antiviral agents against respiratory viruses and the potential harm of invasive respiratory sampling for RT-PCR in critically ill patients, it is crucial to reveal in which patients should the sampling be performed, and whether such detection leads to a change in the clinical management or outcome of patients.",

Previous studies have been conducted in children or with milder forms of pneumonia [24] . However, children have much higher rates of respiratory viral illnesses than adults and should be discussed separately, and severe pneumonia is of most interest in the ICU setting [6, 25] . Among the 23 patients whose management was changed, the most common change was in antiviral agents (n = 18). Currently, anti-influenza agents are the only actively used antiviral agents, and ribavirin is the only antiviral treatment option for non-influenza respiratory viruses [26] . Our study results emphasize the need for the development of novel antiviral agents against respiratory viruses. Apart from antiviral agents, respiratory viral detection in critically ill patients led to a reduction or cessation of immunosuppressant treatment in 3 patients. The use of high-dose steroids is known to be associated with a higher mortality rate and longer viral shedding in influenza A patients [27] . Therefore, it can be helpful to reduce the use of immune-modulating agents, including steroids, to improve patient outcomes. Two other patients stopped using empirical antibiotics, and their treatment focused on the respiratory viruses as pathogens. The long-term use of antibacterial agents in patients with viral pneumonia is known to increase the risk for developing multidrug-resistant pathogens and Clostridium difficile infection rather than improving clinical outcomes [28, 29] . The bacterial coinfection rate of the present study was similar to that of previous reports [8, 30] , which further supports the fact that patients with viral infection should be carefully examined for any additional bacterial infection. The most common bacterial pathogens of coinfection were common colonizers of the nasopharynx [31] . However, we failed to show a significant difference in mortality related to coinfection. This result is also consistent with previous reports, which showed comparable results for patients with and without bacterial coinfection [32] . The consequences of bacterial coinfection require further study.",

Fourth, the detection rate was lower than that of previous reports [21, 22] . The limited number of reported pathogens and inclusion of HAP may be responsible for this result.

Therefore, RT-PCR analysis should be actively performed for severe pneumonia in the ICU, especially among those with risk factors for viral infection. Furthermore, future efforts are required to develop novel antiviral agents for non-influenza respiratory viruses.",

This assay is based on the multiplex PCR method and uses a dual priming oligonucleotide system, which detects influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, RSV types A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E, NL63 and OC43, and rhinovirus. After 2014, the Anyplex TM II RV16 with Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension technology (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used. The RV16 uses 16 primer sets for the simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses: influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4, RSV types A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E, NL63 and OC43, rhinovirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus. Both assays are known to have good sensitivity and specificity",
