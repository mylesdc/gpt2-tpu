Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the PLOS ONE | N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells.",

The results revealed that the duck DV518 strain generated plaques that were larger and more heterogeneous in size than those generated by the DV413 strain (S1 Fig).

Both p518-L and p518-S strains had Asp residue at position 170 (170D) in HA that is different from the 170Asn (170N) in p413. It is possible that the substitution of N170D in HA has the potential to modulate viral binding to the cells. We thus investigated the ability of these viruses to bind to the MDCK and DF1 cells. To perform virus binding assays, MDCK or DF1 cells representing different receptor conformations [32, 33] were incubated with the four duck H5N2 viruses [p518-L, p518-S, p413, or DV30-2 (our earliest duck H5N2 isolate with HA-170Asn)] for comparison. The DV30 virus with a receptor specificity previously characterized by glycoarray as \u03b12,3 preference (Chung-Yi Wu and Chi-Huey Wong, personal communication), the typical avian-type specificity [34, 35] , was used to normalize the copy numbers of vRNA binding to the cells. After one hour's incubation at 4\u00b0C and extensive wash, the cells were collected for vRNA quantification by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig 5, both p518-L and p518-S strains had significantly higher capacity to bind to MDCK cells than did p413 virus (p<0.05). In addition, these two p518 strains also had higher capacity to bind to avian DF1 cells than did p413, though the difference among them was insignificant, indicating their common specificity to \u03b12,3 receptors. All these results suggest that the substitution of N170D in HA may have the potential to modulate viral binding to MDCK cells, contributing to the better growth of DV518 and its derived two plaque-purified strains in mammalian cells.",

However, few viral replication studies focus on duck LPAI H5N2 viruses. In this study, we characterized the phenotypic variations between the two genetically close duck LPAI H5N2 influenza viruses and revealed three major findings that helped us better understand the epidemiological aspects of influenza. First, variations of LPAI H5N2 viruses involved both intra-host and inter-host levels in ducks that may increase viral diversity, population dynamics, and continuous evolution. Second, intra-duck variations (shown in p518-L vs p518-S) included three residue substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T), whereas inter-duck variations (shown in DV518 vs DV413) contained the other three mutations in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H). These differences indicate that two levels of viral variations were involved in the mutations of different genes. Third, phenotypic variations of duck influenza p518-L strain with better replication in MDCK cells (compared to p518-S and p413) imply that duck-LPAI viruses may have a stronger potential to infect mammalian hosts under certain epidemiological settings [30, 36, 37] . Taken together, these findings provide new insight on the genotypic and phenotypic variations of LPAI H5N2 viruses from an individual duck to the entire duck population, prior to the process of expanding epizootic potential, and infecting other hosts.",

            "text": "Identifying the molecular determinants involved in genotypic and phenotypic variations of duck influenza viruses can help to understand mechanisms for viral persistence in nature, inter-species transmission, and elevated pathogenicity and virulence leading to severe epidemics and pandemics [13] . AIVs in waterfowl (predominantly wild ducks), which are important viral maintenance hosts, vary in infection susceptibility, exit routes, levels of viral excretion, and shedding patterns among different wild duck species [38] . Generally, these natural hosts infected with AIVs are asymptomatic or have mild infections. Several species of wild and domestic ducks are \"silent spreaders\" serving as the \"Trojan horses\" for influenza viruses [39] . Most importantly, certain AIV strains have the capability to cross host range barriers and infect other species, including humans. However, the selection mechanisms of LPAI virus among poultry ducks, which bridge natural maintenance hosts and other host species, are not well understood. Our data showed that the duck DV518 strain can grow to titers significantly higher than the duck DV413 strain in both mammalian MDCK and avian DF1 cell lines, thus implying the existence of factors that may contribute to viral replication. Moreover, the three plaque-purified strains, p518-L, p518-S, and p413, exhibited more complicated replication profiles: p518-L and p518-S replicated more efficiently than p413 in MDCK cells but showed comparable efficiency to that of p413 in DF1 cells. Evaluations of viral cell binding were in accordance with the growth advantages of both p518-L and p518-S strains in MDCK cells. Furthermore, varied viral polymerase activities between these two strains in 293T cells suggest that the difference in viral replication may be conferred by polymerase activities in host-specific cell lines. These findings not only support the importance of routine virological surveillance to understand and identify the phenotypic diversity of duck influenza viruses isolated from the same and different ducks, but also provide important information about virus evolution in both individual and population levels.",

Detailed sequence analysis indicated that these two variants differed only at three positions (Table 1) , and two of them are located in the components of the viral polymerase complex. These data indicate that the replication advantage of the AIV variants with minor genetic variation can be selected for within the same duck. How the amino acid variations in PB2, PA, and M1 contribute to the higher polymerase activity in p513-L is unclear. The minigenome assay was conducted at 9 h p.i. (a single replication cycle). This would exclude the possible involvement of mutation in M1, a protein known to play a role in vRNP export [40] . Position 72 in the PB2 is located in the PB2-N1 subdomain buttressing the PB1 thumb domain [41] . However, it is less likely that the mutation (from glutamate to aspartate without changing the charge) in p513-L would affect the function of the PB2 protein significantly. In PA, the mutation of S224P with other amino acid substitutions has been shown to increase the replication of duck H5N1 viruses in duck primary embryo fibroblast cells [42] , and elevate viral virulence in a mouse model [42] . Whether the change at position 224 in PA (from proline to serine) may increase the polymerase activity of p513-L virus requires further investigation.",

            "text": "By contrast, inter-host variations of the two Taiwan-H5N2 DV518 and DV413 viruses were isolated from fecal droppings between poultry ducks (collected on July 28 and September 7, 2006 at a wholesale LPM (16) where ducks came from Yilan and Yunlin counties). These two viruses involved another three amino acid changes (N170D, I56T, and Y289H) in HA, NA, and NP, respectively [43] [44] [45] . DV518, p518-L and p518-S strains all have a 170D residue in HA in contrast to a 170N in DV413 and p413. Our data indicated that p518-L and p518-S viruses bind to MDCK cells, which possess both \u03b12,6 and \u03b12,3 receptors [33] , more efficiently than the p413 virus (Fig 5) . Furthermore, these three virus strains showed no significant difference in binding to A549 and DF1 cells (S5 Fig), which possess predominantly \u03b12,6 and \u03b12,3 receptors, respectively [32, 33] , indicating that the receptor specificity of these viruses may not have been altered. Position 170 (or 158 in H3 structural numbering) is located at the tip of the HA (S6 Fig), near the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the globular head of HA1 [46] . This N170D (or N158D) mutation in HA has been correlated with better aerosol transmissibility of H5N1 viruses in ferrets [31] and guinea pigs [47] as well as human H5N1 cases in Vietnam and Egypt [48, 49] . Moreover, a quail-adapted duck H3N2 virus (i.e. virus adaption in terrestrial birds from aquatic birds) possessing HA-170D mutation replicated more efficiently in MDCK cells, even though these viruses had receptor specificities similar to those of the parental duck virus, and exhibited the potential to infect human cells in vitro and ex vivo [36] . The possible mechanism of this selection advantage might be attributable to the role of aspartate in increasing the negative charge on the surface of HA (a marker for adaptation to cultured mammalian cells) [50] (S6A and S6B Fig illustrate the polarity change of HA) . Taken together, these results and findings by others suggest that N170D of HA does not alter the receptor specificity but may enhance its receptor-binding affinity by forming a more stable structure [31, 50, 51] . In other words, both p513-L and p513-S show enhanced binding to MDCK cells and the substitution of N170D in HA has the potential to modulate viral binding to MDCK cells. Whether the N170D mutation does contribute to the better binding of p518-L and p518-S to MDCK cells requires further investigation by using reverse genetics methods.",

Due to the infidelity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and large population sizes, many different genetic alterations may occur during RNA genome replication. Among these heterogeneous viral populations, minor viral variants may have significant implications for quasispecies evolution [66] . Our duck LPAI H5N2 viruses had slow evolution and stable viral sequences, because the viral sequences remained the same after one passage in chicken eggs and through several steps of plaque-purification (data not shown). However, the selection of AIVs does occur in poultry ducks, because neither p518-L nor p518-S is identical to the original DV518 isolate in full-genome sequences. This result indicates that the overall virus population derived from the field is a mixture of heterogeneous sub-populations of viral variants. Our finding on intra-and inter-duck phenotypic variations of the viruses which occurred at a cellular level is consistent with previous studies from duck samples demonstrating varied biological characteristics [14] and LPAI H1N9 and H6N1 isolates from wild birds replicates in ferrets [67] . For inter-duck variants, DV518 had growth advantage over DV413. For intra-duck variants, a minor sub-population of variants such as p518-L may have growth advantage in mammalian cells, causing health problem in humans after further evolution.",

            "text": "There are four major limitations to this study. First, the viral mutations identified from this study need further investigation, using reverse genetic approaches to determine whether a single mutation or multiple co-mutations were required to enhance viral replication in mammalian cells. Moreover, whether DV518 and its derivative viruses could multiply more efficiently than DV413 and its derivative virus in mice or other primates needs to be investigated. Second, the original samples amplified in the SPF eggs may not represent the viral population in the host [17] . Third, the two genetically close duck H5N2 viruses we studied cannot reflect the whole of viral population dynamics and selection in ducks, nor the previously reported H5N2 viruses in chickens in Taiwan [13] . In reality, whether the studied duck viruses have other additional unidentified subpopulations remains unclear. Fourth, the roles of host or environmental factors or concurrent infection of multiple subtypes of AIVs in intra-or interhost evolution of duck H5N2 viruses deserve further investigation. Fully understanding the spectrum of viral variants (various percentages of the subvariants) and their roles in viral phenotypic variations through selection and fitness with trends in becoming dominant subvariants requires more modernized laboratory methods (such as reverse genetics, next generation sequencing) to provide stronger conclusion.",

            "text": "In summary, this study reveals several molecular determinants that may enhance cell binding and replication of duck LPAI H5N2 virus in MDCK cells. As anti-H5N2 seropositive poultry workers were detected [68] , molecular markers for increasing viral replication as well as higher ability to inhibit antiviral immunity will be helpful in selecting the best strain for a future cell-based human H5N2 vaccine. The higher binding to and the greater replication capability of DV-518 (particularly DV-518-L) in MDCK cells implies that duck influenza virus sub-variants may possess potential for inter-species transmission to mammalian hosts. Such mutation events involve a series of host adaptations and selection, which may result in a novel virus with increasing replication efficiency, pathogenicity, and pandemic potential, as recently observed with novel H5N8 AIVs causing poultry outbreaks worldwide [69, 70] . Taken together, the integrated information from the micro-evolution of the virus to population dynamics can provide us with better clues about various selection mechanisms involving route of infection, receptor binding, replication efficiency, virion packaging, herd immunity, and efficient transmissibility [71] . In view of the most recent severe and fatal human cases caused by novel LPAI H7N9, H6N1 and H10N8 viruses [6, 7, 72] , there is an increasing need to gain more knowledge about molecular determinants associated with host range and inter-species transmission of LPAI viruses. Therefore, efforts to establish integrated surveillance in areas involving wild birds, poultry ducks, chickens and mammalian hosts are urgently needed. By using whole-genome, deep pyrosequencing analysis and phenotypic characterizations, the evolutionary features of AIVs at a sub-population level after passaging through either avian or mammalian cells can be used to identify host-specific molecular markers associated with alterations in viral replication [61, 73] . A series of studies focused on an H7N9 drug-resistant subpopulation and their fitness in vivo can serve as a good example [74, 75] . This effort will help us fully understand the selection mechanisms and dynamic changes of molecular determinants in different host species at both micro-and macro-levels, leading to improved risk assessment, vaccine development and pandemic preparedness.",
