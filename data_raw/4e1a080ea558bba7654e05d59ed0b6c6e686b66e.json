The aerosolizability of MS was modified by increasing its cohesivity, thereby reducing the number of particles expelled from the SCM while interfering minimally with its clearance on the frog palate. An unexpected finding is that MS crosslinking increased \"expectoration\".

Mucomodulators work differently than mucolytics, since the latter were designed to disrupt the structural macromolecules that give respiratory tract mucus its physical characteristics, and from other agents designed to increase mucus flow by stimulating ciliary activity or improving periciliary fluid hydration. As used here, mucomodulators act to increase the cohesivity of airway mucus simulants. Mucomodulator therapy to combat mucus retention may become a major consideration in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases in which mucus hypersecretion and impaired airway clearance produce symptoms [11] , and require adequate and novel secretion management. With the mucomodulator approach, we intend to adjust or regulate the mucin macromolecules that give respiratory mucus its physical characteristics in order to minimize the aerosolization that facilitates transmission of airborne diseases.
