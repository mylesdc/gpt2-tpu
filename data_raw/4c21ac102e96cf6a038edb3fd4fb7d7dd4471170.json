            "text": "Background: Recruit training sites are places with a high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. Effective surveillance for acute respiratory infectious diseases in a recruit training site is an important way to prevent disease outbreaks. Methods: Eight hundred recruits (722 males and 78 females) enlisted in autumn 2015 received a background survey within 24 h of settlement at the recruit training site, including their general personal information, vaccination history, mental status and clinical symptoms. Then, nasopharyngeal swabs of these recruits were collected to detect common respiratory pathogens [influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, adenovirus (Adv), human respiratory syncytial virus, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus] by PCR. In addition, fasting venous blood was collected in the morning for adenovirus IgG antibody detection. During the three months of training, the recruits were monitored for symptoms of respiratory infection, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from those with an axillary temperature \u226538\u00b0C and other respiratory symptoms within 4 h of symptom onset. Samples were further examined by PCR. Results: Among the 795 effective nasopharyngeal swab samples collected during survey, two cases of group C type 1 adenovirus were identified by PCR. During the 3 months of training, fever and respiratory symptoms occurred in 39 recruits (incidence rate of 4.9%) and 5 cases of adenovirus were detected (positive rate of 12.8%). Genotyping showed 3 cases of type 4 adenovirus and 2 of type 3 adenovirus. No type 7, 14 or 55 adenovirus was detected. The Adv-IgG positive rate of recruits was 48.2%. Among the 5 Adv positive cases with fever and respiratory symptoms, 4 were Adv-IgG positive. Conclusion: The pathogen carrier rate in recruits was low, and only group C adenovirus, which causes mild infection in humans, was detected. No respiratory outbreak was observed at the recruit training site, and sporadic cases were mainly caused by type 3 and type 4 adenoviruses.",

Therefore, ARDs have become an important part of military medical study. Recruit training is a necessary step and effective way for improving the quality of troops and guaranteeing their combat capacity. During the training period, intensive physical training and changes in lifestyle, living environment and social support expose the recruits to different types of injuries, including physical injuries and ARDs [2, 3] . Furthermore, due to dramatic weather changes, the incidence of ARDs is higher in autumn and winter when recruitment in China usually occurs, and recruits are sensitive to respiratory infections. In recent years, a number of massive ARDs epidemics associated with adenovirus infection have occurred at recruit training sites [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , causing significant damage to soldiers' health and imposing a huge burden of health protection and disease prevention in the troops [9] .",

From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, the United States (US) military had implemented the ARDs surveillance program [10] . This program helped track and monitor all hospitalized recruits with ARDs. Over the past decade (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) , the US military insisted on this program and has monitored patients with uncomplicated febrile ARDs (such as nonhospitalized patients). This program has been implemented for nearly 50 years, and it has been immensely valuable in identifying clusters of respiratory diseases among U.S. Army trainees [10] . Surveillance of febrile respiratory diseases was introduced in 2013 in China, when the ARDs pathogens surveillance network laboratories and surveillance sites were established [9] .",

            "text": "We performed a general survey on pathogens responsible for respiratory infectious diseases at a recruit training site for the first time. To improve the data quality, we selected commercial kits for preliminary screening. The results showed that the pathogen carrier rate in recruits without respiratory symptoms was very low, and among 795 nasopharyngeal swab samples, only two were adenovirus-positive; they were identified as group C type 1 adenovirus with low virulence. During the 3 months of training, 5 cases of adenovirus were detected among 39 recruits with fever and respiratory symptoms, indicating that adenovirus is the major causal pathogen for respiratory infectious disease at recruit training sites. According to retrospective studies on respiratory infections in troops during the past 25 years in the USA, the most common ARDs pathogens in troops are adenovirus, influenza [10] . As early as the World War I, \"Spanish flu\" occurred in U.S. troops (1917) (1918) , and studies exploring the prevention and control of ARDs were initiated and have continued i.e., for approximately 100 years. In China, such surveillance only started 3 years ago. There is still a lack of comprehensive information regarding the spectrum of febrile respiratory diseases. During the Vietnam War period (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) , RSV infection ranked second among the febrile respiratory diseases affecting US troops, surpassed only by adenovirus infection (21.0%) [11] . According to a survey [12] , RSV accounts for 0.73% of pathogens of upper respiratory tract infections in Chinese troops, less than the infection rates of mycoplasma pneumonia and Legionella. However, we did not detect RSV positive cases in this investigation, nor did we find metapneumovirus or bocavirus. These viruses are common in upper respiratory tract infections that affected children, but they are less common in Chinese adults [13, 14] , which suggests that these pathogens will not be detected in future background investigations and pathogen surveillances. Adenovirus infection usually spreads quickly, which may cause seasonal epidemics. In foreign military camps, most febrile respiratory diseases are caused by human adenovirus types 4, 7, 14 and 55 infections [10, 15] . In Chinese troops, most pathogens that have caused massive epidemics in recent years have been adenovirus types 7, 14 and 55 [16] ; of these, type 55 accounted for more than 50% of all infections. In the present study, human adenovirus type 55 was not detected, and massive respiratory infection outbreaks did not occur. According to several adenovirus infection outbreaks in the past, diseases caused by adenovirus type 7 are mild and, compared with infection by adenovirus type 55, their incidence of pneumonia is low. In the event of pneumonia, it is mainly mild, and has a short course and good prognosis, without severe cases [4] [5] [6] [7] . In this study, group B adenovirus types 4 and 3 are the main types causing febrile respiratory diseases. According to previous reports, adenovirus types 4 and 7 are the main types that caused mass outbreaks of upper respiratory tract diseases in US troops in the 1970s, while adenovirus type 4 infections caused the deaths of many soldiers [10, 17] . Usually, symptoms of HAdv-3 infection are mild, and we found upper respiratory infections in only two cases, without pneumonia or other complications.",

            "text": "The recruits in the training site were from the central and northern parts of China, and an adenovirus IgG positive rate of 48.2% was obtained. Statistical data showed no difference in the IgG-positive rates between provinces, or between urban and rural areas (data not shown). The previously reported infection rate of adenovirus in the population is close to 50% [18, 19] , but after detecting Adv-IgG in people with febrile respiratory symptoms, we found that among 4 of 5 Adv positive cases were Adv-IgG positive. Of note, more than 50 serotypes of human adenovirus can cause clinical symptoms, and there is no cross-protection between them [16] . We detected total IgG against adenovirus, and only type-specific neutralizing antibodies have a protective effect [19] . Therefore, although the Adv-IgG positive rate in the recruits was as high as 48.2%, mass infections of adenovirus types 4, 7, 14 and 55 may still occur, which can be explained by the multiple mass adenovirus epidemics that occurred in recent years. Specially, HAdV-55, derived from a recombination of adenovirus types 11 and 14, has caused a number of outbreaks in the troops in recent years [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . According to the HAdV-55 infection epidemic situations in late 2011 and early 2012, over 6300 people were exposed to the virus, and nearly one thousand soldiers were infected, all of whom were young adults. There was severe illness in more than 30% of cases and one death [20] . However, no outbreaks have been reported in crowded nurseries and non-military institutions. The USA is the sole country where recruits receive adenovirus vaccination. During Adv-4 and Adv-7 vaccination in the period from mid-1970s to 1999, the incidence of febrile respiratory diseases in US troops was greatly reduced; however, Wyeth Pharmaceutical stopped the production of adenovirus vaccines in 1996. Additionally from 1999 (when vaccines in stock were used up) to 2011, the incidence of febrile respiratory diseases rose to the level prior to vaccination. In the two years from 2011 to 2013, when adenovirus vaccine inoculation recovered, the burden of adenovirus infection diseases in American recruits was reduced 100-fold; These data strongly supported the production and administration of Adv-4 and Adv-7 vaccines to control febrile respiratory diseases, and suggested the implementation of continuous surveillance for emerging adenovirus subtypes [21] . To prevent and control massive adenovirus epidemics, the development and administration of vaccines should be included in the plans of the Chinese army to ensure that the intensive research should be done on the basic research and industrial production of vaccine, and the health economic value of vaccine should be evaluated at the same time.",

            "text": "Symptom and pathogen surveillance is the first step in ARDs prevention and control. Epidemiological surveys should be performed when the ARDs incidence rate is higher than the level in the same period from a year prior. The situation should be reported to the army and government leaders, and disease surveillance should be performed as early as possible to propose prevention and control strategies. This background information and pathogen surveillance mainly focused on flu and adenovirus infection that easily cause massive epidemics of respiratory infectious disease. No influenza virus A or B was detected, which is probably because community influenza virus did not spread to the military camp or maybe because of false negative results. Because the pathogen detection rate in this study was low (12.8%), no pathogen was detected in 34 cases, which is likely due to the inappropriate time and method of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs in addition to the sensitivity of detection reagents. Five cases of group B adenovirus detected in patients with febrile respiratory diseases in this study were not associated with the 2 cases of group C adenovirus type 1 found in the background survey. Epidemiological analysis revealed that the five patients were sporadic cases who had a history of contact with outsiders. From the end of 2011 to early 2012, Adv 55-type mass outbreaks occurred twice. The veterans were infected outside, and the recruits and veterans had cross spreading. In addition, due to off-site training, spreading across camps occurred [20] . Epidemiological survey and whole-genome sequencing revealed that the two massive outbreaks of adenovirus infections in different places during the period from December 2012 to February 2013 were caused by the same strain of adenovirus type 7 [22] . Recruits infected in the first outbreak were in close contact with an individual from the training site where the second outbreak occurred during their hospitalization, and the latter brought the virus back to the other recruit training camp, causing another Adv-7 epidemic in a distant training site [22] . Therefore, detailed epidemiological survey and whole-genome sequencing can provide useful information for infection control and intervention. In this regard, we can learn from American troops. The respiratory surveillance program in the US includes all cases and disease courses, and it especially implements self-isolation management of patients who temporarily stop training due to febrile respiratory diseases. For example, patients are isolated for at least 8 h in a special separated room or outpatient clinic, or their scope of activities is limited upon their returned to training.",
