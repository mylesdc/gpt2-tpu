The most commonly detected viruses in the hospitalized cases were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 33.3%) in children less than two years old, adenoviruses (13.0%) in patients 15-34 years old, and influenza viruses (IFVs, 9.6%) in patients \u226565 years. IFVs were the most common virus in outpatient/ED patients across all age groups (22.7%). After controlling for the confounders caused by other viruses and covariates, adenoviruses (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.97, 99% confidence interval [99% CI]: 2.19-7.20) and RSV (aOR: 2.04, 99% CI: 1.34-3.11) were independently associated with increased hospitalization in children, as well as adenoviruses in adults (aOR: 2.14, 99% CI: 1.19-3.85). Additionally, co-infection of RSV with IFVs was associated with increased hospitalization in children (aOR: 12.20,. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of ARIs was associated with respiratory viruses in North China. RSV, adenoviruses, and co-infection of RSV and IFVs were more frequent in hospitalized children (or adenoviruses in adults), which might predict the severity of ARIs. Attending clinicians should be more vigilant of these infections.",

In a substantial proportion of patients, ARIs are found to be associated with respiratory viruses (RVs) [1, [4] [5] [6] . In addition to their high frequency, infection with RVs can lead to severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death [1] . Notably, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes most of the severe LRTIs in young children [7] , while influenza viruses (IFVs) and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the predominant causative agents in hospitalized adults with pneumonia [8] .",

These studies are very helpful for characterizing the prevalence and burden of specific RVs in pre-vaccine Chinese populations (i.e., vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and influenza viruses are currently not incorporated into the national immunization program [17] ). In addition, these studies are useful to identify new emerging viral infections [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, few previous studies have studied RVs across different hospital settings (e.g., outpatient, emergency room, inpatient wards and intensive care units) and explored etiological, environmental and host factors that predisposed patients to severe disease presentation, such as hospitalization or intensive care admission. It is very important to clarify the most common viral agents causing ARIs and their relationship with the severe disease presentation for clinicians who treated their patients with ARIs at different hospital settings.",

To assess and quantify the contribution of a specific virus without regard to the presence of other pathogens, this model includes all tested respiratory viruses as well as their two-way interactions. In this case, the effect of co-infection upon hospitalization of ARIs, assigned as interaction term of pairs of viruses, could be explained as the excessive increment/decrement of hospitalization that could not be explained by additive effects or confounding of either composite virus. Variables (e.g., age, gender, surveillance year, and season of illness onset), were also included in multivariable model to account for potential confounding if significant at p < 0.10 in bivariate analysis.

The wide use of modern molecular techniques enables rapid diagnosis and greatly improves our understanding on the clinical role of respiratory viruses [24] . The high sensitivity of these testing methods reveals multiple pathogens in respiratory specimens (about 12%-42% of hospitalized children with ARIs had two or more viruses identified [5, 6, 25] ). However, these results were often clinically confusing as it is difficult to distinguish whether the viruses were colonized or prolonged shedding from infection [26] . A better understanding of the distribution of a specific RVs in patients with ARIs in different hospital settings and their interactive relationship with other microbial agents can help clinicians make a better assessment of the role of RVs in the current infections. Toward this end, we simultaneously screened for the presence of eight common respiratory viruses in 9924 patients with ARIs in outpatient and inpatient settings at 11 hospitals in North China. After adjusting for other viruses and significant confounding factors, the detection of RSV, HAdVs, and co-infection of RSV with IFVs was still significantly higher in hospitalized children (or HAdVs in adults) with ARIs than in non-hospitalized children. These data suggest that these infections might predict the severity of ARIs.",

            "text": "IFVs are important causing agents of ARIs [4, 30] , and were reported to be the most common identified agent in hospitalized adults [8, 32, 33] . In our study, IFVs was also the most common agent in hospitalized patient \u226565 years. Interestingly, co-infection of RSV with IFVs was a significant predicator of increased hospitalization among young children in our study. Although IFVs were found more frequently among outpatient/ED patients (22.7%) than among hospitalized cases (7.3%), 91.1% of children co-infected with RSV and IFVs were admitted to the hospital. This was significantly higher than children hospitalized with the single infection of RSV (72.2%, n = 166/230) or IFVs (23.8%, n = 57/240). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that co-infection of IFVs with other microbial agents, like RSV in our study, might have played an important role in the hospitalization of ARIs in young children as has been described previously [34] . Both RSV and IFVs have caused substantial burden worldwide [7, 35, 36] , and the epidemic season of RSV and IFVs are partly overlapping for winter months in China [11] . If our hypothesis that co-infection of IFVs with other microbial agents will cause more severe ARIs among young children is true, the immunization of young children with seasonal influenza vaccine would certainly offer additional benefits by preventing not only IFVs-associated hospitalizations, but also the excessive hospitalizations caused by co-infected RSV or other microbial agents. Since currently no influenza vaccines have been introduced into China's routine immunization program, vaccination of the elderly people and young children with seasonal influenza vaccine should be considered a high priority to reduce the large burden of ARIs among these population groups at high risk of more severe disease. In our study, viral infection was more common in inpatients than outpatients among younger age group but not older age group. This observation suggests that RVs infection is common among young children and is more likely to be associated with severe ARIs when compared with other age groups, while in adults and elderly people, though RVs infection is not uncommon, RVs are less likely to cause severe ARIs in this age group. Moreover, we also found co-infection of two or more viruses in 15%-35% of hospitalized young children as opposed to 2%-10% of hospitalized adults. Higher proportions of co-infection were observed in hospitalized young children than in non-hospitalized children (5%-9%). These results suggest that viral co-infection might predict hospitalization of young children but not of adults. Aging is a protecting factor for RVs infections in young children. As the age of children increased, infection and co-infection of RVs became less frequent and were less likely to be associated with hospitalization. This observation suggested that the frequent exposure of children to RVs could lower their risk of RVs-associated infection and/or severe infection, and that the utility of vaccines, when available, could be used to control and prevent the infection of RVs. The most frequent combination of viral co-infection among hospitalized children was RSV with HRVs, which is consistent with that of previous studies [5, 6, 25, 37, 38] . In studies by Papadopoulos et al. and Aberle et al., co-infection of RSV with HRVs was associated with prolonged stay in the hospital in patients with bronchiolitis [25, 37] . In our study, however, the strength of association with hospitalization for RSV co-infected with HRVs was at a marginal value (significant at p < 0.05 but not p < 0.01), which warrants investigation in future studies.",

In addition, HAdVs in our study were more frequent in hospitalized children and young adults than in outpatient/ED patients. HAdVs are important agents associated with severe ARIs, for several serotypes of HAdVs (e.g., HAdV-3, 7, 14 and 55), might induce severe and fatal necrotizing pneumonia [26, [40] [41] [42] . The host response to HAdVs infection is very similar to that of invasive bacterial infections [43] . In our previous study of the same population in North China, we found that 49% of identified HAdVs were HAdV-7 [44] . We believe that certain serotypes of HAdVs, e.g. HAdV-7, were more prevalent in this population, which played an important role in the hospitalization of children and young adults in our study. Future studies which sought to sequence the identified HAdVs strains are warranted.",

First, we did not include an asymptomatic control in our study but rather made comparisons between patient subgroups at different hospital settings which might make the results difficult to interpret. Yet finding no difference does not mean that there is no association of specific virus with the hospitalization of patients. However, the heterogeneous distribution of RVs in patient subgroups at different hospital settings deserved attention from clinicians when treating these patients. Second, we only investigated 2way interactions of viruses. The interactions and bacterial-viral infections were not explored. Third, other host factors were not examined in our study, such as those underlying diseases (e.g. exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or cardiovascular diseases), and the previous usage of antibiotics or steroids. The issue of viral-viral co-infection associated with severity of ARIs still remains controversial as laid down by others [6, 45, 46] . Future studies that test multi-pathogens using common standards at multi-sites, employ appropriate community controls and use death as clinical endpoints are warranted.",

Thus, clinicians treating patients with ARIs should be vigilant of these infections.
