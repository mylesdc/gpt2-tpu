Four pairs of miRNA sequences were designed and synthesized that targeted different regions of the gag gene. The screened target (i.e., the gag genes) was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0-77.3%. To avoid the generation of escape variants during virus infection, expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs were constructed using the multi-target serial strategy (against different regions of the gag, pol, and env genes). Multi-target miRNAs were shown to play a synergistic role in the inhibition of ALV-J replication, with an inhibition efficiency of viral replication ranging from 85.0-91.2%. Conclusion: The strategy of multi-target miRNAs might be an effective method for inhibiting ALV replication and the acquisition of resistant mutations.",

First, RNAi has sequence specificity. Second, the application of multi-series RNAi can target different genes or sequences simultaneously and hence can minimize the possibility of the virus acquiring mutations that confer resistance. Third, RNAi can be transmitted from nonpathogenic viruses to pathogenic viruses. Finally, due to its sequence specificity, siRNA designed against a virus can only inhibit that virus, leaving vaccine strains unaffected. To ensure a high level of RNAi gene silencing, multiple miRNAs can be designed. These can be transfected into cells using the same transfer medium, and by targeting different sequences, mutation of the target virus, and therefore the probability of evasion from the silencing effect of the miRNA is minimized.",

RNAi technology have been applied in numerous studies including those for HBV [11] , HCV [12] , HIV-1 [13] , influenza virus A [14] , aphthovirus of cattle [15, 16] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [17] infections. RNAi has been used to suppress the replication of herpesviruses, including Murine herpesvirus 68 [18] , Herpes simplex virus-1 [19] , Human cytomegalovirus [20] , and Duck herpesvirus [21] . The ALV-J genome contains a gene arrangement of LTR-leader-gag-pol-env-LTR. The gag and pol genes are highly conserved, sharing 96-97% homology in ALV-J, in contrast to subgroups A, C, and D. The pol gene mainly encodes the reverse transcriptase (RT; P68) and viral integrase (IN; P32). RT is responsible for the production of proviral DNA using viral RNA as a template, while IN is involved in the integration of proviral DNA into the host genome. The pol gene is necessary for reverse transcription of the RNA genome and the generation of viral DNA, and it is a key to the insertion of the viral genome into the host genome. RNAi has been applied to the inhibition of ALV replication by a number of research groups. Chen et al. [8] successfully inhibited ALV-B replication induced by a retroviral vector by targeting the miRNA of the ALV-B env gene and its receptor encoded by the tvb gene.",

These results showed that miRNA expression could inhibit the duplication of the target gag gene, with mi-gag1318 having the highest inhibitory effect.

[7] showed that by electroporation into chicken embryos, siRNA containing ALV gag sequences effectively slowed down virus propagation. In the current study, the miRNA target gag1318 was selected that resulted in significant inhibitory effects on ALV-J replication. These miRNAs were grouped in pairs or together, and the tandem multi-target miRNAs target mi-g1318-p2516, mi-g1318-e1384, mi-p2516-e1384, and mi-g1318-p2516-e1384 were co-expressed, reducing the probability of evasion from the silencing effect of the miRNA due to virus mutation. When multiple miRNAs were expressed simultaneously, gene silencing was shown to be more effective. Tandem plasmids were transfected into DF-1 cells and then infected with ALV-J. IFA, western blotting, and quantitative PCR were used to evaluate the inhibiting effects on ALV-J replication at the cellular level. The results verified that all of the tandem plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of ALV in DF-1 cells, with an inhibition efficiency of 85-91.2%. The enhanced inhibitory effects conferred by the multi-target miRNA expression plasmids demonstrated that the multi-target miRNAs could inhibit ALV synergistically. These studies successfully identified targets capable of inhibiting the replication of ALV-J and are likely to be good candidates for the development of miRNA-based vaccines. The current study showed that the strategy of using multi-target miRNAs might be an effective method for inhibiting viral replication and for the acquisition of resistant mutations. ",
