            "text": "Background: Clostridium difficile carriage has been considered as a potential source for the deadly infection, but its role in cancer patients is still unclear. We aimed to identify the clinical and immunological factors that are related to C. difficile carriage in Chinese cancer patients. Methods: A total of 400 stool samples were collected from cancer patients who received chemotherapy in three hospitals of eastern China. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted and two toxin genes (tcdA and tcdB) were detected. PCR ribotyping was performed using capillary gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: Eighty-two (20.5%) samples were confirmed to be C. difficile-positive and positive for tpi, tcdA, and tcdB genes. The C. difficile-positive rates in patients with diarrhea and no diarrhea were 35% and 19.7%, respectively (p = 0.09). Patients who were younger than 50 years old and were hospitalized for at least 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate as high as 35%. In contrast, patients who were older than 50 years old and were hospitalized for less than 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate of only 12.7% (p = 0.0009). No association was found between C. difficile carriage and chemotherapy regimen, antibiotic drug use, or immunosuppressive mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), or interleukin-10 (IL-10). Twelve ribotypes of C. difficile were identified, but none of them belonged to ribotype 027. Conclusions: We conclude that younger patients and those with longer hospitalization stays may be more prone to C. difficile carriage. Studies of larger populations are warranted to clarify the exact role of C. difficile carriage in hospitalized cancer patients in China.",

No association was found between the C. difficile-positive rate and clinical factors, including collection time, sex, diagnosis, PPI use, chemotherapy regimen and gastroenterological surgery within the last 3 months, and antibiotic drug use within the last 3 months.",

The overall C. difficilepositive rate of the cancer patients enrolled in the 7-month period was 20.5%. This rate is much higher than that (12.6%) reported in non-cancer patients in a similar study in 2009 in eastern China [14] . The relationship between various clinical and immunological factors and C. difficile carriage was further analyzed. Two factors (age, days of hospitalization) were determined to be significantly associated with the rate of C. difficile carriage. First, we found that cancer patients with C. difficile carriage appeared to be younger than patients from the U.S. [15] . This difference could be caused by various factors, such as diet, geographical location, intake of food supplements and drugs, and other causes. Studies also have found that features of gut microbiomes are always unique to different locations and lifestyles [16] . The lifestyles of Chinese people, especially those of young Chinese, have changed dramatically over the last 20 years, partially because of the rapid growth of the Chinese economy. The changed lifestyle which was not so common in China in the past, might be a major contributor to the increasing emergence of C. difficile infection. Interestingly, the age predisposition was consistent with a previous study of cancer patients in Beijing, China [17] . Meanwhile, a large scale study in Japan also revealed that long hospital stay was associated with C. difficile infection [18] . However, these two studies did not provide a cutoff value for age and the hospitalization days. In our study, we found that the cancer patients who were younger than 50 years old and had stayed in hospital for more than 10 days were more prone to C. difficile carriage. It is easier to understand that longer stay in hospital exposes a higher risk of infection to patients; it is less clear to us why the younger patients in our study were more prone to C. difficile carriage. A similar result was reported recently in northern China [17] . Immune response is important for C. difficile carriage. However, among white blood cell count, albumin count, and levels of PGE2, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10, which are thought to be inhibitors of immunological activity [19] , we found no factor was related to the C. difficile-positive rate. And ribotyping of C. difficile showed that there was no 027 strain, which was the major cause of the deadly C. difficile infection emergence in Canada between 2002 and 2005 [20] .",
