While international Arctic collaboration on health has enhanced partnerships and advanced the health of inhabitants, significant challenges lie ahead. One Health is an approach that considers the connections between the environment, plant, animal and human health. Understanding this is increasingly critical in assessing the impact of global climate change on the health of Arctic inhabitants. The effects of climate change are complex and difficult to predict with certainty. Health risks include changes in the distribution of infectious disease, expansion of zoonotic diseases and vectors, changing migration patterns, impacts on food security and changes in water availability and quality, among others. A regional network of diverse stakeholder and transdisciplinary specialists from circumpolar nations and Indigenous groups can advance the understanding of complex climate-driven health risks and provide community-based strategies for early identification, prevention and adaption of health risks in human, animals and environment. We propose a regional One Health approach for assessing interactions at the Arctic human\u00c1animal\u00c1environment interface to enhance the understanding of, and response to, the complexities of climate change on the health of the Arctic inhabitants.",

Understanding the health risks of climate change in the Arctic will require scientists, policy makers, communities and public health experts to collaborate beyond the confines of their disciplines and borders, and One Health provides an approach to detect the emergence of climate-sensitive health threats in the region.

The countries of this region include Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (specifically, Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. The region is home to diverse environments and populations of plants, animals and people living in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet. The physical and biological environments are diverse and include temperate rainforest, boreal forest, tundra, polar desert and cold oceans. There are approximately 10 million human inhabitants in the region that are ethnically diverse with dozens of Indigenous groups (1) . Many of these people still have traditional subsistence economies based upon gathering wild plants, hunting fishing and herding of reindeer (2, 3) .",

However, as the Arctic warms and the lands and ice thaw, the region is increasingly fragile. Arctic temperatures have risen at twice the rate of other parts of the world resulting in decreased sea ice, coastal erosion, changes in precipitation magnitude and frequency, permafrost thawing and altered distribution of plant and animal species (4) . The associated health risks for humans and animals include potential changes in pathogen and vector demographics affecting disease patterns; degradation of drinking water quality and availability, food quality and availability, and changes in animal and plant species health, among others (5\u00c17). Rapid change and recognition of the emerging health threats have resulted in a concerted effort to enhance regional and international partnerships to share best practices in disease surveillance and prevention strategies (8, 9) . Understanding the evolving health threats and anticipating and managing risks influenced by the dynamic impacts of climate change in the Arctic will require innovative science, novel tools and even greater integration of efforts. The implications of health risks \u00c1 to Arctic populations and those beyond \u00c1 calls for broad and diverse stakeholder collaborations to advance the fundamental understanding of emerging health threats, and the development of shared initiatives that decrease vulnerabilities of human and animal communities and the environment. An integrated and holistic approach will be essential for providing the evidence of links between climate change and health risks to support sound policy development.",

            "text": "One Health is not new, though it has gained significant attention over the past decade. An integrated approach to animal, human and environmental health issues can be traced to ancient times. The concept of One Health in the modern age evolved from the theory of One Medicine developed by Sir William Osler in the late 1800s and further elaborated by Calvin Schwabe in the 1970s (13, 14) . Recent attention to One Health can, in part, be attributed to acknowledgement of complex health-related issues associated with rapidly growing populations, increasing speed and magnitude of human travel and migrations, environmental degradation, and disturbance, societal instability and climate change. Visible effects of these forces are expansion, range shift and new emergence of animal, plant and human diseases (15, 16) . The vast majority of emerging disease outbreaks over the past 30 years have been due to zoonotic or vector-borne disease. These health risks are evident in the emergence, re-emergence and/or global spread over the past decade of a wide range of infectious diseases: Hanta virus, Ebola, H1N1 influenza (which reached pandemic levels in 2009), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1), West Nile virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, norovirus, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Marburg, E. coli O157:H7, Yersinia pestis (Plague) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) (17) . While animal health, human health and environmental health are intricately linked, our approach to understand these health risks are mostly independent. The needed collaboration and communication across and between scientific disciplines has been lacking or non-existent. One Health advances a sustained partnership across disciplines and has demonstrated accomplishments in understanding complex health risks (see www.onehealthinitiative.com/ and www.cdc.gov/ onehealth/in-action/index.html). Further, by focusing on the interface of humans, animal and the environment, One Health can help predict outbreaks of disease through a more in-depth understanding of the development and transmission of diseases.",

There is a strong history of local, national, regional and international cooperation among diverse stakeholders in addressing human, animal and environmental health issues (19, 20) . Second, One Health can enhance the exchange of information and take into account local and traditional knowledge and participatory communitybased approaches in identifying and responding to health issues. At the core of a One Health approach are those stakeholders in close proximity to the natural environment and include local communities and indigenous peoples. Third, there are on-going programs, systems and networks working in close collaboration that include local and regional government, multidisciplinary science communities, research institutes, academia, non-governmental agencies, the private sector, civil societies, native organizations and other stakeholders (21, 22) . One example of a transdisciplinary organization is the Alaska One Health Group. The One Health Group was formed in 2013 and is hosted by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Arctic Investigations Program. The group participants include professionals in the fields of plant, wildlife and environmental health and management, and public health, among others with representative from Canada, Alaska, and other parts of the United States. They meet quarterly to discuss emerging One Health issues, to consider events that are indicative of environmental and climate change and to provide a forum for identifying areas of common interest and collaboration (see www.anthc.org/chs/ces/ climate/aohg.cfm). The group maintains a current web accessible One Health Map, which provides a visual aide to help track emerging and trending events. The maps include events screened from news reports, selected posts from the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network and additions made by group members. Updates on trending events are also provided and presentations by topic experts. Trending topics have included important food security events such as increases in toxicity and frequency of harmful algal blooms and die-offs of fish, sea mammals and birds.",

Two working groups under the Artic Council focussing on human health include the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program and the Sustainable Development Working Group formed in 1991 and 1998, respectively (9) . In 2010, the Arctic Council established the Arctic Human Health Expert Group (AHHEG) to more fully integrate the assessment of human health risks with environmental issues (27) . The Charter of the AHHEG is to advance collaboration between all stakeholders on integrated efforts to attendant human health issues with knowledge gained through environmental and community-based research. In 2011, the Health Ministries of the Arctic States issued the Nuuk Declaration, which describes the prioritized areas of concern and actions on health issues and specifically identifies circumpolar cooperation on assessing climate change impacts on health (28) . Also in 2011, the Arctic Council established the International Circumpolar Surveillance Climate Change and Infectious Disease Group to strengthen the integration of animal and human health systems to minimize disease emergence in the Arctic (18, 29, 30) .",

Paradigm shifts are not easy. Assessments of the adoption of the One Health approach have concluded that while the concept and principles have been broadly accepted and endorsed, operationalizing has been more challenging (17, 31) . These challenges include poorly defined unifying One Health efforts, a lack of One Health champions and partners, limited resource and policy hurdles, among others. However, calls for guidance on how to move beyond concept has resulted in recommendations and roadmaps outlining steps, programme metrics and programme assessments to operationalize One Health (32, 33) . An implementing strategy for Arctic One Health approach will benefit from using one of the recently developed One Health operationalizing ''road maps.'' Two examples include the work done by the University of Minnesota and US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Andrea Meisser and Anne Levy Goldblum (34, 35) . Developing a strategy with process steps, progress measures and well-defined milestones will be crucial in obtaining broad-based support for a regional One Health effort. The implementation strategy process can, and should, assess vulnerabilities, evaluate alternative strategies and programmes for health risks identification and assessments, assess the costs and benefits of those various options and promote their adoption and/or adaptation. Tools for moving this strategy forward are described below.",
