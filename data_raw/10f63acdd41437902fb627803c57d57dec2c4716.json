Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a family of zoonotic viruses with wide variety of animal hosts, including birds and humans. The infections caused by coronaviruses vary from mild to severe, depending on the viral species and the host. Since the coronaviruses exhibit extraordinary large RNA genome, also the rate of homologous recombination is high, which in turn contributes to the genetic diversity and interspecies host-switches of CoVs. The emergence of novel CoVs has been rich during the last decades, and wild birds seem to serve as reservoirs for a variety of CoV strains. We examined the CoVs circulating among wild birds in Finland. Materials and methods: Samples (cloacal swab, tracheal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or tissue) representing 61 bird species were collected during 2010-2013, and examined by RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene for the presence of CoV RNA. Results: Altogether 51/939 (5.4%) of the examined birds were found positive by RT-PCR. Diverse gamma-and deltacoronavirus sequences were detected. Discussion: Gamma-and deltacoronaviruses circulate among wild birds in Finland. The number of CoV-positive birds detected each year varies greatly.",

The course of infection varies greatly from asymptomatic to severe disease, depending on the host and virus species in question. The genome of CoVs is one of the largest (25-32 kb) viral RNA-genomes [1] . Based on phylogenetic analysis, the CoVs are divided into four different genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. The alpha-and betacoronaviruses are carried by mammals, whereas the gamma-and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds, with few exceptions [2, 3] . The large genomes, infidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination are the main factors contributing to the high genetic diversity of CoVs [4] [5] [6] .",

The emergence of SARS-CoV [16] inspired virologists to more explore the highly divergent group of coronaviruses and their hosts, leading to the identification of a rapidly growing number of CoV species particularly in bats [2] . More recently, another highly pathogenic betaCoV infecting humans, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV emerged in 2012 with a case fatality rate of over 40% [17, 18] .",

Altogether 939 samples collected between 2010 and 2013 from wild birds were included in the study. The prevalence was fairly high (up to 11%) although with great annual variation. The sample panels differed to some extent in terms of time and geographic distribution ( Figure 2 ) and sampled species, which might partly explain the annual variation. For example, majority of the samples of 2010 were from duck species (Anas sp.) sampled for active surveillance purposes. In 2011-2013 on the contrary, most samples were derived through passive surveillance and included a smaller proportion of ducks. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn whether the observed difference in prevalence is due to some regular pattern, or due to the sampling methods (heterogeneity of the sample material).",

Similar double infections have been reported by other researchers [35] , and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) together with type-1 avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) are also commonly detected [36] . The coinfections observed here were in four apparently healthy ducks, three mallards and a teal, suggesting that infections by a number of low virulence viruses are well tolerated by migratory ducks. CoV infections in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) have been documented in Sweden [26, 35] , and one of the studies reported the prevalence of CoV infections to be 6.9% albeit with seasonal variation [35] . In a more recent study, Wille et al. documented the prevalence of CoVs among wild waterbirds in Sweden to be even 18.7% [37] . A study from Norway reported the prevalence of CoV RNA among graylag goose (Anser anser) in Northern Europe to be as high as 38% in 2004, but they also documented great annual and geographical variation; in 2003 the prevalence was only 18% [38] . Also in England, wildfowl (Anseriformes) and waders (Charadriiformes) have been reported to carry CoVs [39] . A report from South Korea documented a prevalence of CoV RNA to be 0.95% in wildfowl (Anseriformes), and they also observed annual variation in the detection of CoV RNA Table 2 , and are here illustrated by numbers on a map of Finland. [34] . Based on the studies from South Korea [34] and Northern Europe [38] , and the results we obtained, it seems that large annual variation in the circulating RNA seems to be characteristic to avian coronaviruses. A study in China reported Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus RNA in 12% of the screened, apparently healthy, wild aquatic birds (Anseriformes, Pelecaniformes, and Ciconiiformes) [24] , which is in concordance with our results. Another study, conducted in the Beringia area (encompassing areas of Alaska and Siberia), reported Gammacoronavirus RNA in 6.4% of the examined birds (Anseriformes, Pelecaniformes, and Charadriiformes) [23] . Interestingly, some of the sequences found in the Chinese study [24] were identical to those found from the Beringia area [23] . Also the Finnish Duck CoVs reported in this study cluster very closely with duck CoVs of the Gammacoronavirus genus from Siberia and China, which are connected by migratory routes. The close genetic relatedness of these strains (as well as those found in South Korea and England) indicates that migratory birds do have a specific role in dispersing CoV to distinct geographical locations. However, the sequence analyses might be somewhat biased due Figure 2 . Maximum likelihood phylogeny of avian coronaviruses detected in Finland in wild birds. A 464 nucleotide long sequence region of the RdRp gene within Orf1ab was sequenced and aligned with reference sequences: the analysis includes alignments of 46 viruses detected in this study and a diverse set of reference strains obtained through BLAST search. Maximumlikelihood analysis using 1000 bootstrap replicates was used to infer tree topology. The evolutionary model GTR+G + I was used after evaluation of the best-fit model according to Bayesian Information Criterion. Bootstrap support values exceeding 70 are shown next to the nodes. Strains described in this study are marked by dots. Branches have been collapsed where our viruses share high sequence identity, and the branch wideness is relative to the number of viruses included.",

Also, the fact that we detected a Deltacoronavirus in Chroicocephalus ridibundus is interesting, since in another study [23] Gammacoronavirus RNA was found from the same bird species. It was previously reported, that the bird species from the order Anseriformes can be infected with both delta-and gammacoronaviruses [24] , and we now demonstrate that the same applies for the order Charadriiformes. The abundance of the detected CoV sequences originated from ducks supports the hypothesis that the Duck CoVs would persist as endemic in duck populations causing subclinical infections similarly to LPAI and APMV.",

In addition, we show that the number of CoV-positive birds detected each year varies greatly. Due to the high recombination rate of CoVs, new species constantly arise that are able to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches [5] . Since the number of CoV sequences detected from birds was so abundant, it would be interesting to study what types of CoVs are circulating in small Finnish mammals, especially those in close contact with birds.",
