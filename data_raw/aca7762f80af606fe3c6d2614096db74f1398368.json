            "text": "The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies. After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids 224 HWPKPHTLW 232 , was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.",

            "text": "Dengue infection, commonly called bone breaker illness, is mosquito (Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus) borne. This disease ranges across tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, especially in Asian and Latin American countries. The global incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold in recent decades. It was recently estimated that 50-100 million dengue infections occur each year and almost half of the world's population lives in countries where dengue is endemic [1] [2] . DENV belongs to the Flaviviridae family with four distinct serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4). Infection with any of these serotypes causes clinical symptoms including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Due to the absence of a suitable vaccine, effective, early and rapid diagnosis against all serotypes of DENV is of significance to reduce the morbidity and mortality of DHF and DSS, especially in developing countries [3] [4] . DENV contains a single open reading frame of approximately 11 kb with three structural (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [5] . NS1 is one of the most important nonstructural glycoproteins (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) and is considered to be immunogenic either secreted as a soluble hexamer form or as a membrane-associated protein on DENV infected cells [6] [7] . NS1 represents an interesting target antigen for diagnosis due to its presence in the blood of infected patients mostly from days 1-6 after the onset of clinical symptoms and in significant amounts from days 6-10 in both primary and secondary infection [8] [9] .",

Many methods have been explored and used to diagnose dengue infection, including virus isolation [10] , viral RNA direct detection [4] , virusspecific IgM antibody detection [11] , antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays [12] [13] and immunochromatographic assays [14] . Among these methods, the gold nanoparticlebased immunochromatographic assay has drawn much attention as a promising tool for the development of a biosensor for early and rapid detection of the disease. Usually, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are used for immunochromatographic assays [14] [15] [16] . Although there are many advantages of MAbs in biomedical research, there are also several limitations, such as the long time period and effort required, especially in the cloning and selection process, to obtain a successful monoclonal antibody.",

The four VHHs were analyzed for CDR and framework regions according to the IMGT unique numbering system [30] (http://www.imgt.org/3Dstructure-DB/ cgi/DomainGapAlign.cgi). These VHHs have 82-87% nucleotide identity with Lama glama (IGHV1S3*01 and IGHJ4*01). P2 and P10 clones have nine unique nucleotides whereas P9 and P13 clones have 12 unique nucleotides in the CDR3 regions ( Figure 3 ) (GenBank accession number: KF193086-KF193089). The long CDR3 regions indicate that those VHHs may have good binding affinity with antigen [31] [32] .",

For this recombinant NS1 protein of dengue type 2, 4.5 ng/ml and 9 ng/ml detection limits were observed visually for the VHH antibody (P2) immobilized kit and monoclonal antibody (3B3) immobilized kit, respectively. The test lines for every concentration of antigen in the VHH antibody immobilized strips were a little darker than those in the monoclonal antibody immobilized strips ( Figure 6 ). To evaluate the sensitivity, inactivated viral culture supernatant of dengue type 2 containing native NS1 was used because dengue type 2 positive blood samples were not available from any hospital in Guangzhou, China. This viral culture supernatant was diluted in ratios of 1:10, 1:20, 1:100, 1:150 and 1:200 in 0.85% NaCl and tested on both types of strips. A parallel experiment was performed with commercially available SD Bioline Dengue Duo (NS1/IgM/ IgG) kits (Kyonggi-do, Korea) to compare and check the accuracy of diagnosis of the kits prepared in the present study. The color intensity of the T line was compared with a standard color test card developed by Wondfo (Guangzhou, China). Strong detection levels based on the color of the T line were observed for dilutions 1:10 and 1:20, but the level gradually became weaker for other dilutions ( Table 2 ). The VHH immobilized strips displayed higher sensitivity with the appearance of darker colored T lines for each dilution as compared to the monoclonal antibody immobilized strips and the commercial kit. The native NS1 detection level of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit prepared in the present study was consistent with that of the commercial kit. The end point dilution/limit dilution of detectable NS1 in the viral culture supernatant was 1:150 for the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit and the commercial kit. But for the VHH antibody immobilized kit, the end point dilution was 1:200. The color of the T line was weak and difficult to identify at the limit of dilution. The sensitivity indicated that the performances of both kits prepared in the present study were accurate. Thus, VHH antibody immobilized kit exhibited a higher sensitivity with a 1:200 dilution limit as compared with our monoclonal antibody immobilized kit and the commercial kit with dilution limits of 1:150.",

The phage clones were isolated by incubating the 12-mer linear random peptide library with the monoclonal antibody (3B3) and VHH antibody (P2) after three rounds of bioscreening. For the two antibodies, a total of 20 phage clones were picked. The inserted DNA fragments of the selected phage clones comprised 36 nucleotides and were translated to 12 amino acid residues. The peptide sequences of the epitopes and the rNS1 protein sequence of DENV2 were aligned and their homology compared. Sequence analysis revealed several different binding epitopes on rNS1 protein identified by all clones but the C-terminal region of amino acids 224-232 was found to be homologous for all clones. For the VHH antibody (P2), seven independent phage clones were obtained after biopanning of the 12-mer library. Among them, ten clones (designated as V1) had the same peptide sequence WHWSYWPGDNRA and another five clones (designated as V2) had the same peptide sequence FHWSWSMQSAAT.

Currently, the frequency of dengue infection has increased because of warmer weather conditions and frequent international travel. On the other hand, few NS1 antigen-based commercial diagnostic kits are available [9, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Most of these kits are dependent on conventional monoclonal antibodies. In the current study, the discovery of single domain, small-sized (15-16 kDa) and more versatile VHH antibodies with long CDR3 regions offers the potential for the development of a more advanced biosensor.",

P2 VHH antibody was selected due to its higher K D value (2.79610 -8 M) and successful pairing as a capture antibody with 3 M4 detection antibody for the development of a rapid diagnostic kit. The detection limit of the VHH antibody immobilized kit using recombinant NS1 antigen was lower (4.5 ng/ml) than that of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit (9 ng/ml) ( Figure 6 ). Previously, it has been reported that the concentration of circulating NS1 in acute phase serum samples ranges from 10 ng/ml to 50 mg/ml [8] . The present analytical sensitivity indicates that both kinds of kits are suitable for the detection of low concentrations of NS1 in DENV2 infections. Our findings are supported by some recent studies in which the analytical sensitivities of dengue early rapid tests [14] and NS1 antigen capture ELISA [13] based on monoclonal antibodies were found to be less than 5 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml, respectively, when purified recombinant NS1 was used.",

The sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was consistent with that of the commercial kit with a 1:150 dilution limit for the detection of native NS1 in DENV2 culture supernatant whereas the VHH immobilized kit displayed a higher sensitivity with a 1:200 dilution limit. The specificities of the two kits prepared in the present study were also compared with the commercial kit. The specificity of VHH antibody immobilized kit was higher (99.50%) than that of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit (95.24%) and the commercial kit (98.04%). This comparison study of VHH and monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kits with the commercial kit revealed that kits developed in the present study are reliable and fast. Because of the high target specificity, affinity and ease of production of VHH antibody, the rapid diagnostic kit based on VHH antibody was found to be more efficient and economical and it displayed better sensitivity and specificity results compared to the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit.",

            "text": "Epitope mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of immune responses and diagnostics [49] . Identification of the epitopes requires the preparation of highly specific antibodies. After the successful generation of MAb and VHH antibodies against DENV2-rNS1, the antigenic epitopes were identified by biopanning of a commercially available phage display peptide library (Ph.D 12 kit) using P2 and 3B3 antibodies as targets. After three rounds of panning, phage clones capable of binding to both antibodies were enriched, showing an increase in titer in the case of the VHH antibody compared to the monoclonal antibody. Sequence analysis revealed that there was only one rNS1 epitope residue (corresponding to residues 224-232), which was identical for all clones in both kinds of antibodies. The two peptide sequences WHWSYWPGDNRA (same in V1 and M1 clones) and FHWSWSMQSAAT (same in V2 and M2 clones) were predicted to be the mimotopes on rNS1. The homologous region of the rNS1 sequence (aa224-232) was assessed as a potential epitope for both kinds of antibodies, which indicates that histidine and tryptophan are probably key components in almost all of the clones and form the antigenic epitope ( Figure 7A, 7B) . These amino acids may play an important role in antibody binding. Similarly, Wu et al. [50] [51] used serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies to identify the epitopes of DENV1-NS1 and DENV2-NS1 from a random peptide library displayed on a phage. They also found that histidine was the most important amino acid for antibody binding. In consequence, this study revealed that the rNS1 epitope residues 224 HWPKPHTLW 232 in the C-terminus epitope region are conserved for both monoclonal and VHH antibodies with similar antigenic epitopes.",

            "text": "In conclusion, selection of VHH against DENV2-rNS1 from a non-immune llama library by a phage display technique proved to be very successful within 4 weeks. Furthermore, VHH expression from E. coli and purification within 1 week holds great promise for future large scale production in a cost-effective way. Compared to hybridoma technology, this protocol requires less time and no animal immunization. Selection and screening of positive VHH clones are also accurate and fast. Thus, extensive isolation and production of single domain antibodies become affordable. The comparison of monoclonal and VHH antibodies for the identification and screening of NS1 epitopes may provide better information for developing serological tests. Both kinds of antibodies have similar NS1 epitopes that might be involved in the diagnosis of DENV2 infections. There is no big difference between the sensitivity and specificity of VHH and monoclonal antibody immobilized kits, but better visible results with the VHH antibody immobilized kit indicate that VHHs are more versatile and suitable for binding the pocket or cleft of targeted antigens due to their long CDR3 regions as compared to monoclonal antibodies. All of these findings indicate that VHH offers similar or better results than conventional monoclonal antibody. Therefore, VHH antibodies offer a promising alternative for developing commercial diagnostic tools. One limitation of the present study is the unavailability of DENV2 positive serum samples from hospitals. Further work is still needed to determine the sensitivity of the rapid diagnostic kits with a large number of dengue positive serum samples collected at different times in the course of infection.
