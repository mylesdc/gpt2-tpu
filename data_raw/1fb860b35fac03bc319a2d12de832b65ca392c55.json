The epitopes and mechanisms of mAbs targeting non-RBD regions have not been well characterized yet. Here we report the monoclonal antibody 7D10 that binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike glycoprotein and inhibits the cell entry of MERS-CoV with high potency. Structure determination and mutagenesis experiments reveal the epitope and critical residues on the NTD for 7D10 binding and neutralization. Further experiments indicate that the neutralization by 7D10 is not solely dependent on the inhibition of DPP4 binding, but also acts after viral cell attachment, inhibiting the pre-fusion to post-fusion conformational change of the spike. These properties give 7D10 a wide neutralization breadth and help explain its synergistic effects with several RBD-targeting antibodies. 1 1234567890():,;",

Infection by this pathogen causes an acute respiratory disease designated as MERS, with symptoms that are very similar to those of SARS 2 . Globally, MERS-CoV infections have been confirmed in 27 countries causing 803 deaths (http://www.who. int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Interspecies transmission from dromedary camels to humans is considered to be one major route of transmission in the Middle East region 3, 4 . However, many infected patients without camel exposure and a recent MERS outbreak in Korea demonstrated that large-scale human-tohuman transmissions can occur through close contacts 5 . Due to its potential for mutating toward efficient human-to-human transmission and causing a pandemic, MERS-CoV was listed as a Category C Priority Pathogen by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",

On coronaviruses, the component primarily targeted by mAbs is the homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of the virion. As a typical class I fusion glycoprotein, the S trimer of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion during viral entry [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , undergoes protease cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits, positional change of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit for receptor binding, dissociation of the S1-receptor complex, and finally formation of a six-helix bundle by the S2 subunits. A series of RBD-targeting antibodies against MERS-CoV, which block the binding of the S trimer to the cellular receptor DPP4, have been reported and characterized [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These antibodies exhibited high potency in inhibiting the infectivity of pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV in cells and animal models. The neutralizing epitopes and mechanisms of antibodies including 4C2, D12, m336, MERS-27, JC57-14, CDC-C2, MERS-4, and MERS-GD27 were further elucidated at the atomic level by structural and functional studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

The 7D10 antibody recognizes the NTD of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and neutralizes the infectivity of pseudotyped and live virus with a potency comparable to those of the most active RBD-targeting antibodies. We also found that the epitope and mechanism of 7D10, which are different from those of RBDtargeting antibodies, enable it to have a better neutralizing breadth and to work synergistically with other antibodies against different MERS-CoV strains.

To generate MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs with epitopes outside the RBD, mice were immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S protein (residues 1-1297). Subsequently, the spleenocytes were harvested and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells, and the hybridoma cell lines were screened for positive clones by ELISA with the S protein 27 . The positive clones were further tested for their reactivity to different S fragments, including the S1 subunit NTD (residues 18-353), RBD (residues 367-606), and the S2 subunit (residues 726-1297). One NTD-specific mAb, named as 7D10, was finally isolated with an EC 50 of approximately 0.31 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in ELISA (Fig. 1a) . It exhibited no crossreactivity with the RBD at a concentration of 4 \u03bcg mL \u22121 (Fig. 1b) . We further assessed the potential of 7D10, in the form of crude extracts from mouse ascites, for inhibiting MERS-CoV entry into susceptible Huh7 cells and Vero E6 cells with either pseudotyped or infectious viruses. As expected, 7D10 was able to neutralize the infectivity of pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV (Fig. 1c, d) . The neutralizing activity of 7D10 was dose-dependent, with an IC 50 of approximately 0.18 \u03bcg mL \u22121 against pseudotyped virus and practically the same IC 50 of approximately 0.2 \u03bcg mL \u22121 against live virus (EMC strain) (Fig. 1c, d) . Images illustrating the reduced PFU formation, corresponding to the rate of neutralization of live MERS-CoV, are shown in Fig. 1e . Antibody isotyping showed that 7D10 belongs to the IgG1 subtype. Sequencing further determined that the heavy chain germline V and J segments are IGHV1-12*01 and IGHJ2*03, while those of light chain are IGKV03-12*01, IGKJ1*01, and IGKJ1*02, respectively (Supplementary Table 1) .",

Statistics of diffraction data collection, processing, and structure refinement are listed in Table 2 . There were three complexes of 7D10-scFv bound to NTD per asymmetric unit. The refined model contains residues Tyr18 to Ser353 of MERS-CoV NTD, Glu1 to Ser120 of the V H and Asp26 to Lys136 of the V L . N-linked glycans attached to Asn66, Asn104, Asn125, Asn155, Asn166, Asn222, Asn236, and Asn244 of the NTD are also included in the model. It has been previously shown that the MERS-CoV NTD folds into a galectin-like structure, which can be separated into top, core and bottom subdomains (Fig. 2a) . Upon binding, the 7D10-scFv contacts the top subdomain of the NTD and the Asn222-linked glycans with its heavy and light chains ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2 ).

To confirm the epitope and its critical residues, we performed a mutagenesis study by introducing single mutations to all 13 NTD recognized residues including Trp18, Asp20, Pro23, Asp24, Val26, Ser28, Glu188, Ser191, Asn222, Asn226, Lue234, Arg235, and Asn236. We first examined the effects of these NTD mutations on the binding by 7D10-H. The 7D10-H bound the wild-type NTD with an affinity of approximately 25 nM (Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). By contrast, the D24A and R235A mutations dramatically reduced the binding, to a level that was undetectable by BLI experiment (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The E188A and N222Q mutations reduced by the binding affinity by 148-fold to 3.7 \u03bcM and 112-fold to 2.8 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). All the other nine mutations had variant unequal effects on the binding by reducing the affinity in the range of 2-to 15-fold (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The effects of these mutations on the neutralizing activity of 7D10-H were in consistent with the changes of binding affinity. Pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing D24A, E188A, or R235A mutation in the spike glycoprotein escaped the neutralization by 7D10-H (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The IC 50 values of 7D10 against pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing D20A, V26A, or N222Q mutation were increased approximately by 60-, 181-, and 50-fold (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The binding and neutralization assays collectively revealed that Asp24, Val26, Glu188, Arg235, and Asn222-linked glycans are critical for recognition and neutralization of MERS-CoV by 7D10.",

Alignments of the deposited sequences in the NCBI identified 22 naturally changing residues from the prototype EMC sequence including V26F, V26I, V26A, D158Y, L411F, T424I, A482Y, L506F, D509G, V530L, V534A, E536K, D537E, V810I, Q833R, Q914H, R1020H, R1020Q, A1193S, T1202I, G1224S, and V1314A, which are located in the NTD (residues 18-353) and RBD (residues 367-606) of the S1 subunit, and the S2 subunit (residues 752-1297). Several residue changes on the RBD, such as those occurring on D506, D509, and E536, indeed enabled the MERS-CoV to escape the neutralization of antibodies targeting the RBD 20, 21 . Considering that most of the mutations are outside the NTD, we speculated that 7D10-H would have a better tolerance for these naturally occurring mutations. We generated pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing the EMC strain S glycoproteins and its mutants harboring all the 22 listed residue changes. The neutralization assays showed that 7D10-H showed effective neutralizing activity against almost all pseudotyped MERS-CoV variants. Only the two mutations V26F and V26A on the NTD increased the IC 50 value of 7D10-H by more than 150-fold and significantly reduced its neutralization activity (Fig. 3a, b) , which confirmed the results of the structural and biochemical studies of the binding interface. All other naturally occurring mutations, most of them on the RBD and the S2 subunit did not affect the neutralization capability of 7D10-H (Fig. 3a, b) , indicating that 7D10 would have a wide neutralization breadth against different variants of MERS-CoV.",

The current available MERS-CoV antibody epitopes with solved structures are all on the RBD, which can be grouped into three categories: (1) epitope of MERS-4; (2) epitopes of MERS-27, D12, 4C2, and JC57-14; and (3) epitopes of m336, MCA1, CDC-C2, and the newly reported MERS-GD27 ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) 25 . In our study of the RBD-specific mAb MERS-4, we also found synergism with the NTD-targeting mAb 5F9 25 . Thus, the elucidation of the epitope targeted by 7D10, which added a category outside the RBD ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ), prompted us to study the combined effect of 7D10 together with the three representative antibodies MERS-4, MERS-27, and MERS-GD27 in the neutralization of pseudotyped MERS-CoV by titrating the neutralizing potency of an equimolar mixture of the two antibodies and comparing the dose response with that observed in neutralization assays performed with the individual antibody alone. As shown in the Fig. 4 , the combination index (CI) values of MERS-GD27 combined with 7D10 at FA values of effective dose 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED 50 , ED 75 , ED 90 , and ED 95 , respectively) were 0.26, 0.25, 0.24, and 0.24, respectively. As a CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect, <1 indicates synergism, and >1 indicates antagonism, the combination of 7D10 and MERS-GD27 worked in a clearly synergistic manner. Meanwhile, the combination index (CI) values of combined MERS-4 with 7D10 at FA values of effective dose 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED 50 , ED 75 , ED 90 , and ED 95 ) were 0.25, 0.27, 0.30, and 0.33, respectively. Thus, the combination of MERS-4 and 7D10 also demonstrated synergism, in particular at relatively lower concentrations. However, the percent neutralization obtained using combined MERS-27 and 7D10 showed no obvious difference of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) compared with that of 7D10 alone. The combination index (CI) values of combined MERS-27 and 7D10 at FA values of effective dose 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED 50 , ED 75 , ED 90 , and ED 95 ) were 0.82, 0.87, 0.94, and 1.00, respectively.

The epitopes of these reported antibodies all reside in the RBD responsible for receptor binding. The fact that the 7D10 epitope is outside the RBD indicated that it may have a different neutralizing mechanism. We first examined if 7D10 is still able to inhibit the receptor binding by the S trimer. The FACS analysis of cellsurface staining showed that the scFv and Fab fragments of 7D10-H did not inhibit the staining of Huh7 cells by the S trimer, while the 7D10-H slightly reduced the staining (Fig. 5a , Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). By contrast, the RBDtargeting mAb MERS-4 was much more potent than 7D10-H in inhibiting the binding of the S trimer to Huh7 cells. Moreover, the Fab and scFv fragments of MERS-4 retained nearly the same potency in the inhibition ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 4 ). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis confirmed these conclusions by showing that 7D10-H, and not its Fab or scFv fragments, could interfere with the binding of the S trimer to chipcoupled DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner ( Supplementary  Fig. 7) , while the IgG, Fab, and scFv of MERS-4 all inhibited the binding ( Supplementary Fig. 7) .",

The MERS-CoV S trimer structure was determined by cryo-EM with the RBD in standing or lying positions, and only the standing RBD could bind to the DPP4 receptor. After superimposing the NTD/7D10-scFv crystal structure onto the S trimer, we observed no steric clashes between three NTD-bound scFv fragments and one or two RBDbound DPP4 receptors ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The S trimer with three RBD-bound receptors was not considered because the cryo-EM study of the MERS-CoV S trimer only revealed conformations with one or two standing RBDs. When the scFv was replaced with the Fab, there were also no steric clashes between the Fab and DPP4 receptor (Fig. 5c ). It is more complicated to model the binding of 7D10-H to the S trimer, considering that the IgG form has two binding sites and the intrinsic flexibility. We found that binding of the 7D10-H IgG to the NTD in certain orientations could inhibit the binding of DPP4 due to steric clashes, while there were still no steric clashes with the 7D10-H bound in some other orientations (Fig. 5d, e) . These results provided a structural explanation for the inability of 7D10-H scFv and Fab to inhibit the binding of the S trimer to the DPP4 receptor. They may also explain why the 7D10-H IgG form is not as potent as the MERS-4 IgG, Fab, and scFv which all directly bind to the RBD.",

Meanwhile, we analyzed the full-length MERS-CoV S trimer embedded in the membrane of pseudotyped virus and the trigger we used to induce the conformational transition was the incubation with Huh 7 cells that endogenously expressing DPP4 receptor. After incubating the pseudotyped virus with Huh 7 cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, a proteinase-K resistant band on the SDS-PAGE gel appeared and the addition of 7D10-H, 7D10-H Fab, or 7D10 scFv all clearly decreased the intensity of this band ( Supplementary Fig. 10) .

Neutralization assays showed that 7D10 is highly potent and its activity is comparable to that of the most potent RBD-targeting antibodies. Structural determination of 7D10 scFv bound to the NTD and mutagenesis studies revealed the epitope and key residues on the NTD for binding and neutralization at atomic level. Comparisons of 7D10 scFv, Fab, and IgG forms in DPP4-binding competition and neutralization assays indicated that its activity is not solely dependent on the inhibition of DPP4 binding. Further experiments indicated that the neutralizing activity of 7D10 after cell attachment is through the inhibition of prefusion to postfusion conformational transition of the S glycoprotein trimer, which mediates the fusion of viral and cell membranes. We also showed that 7D10 has a wide neutralization breadth against MERS-CoV variants bearing naturally occurring mutations and exhibited synergistic effects with several RBD-targeting antibodies. These results collectively revealed an antibody epitope and neutralization mechanism on the S glycoprotein, which would contribute to the global efforts to control MERS-CoV infection and transmission by providing alternatives for MERS-CoV immunotherapy. Similar the NTDs of the S protein of other betacoronaviruses such as MHV, BCoV and HKU1, that of MERS-CoV also folds into a galectin-like structure. Although the galectin domain is a typical carbohydrate-recognition domain, the betacoronavirus NTDs can include structural variations that enable more diverse functions in viral infection. The examples, include the NTD of BCoV that retains the glycan-binding activity recognizing 5-N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) and the NTD of MHV that evolved specific protein-protein interactions with its cellular receptor CEACAM1, and both interactions are important for the viral cell attachment 36, 37 . However, there is still no report on the glycan or protein-binding activities of the MERS-CoV NTD. In fact, crystallographic structure determination showed that the glycanbinding site on the MERS-CoV NTD is occupied by a short helix (residues 222-231) and the Asn222-linked glycan, indicating that it is not able to bind glycans in the same way as the NTD of BCoV 11 . Notably, the Asn222-linked glycan is involved in the recognition by 7D10, whereby NAG508 and MAN519 undergoes specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with Tyr58 and Arg98 of 7D10, respectively. The NTD N222Q mutation also dramatically reduced the binding and neutralization by 7D10, but did not dramatically affect the cell infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV ( Supplementary  Fig. 11) . Therefore, the Asn222-linked glycan serves as an important anchor point for the binding of 7D10 to the MERS-CoV NTD.",

            "text": "As the largest class I viral fusion protein, the coronavirus S glycoprotein is expected to undergo a prefusion to postfusion conformational transition to mediate the interaction between viral and cellular membrane proteins, although structural studies just began to shed light on this recently. The S glycoprotein of betacoronaviruses MHV and HKU1, whose structures have been determined by the cryo-EM method, all adopt a similar prefusion homotrimeric architecture 38, 39 . Interestingly, in the prefusion architecture of the S trimer of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, two major conformational states were observed. A 7D10-H IgG was tested for neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV before or after receptor binding. VRC01 mAb was used as unrelated control. c The effect of 7D10-H Fab on the conformational change of the MERS-CoV S trimer was probed by western blotting using an anti-MERS-CoV S2 polyclonal antibody. Refolding to the postfusion conformation was detected by the appearance of a proteinase-K resistant band. Trypsin was used at 5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 and proteinase K at 10 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Digestion experiments and western blots were performed in triplicates, and a representative result is shown for each of them. d A cartoon representation designed by us showing the neutralization mechanism by which 7D10 blocks MERS-CoV entry. On the one hand, some virus particles can not bind to DPP4 due to steric hindrance caused by 7D10 binding. On the other hand, 7D10 still recognizes the particles when the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to DPP4, and may inhibit the prefusion to postfusion transition of the S2 subunit and the initiation of membrane fusion. Source data are provided as a Source Data file major difference between them is the change of the RBD in the S1 subunit from a down to an up position, which was proposed to be a prerequisite for the binding of the S trimer to their respective cellular receptor DPP4 and ACE2 9 . This proposal was recently confirmed by our cryo-EM study of the SARS-CoV S trimer in complex with ACE2, and we also showed that ACE2-binding could induce the dissociation of the S1 subunit, which results in the falling apart of the prefusion S trimer and the transition to the prefusion state of the S2 subunit 12 . A major neutralization mechanism of antibodies against MERS-CoV is to directly or indirectly compete with the cellular receptor DPP4 for binding to the RBD. In theory, antibodies that interfere with the coronavirus membrane fusion process other than receptor binding would also have a neutralizing activity, and the 7D10 mAb targeting the NTD we studied is one such example. Here, we showed that 7D10 neutralization is not solely dependent on DPP4-binding competition, and its inhibition of the S trimer conformational transition after cell attachment also plays a significant role in the neutralization. We suggested that the binding of 7D10 may stabilize the prefusion architecture of the S trimer, even after the binding of DPP4 receptor. The stabilization of viral fusion protein at one conformational state for neutralization has also been observed and studied in other viruses such as HIV. A recent study revealed that the HIV Env trimer is intrinsically dynamic with three major and distinct prefusion conformations 40 . Among them, the closed, ground-state conformation is dominant and could be remodeled to another two conformations by CD4 receptor binding, which is essential for the subsequent prefusion to postfusion transition 40 . The binding of neutralizing antibodies, whether inhibiting the binding of the CD4 receptor (such as VRC01) or not (such as 2G12 and PGT145) all resulted in the stabilization of the ground-state conformation of the Env, which finally disfavors its prefusion to postfusion state transition required for viral entry 40, 41 .",

As we summarized in Supplementary Table 5 , a total of six anti-NTD mAbs have been reported 20, 21, 26, 42 . All of them neutralize the infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV EMC strain with high potency except for mAb 1.10f3. The mAb 5F9 and our 7D10 showed the same neutralizing activity against live MERS-CoV in plaque reduction neutralization testing. Notably, the mouse mAb G2 can greatly relieve the symptom of DPP4-transgenic mice infected following MERS-CoV infection and our 7D10-H can inhibit the infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV in R26-hDPP4 mice. However, the specific neutralizing epitopes and mechanisms of 5F9, G2, JC57-13, and FIB-H1 are largely unknown. In addition, the combination of different antibodies is supposed to be an effective strategy to combat MERS-CoV infection as it continues to spread among multiple animal species and to probe and adapt to the human population [43] [44] [45] . An effective combination would require the candidate antibodies to bind to disparate epitopes or with distinct mechanisms and hence display additive or synergistic effects, as the mAbs MERS-4 and 5F9 we mentioned before 25 . Although the exact mechanism that leads to the synergy or additive is uncertain, our 7D10-H with MERS-GD27 or MERS-4 antibodies demonstrated a synergy in inhibiting the infectivity of pseudotyped MERS-CoV, while 7D10-H and MERS-27 antibodies together had an additive effect. Consequently, 7D10 is currently the most comprehensively studied NTD-targeting mAb with a different epitope and working mechanism, which makes it an excellent candidate, in combination with other RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies or alone, in our battle against MERS-CoV infection. Three weeks after the initial immunization, these mice were boosted twice at 2-week intervals. Cells collected from the spleens of sacrificed animals were fused with cultured SP2/0 cells at a 10:1 ratio in the presence of PEG1450 (Sigma). HAT selection medium was used for the fused hybridoma cultures. After 2-weeks of incubation, the positive hybridomas were selected via S-coated ELISA, and the positive clones were subjected to limited dilutions and downstream validation. For large-scale mAb production, ascites fluid from mice inoculated with the hybridomas was collected and purified by the caprylic acid-ammonium sulfate precipitation method.",

Soluble MERS-CoV spike trimer (S) with strep-tag (1 \u03bcg) was incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in advance at a molar ratio 1:1, 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27 for 1 h. Huh7 cells were incubated with S or S and mAbs mixtures for 1 h. After washing the unbound S, Huh7 cells were stained with streptavidin APC and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The amounts of S-bound Huh-7 cells were measured and characterized as median fluorescence intensity. See also SupplementaryTable 4andSupplementary Fig. 6. b-e Top view and side view of the MERS-CoV spike trimer in receptor-binding activated states (PDB: 5 \u00d7 5c [https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb5X5C/pdb]) with two RBD in the up positions, on which the RBD/DPP4 and NTD/antibody structures are superimposed. The spike trimer (RBD in green, NTD in blue, and S2 subunit in gray) was shown as a cartoon. The DPP4 was shown as a semitransparent surface and colored in yellow. 7D10-scFv (b), 7D10-Fab (c), and 7D10-IgG (d, e) were all colored pink. 7D10-Fab and 7D10-IgG were modeled using homologous modeling in SWISS-MODEL",
