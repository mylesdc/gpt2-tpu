            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) induces severe aggravating respiratory failure in infected patients, frequently resulting in mechanical ventilation. As limited therapeutic antibody is accumulated in lung tissue following systemic administration, inhalation is newly recognized as an alternative, possibly better, route of therapeutic antibody for pulmonary diseases. The nebulization process, however, generates diverse physiological stresses, and thus, the therapeutic antibody must be resistant to these stresses, remain stable, and form minimal aggregates. We first isolated a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody that is reactive to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein. To increase stability, we introduced mutations into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody. In the HCDRs (excluding HCDR3) in this clone, two hydrophobic residues were replaced with Glu, two residues were replaced with Asp, and four residues were replaced with positively charged amino acids. In LCDRs, only two Leu residues were replaced with Val. These modifications successfully generated a clone with significantly greater stability and equivalent reactivity and neutralizing activity following nebulization compared to the original clone. In summary, we generated a MERS-CoV neutralizing human antibody that is reactive to recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD protein for delivery via a pulmonary route by introducing stabilizing mutations into five CDRs.",

The viral genome encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2] . The S glycoprotein is a major envelope protein and interacts with the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for entry into the host cell [3] . This protein consists of the S1 and S2 subunits. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit mediates receptor binding, whereas the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion. DPP4 is expressed on a variety of human cells, including fibroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, and hepatocytes [4] , as well as in the lung parenchyma and interstitium [5, 6] . MERS-CoV is detected in respiratory secretions and the lower respiratory tract of the infected patients [7, 8] . In the most severe cases of MERS-CoV infection, aggravating respiratory failure ultimately results in mechanical ventilation [9] . These observations suggest that the MERS-CoV virus primarily infects the human respiratory tract and replicates within the human airway epithelium [10, 11] .",

These antibodies were generated from B cells derived from convalescent patients, nonimmune human antibody phage-display libraries, fully humanized mice, transchromosomic bovines, or hybridomas from mice that were immunized with MERS-CoV S. These antibodies potently inhibit RBD binding to the DPP4 receptor [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, therapeutic effects of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies were evaluated in several animal models, including Ad5/hDPP4-trasduced mice, humanized DPP4 mice, and hDPP4-transgenic mice as well as hDPP4-knock-in mice, rabbits, and rhesus monkeys [17, 21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

In cynomolgus monkeys, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained dose-proportional concentrations of systemically administrated antibody, and these concentrations were approximately 500-fold less than those in plasma [31] . Therefore, delivery of therapeutic antibody to lung tissues via inhalation has garnered considerable interest. Following delivery via the airway, cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, accumulated in normal and cancerous tissues in the lung at a concentration that was twice that achieved after i.v. delivery [33] . In addition, recent studies showed that Fc fusion proteins and nanobodies are also efficiently delivered via the pulmonary route [34] [35] [36] [37] . Therefore, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody may also accumulate at higher concentrations following delivery via a pulmonary route, suggesting higher efficacy. In order for this pulmonary delivery to be successful, the antibody must be sufficiently stable to resist denaturation during the process of nebulization.",

We defined CDRs according to the International Immunogenetics Information System (IMGT) and targeted Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Met, Trp, and Tyr which were defined as hydrophobic amino acids in previous reports [41, 42] . For the C-8 clone, the F29, Y32, I51, I52, F53, and F54 hydrophobic residues in HCDR1 and HCDR2 were selected for randomization ( Figure 1A ). These six residues were designed to encode the wild-type amino acid, Asp, Glu, or redundant amino acids depending on the degenerate codon in the first scFv phage-display library (Table S2) . We preferred negatively charged amino acids to positively charged amino acids as lowering the isoelectric point of an antibody may reduce the non-specific in vivo clearance [43] . The randomized scFv phage-display library had a complexity of 2.6 \u00d7 10 9 colony-forming units, which exceeded the theoretical complexity of 1.3 \u00d7 10 5 on the nucleotide level. After two rounds of biopanning on recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD protein, we randomly rescued phage clones and performed phage ELISA. Eleven scFv clones showed reactivity to recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD protein similar to or higher than that of the original C-8 clone. The C-8-2 clone harbored F29E and Y32E replacements, while the other ten clones had only one residue replaced with either Asp, Glu, or redundant amino acids, depending on the degenerate codon. To test the stability of the C-8-2 clone during nebulization, a scFv-hFc fusion protein was prepared and subjected to ELISA following nebulization. The reactivity of C-8-2 scFv-hFc to recombinant S glycoprotein was much less affected by nebulization than that of C-8 scFv-hFc; however, the reactivity of the C-8-2 clone was somewhat reduced compared with that of the C-8 clone ( Figure S3A ). one residue replaced with either Asp, Glu, or redundant amino acids, depending on the degenerate codon.

Therefore, engineering of a protein to render it more stable for pulmonary delivery is important. In a recent study, a trivalent nanobody against RSV F protein (ALX-O171) was successfully delivered directly into the lungs by nebulization and neutralized RSV in newborn lambs [46] . In this case, the framework 2 region of the nanobody contained more hydrophilic residues that are not observed in human V H domains and thereby increasing the stability of the nanobody [37] . In this study, we focused on CDRs, as the sequences of the CDR loops are closely related to the folding stability of antibodies [51, 52] . CDR loops frequently possess hydrophobic residues to facilitate high binding affinity; however, solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues also impact antibody stability and aggregation [53] [54] [55] . To increase solubility and counterbalance the impact of the hydrophobic residues required for antibody binding, solubilizing residues can be introduced either at the edges of the CDR loops or within the CDR [56, 57] . Furthermore, negatively charged substitution mutations within CDRs can be used to prevent aggregation [58] . In our study, we employed both strategies and reduced the number of hydrophobic residues and increased the number of charged residues in the CDRs, resulting in successful enhancement of the stability of a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody. The final optimized antibody, C-8-2-4B-10D, showed very limited protein aggregation after nebulization and its biological potency was well maintained after such delivery. Further, we expect that formulation with surfactants such as polysorbate may prevent aggregation of this antibody during nebulization.",
