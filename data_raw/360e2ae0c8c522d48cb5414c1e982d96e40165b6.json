            "text": "Cystic echinococcosis is still a major concern in South America. While some regions show advances in the control of the disease, others have among the highest incidence in the world. To reverse this situation the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has launched a regional project on cystic echinococcosis control and surveillance. An early concern of the program was the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to monitor infection in dogs, a key target of control programs. Under this premise, we have developed a new copro-ELISA test after extensive screening of a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, which performs with high standards of sensitivity (92.6%) and specificity (86.4%) as established by necropsy diagnosis of dogs. The key component of the test, MAbEg9 has a convenient IgG isotype and reacts with a periodate-resistant epitope found in high molecular weight components of the worm. Time-course analysis of experimentally infected dogs showed that even animals with a very low number of parasites could be detected as early as day 20 post infection. The test was formulated in a ready-to-use kit format with proven stability of each component for a minimum of 3 months at room temperature. This characteristic facilitates its standardized use and shipping to other laboratories, which was demonstrated by the identical results obtained by two different laboratories in Peru and our own laboratory when a large number of field samples were analyzed independently in a blind fashion.",

Different control programs aimed to decrease the impact of the disease have been instrumented in many countries. Although the rate of success has been highly variable, it has become evident that a tight control of dog infections is the key element to arrest the life cycle of the parasite. This has created a demand for reliable diagnostic tests for canine echinococcosis as a tool to obtain epidemiological baseline information and help in the surveillance of hydatid control [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, accurate diagnosis of dog infection is complex and challenging, and other than careful necropsy of dogs, there is no perfect gold standard [6] .",

            "text": "Parasitological examination of eggs is unsafe and not very useful because E. granulosus are morphologically difficult to distinguish from other taeniae eggs, and appear late (after the first month) of infection. Traditionally, screening of dogs for E. granulosus has been done by arecoline purgation, followed by examination of the purge for parasites by trained personnel. The method is highly specific, but it is tedious, biohazardous, unpopular among dog owners, and its sensitivity is modest, particularly when the parasite burden is low and bowel evacuation is incomplete [7, 8] . As an alternative, different laboratory tests for ante-mortem diagnosis of canine echinococcosis have been developed, including detection of antibodies in serum, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of parasite DNA and immunological detection of antigens (coproantigens) in fecal samples. Different studies have been carried out to explore the potential use of dog serology to diagnose the disease. However, the systemic immune response to the parasite is poor and consequently the sensitivity attained is also low [4] . Parasite DNA excreted with eggs, proglottids or cells has been detected in fecal specimens by PCR amplification using specific primers derived from mitochondrial DNA [9, 10] . The method has provided the high specificity of PCR, but due to the presence of inhibitors the DNA extraction procedure is cumbersome and the technique requires expensive reagents and specialized laboratories [11] . In addition, the pre-patent period of the infection, when there is no egg production, is a critical time-window that challenges the sensitivity of the test. Introduced at the beginning of the 1990's, the detection of parasite antigens in fecal samples by immunoassays became a widely accepted diagnostic test [12, 13] . The major attractive features of the method include its simplicity, the possibility of detecting parasite components even in the prepatent period, and the fact that the target antigens (coproantigens) are highly stable. Samples can be collected in 1% of 40% formaldehyde and kept at room temperature for extended periods of time, facilitating the logistics of large-scale studies in remote areas [7, [14] [15] [16] . The study of a large group of infected dogs necropsied at the end of the pre-patent period demonstrated a superior sensitivity for the copro-ELISA (83%), when compared to copro-PCR (26%) or arecoline purgation (43 and 77% after one or two doses, respectively). Most failures to detect positive infected dogs occurred when the number of worms was less than one hundred [5] .",

Stool samples from each dog were collected daily during the experimental period, at the end which (27-30 days post-infection (dpi)), the animals infected with E. granulosus were euthanized for necropsy diagnosis by intramuscular injection of acepromazine maleate (0.11 mg/kg) and ketamine (20 mg/kg) (Laboratorio Holliday, Argentina), following by an intravenous overdose of sodium thiopental (Laboratorio Crusur Vet, Uruguay). The dogs infected with T. hydatigena were purged at 70 dpi with arecoline bromhydrate (Crescent Chemical Co. Inc., New York, USA), following by treatment with anti-parasitic drugs. Three additional samples from dogs experimentally infected with E. granulosus (26 dpi) and two with T. hydatigena (about 55 dpi) from previous studies [14, 16] were obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Carlos Carmona. In addition, 85 unwanted dogs from the province of Chubut, Argentina, and 11 unwanted dogs from Junin, Peru, were euthanized following the procedure described above, and the small intestines were removed post mortem, opened longitudinally and examined directly for the presence of parasites following the recommendations of the WHO/OIE [17] . All activities were performed following the local legislation and the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals (http://www.cioms.ch/).",

The adult worm parasitizes the small intestine of dogs, which become infected after eating offal of an animal contaminated with the parasite, and releases eggs into the environment that can be accidentally ingested by domestic animals or humans, maintaining the life cycle of the parasite. Deworming of dogs is a major component of control programs, and simple and reliable methods are needed to monitor the base-line infection in the canine population. The lack of these tests was recognized as a major obstacle to the PAHO effort to control the disease in South America. This paper describes the development of a diagnostic assay that detects parasite antigens in dog feces. The key component is a monoclonal antibody carefully selected to attain high levels of sensitivity and specificity, which were established with a large panel of field fecal samples obtained from animals diagnosed by necropsy. Several aspects of the long-term stability of the test were optimized to facilitate its shelf-life and transference to other laboratories.",

Cross-reactivity with T. hydatigena coproanti-gens did not seem to be a major problem when the time course of coproantigen excretion was study with the Eg9 copro-ELISA ( figure 5 ). Using the cut-off estimated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from the analysis of field samples (see below), only on very few occasions and after 40 dpi were some of the samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs positive. The Eg9 copro-ELISA allowed an earlier detection of infected dogs. Animals with 200 or more parasites became positive between 12-15 dpi and by dpi 20 all infected dogs were positives and remained so thereafter. Curiously, coproantigens in dogs P7 and P8 samples could be detected very early.

Upon necropsy, 9 of 85 dogs from Chubut, and 6 of 11 dogs from Junin were positive for E. granulosus, 48 were infected with other parasites and 33 were found negative, table 1. Fecal samples from these dogs were tested using the CPR39 and Eg9 copro-ELISAs and the cutoff selected from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [18] to have a convenient balance between sensitivity and specificity as follows: CPR39 ELISA = 0.224 AU and Eg9 ELISA = 0.340 AU. Using these values, the sensitivity of the tests were 80.0 and 86.6% respectively, which is in agreement with the results obtained with the experimental infection of dogs, figure 4 . The specificity of the Eg9 test was also superior 86.4% versus 82.7% for the CPR39 ELISA. In addition, the CPR39 test produced readings close to the cut-off for an important number of samples, figure 6 , which may be problematic for the use of a cutoff internal calibrator, because small inter-assay variations in the reading of the calibrator may have an important effect upon the number of samples that are classified in either category. Actually, if samples that fall between 610% of the cut-off are considered as undetermined (a common practice), none of the samples analyzed with the Eg9 test would fall in this category, while four of the samples analyzed with the CPR39 would. While it was not possible to obtain an exact counting of parasites in the dogs from the province of Chubut, this was feasible in the case of the animals necropsied in Junin. Although most dogs had a large number of worms, two of them did not, and these two dogs were exaustively examined. We found only 9 E. granulosus and 2 Ascaris lumbricoides, and 47 E. granulosus and very few Dipylidium caninum worms in the first and second dogs, respectively. Interestingly, the average absorbance readings of the fecal samples obtained from these animal were 1.16 and 2.99 AU, which represent strong positive results, indicating the sensitivity of the test and confirming the capacity of the assay to detect small numbers of parasites that had been observed in the experimentally infected dogs. In this regard, when the E. granulosus positive dogs from the experimental infection are included, the overall sensitivity of the test rises to 92.6%. Despite the fact that MAbEg9 was selected for its reduced cross-reactivity with the ThSm antigen, most of its cross-reactivity was against dogs infected with T. spp (mostly hydatigena) alone or together with other parasites. Only one dog infected with T. canis (1.44 AU) and one of the non-infected dogs (0.694 AU) from the province of Chubut were classified as positive with the Eg9 ELISA, figure 6 . The relatively high readings of these two samples are unexpected. Based on the results of the experimental infection of dogs and the fact that all other samples (19) from dogs harboring T. canis alone or together with Dipylidium caninum showed very low readings, a misdiagnosis at necropsy can not be discarded. It is worth noting that cross-reactivity was essentially against Taenia. Despite the fact that we could not identify to species all field samples, the great majority of samples from Chubut and all from Junin corresponded to T. hydatigena; hence most false positive results will be related to dogs eating offal.

            "text": "The Eg9 test was then formulated in a kit format to facilitate its use and transference to other laboratories. Initially, we studied different conditions for coating and drying the plates and found that using sugars as additives during drying have the best effect on the stability of the capture antibody. Trehalose and sucrose showed the best results and the latter was chosen because of its much lower cost. Figure 7A shows that dried plates showed similar capacity as fresh ones to discriminate between weak positive and negative samples over a one year period of storage at 4uC. Similar results were obtained after 2 years of storage (not shown). To set up the value of the cut-off an internal standard was prepared by adjusting the dilution of the E. granulosus Sm antigen in order to produce a readout equal to the value of the cut-off. The stability of this cut-off calibrator solution and other components of the assay (in their ready-to-use dilution) were tested using different diluent buffers at 4uC, room temperature, and 37uC, and some representative results are shown in figure 7B-D. Different formulations of the calibrator solution were stable over a 6 month period, even at 37uC; only the results for the Sm antigen diluted in PBS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Kathon (Dow Chemicals, Midland, Michigan) are shown. The reactivity of MAb Eg9 started to diminish after a few days at 37uC, but was highly stable over the 6 month period at 4uC (not shown) or at room temperature, figure 7C . The most critical component was the secondary antibody. For several different formulations (only two shown in figure 7D ) all of them rapidly lost the enzymatic activity at 37uC, but using PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Kathon, 0.1 mM TMB, the conjugate remained stable for up to 150 days at room temperature (or 4uC, not shown). Overall, we can conclude that even at room temperature the kit has a safe shelf life of 3 months, which can surely be extended upon refrigeration, which is a convenient advantage for the shipment and use of the kit in remote places. Due to the availability of commercial ready-to-use TMB substrate solutions, the preparation of this kit component was not pursued in this study. In case of high demand of the kit, it will be necessary to prepare new PAb. In our experience, this is a critical component of the test, but we have selected similarly performing PAbs from a panel of 3 to 4 immunized rabbits, after initial selection with fecal samples from dogs harboring low number of E. granulosus parasites and counter selection with samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs.",

The samples were independently analyzed by the three laboratories and classified as positive, negative or uncertain if their readout felt within the calibrator absorbance reading 610% range. Twenty four samples were positive, indicating a prevalence of 46.1% in the studied areas (Canchayllo and Jauja). The kit performed with excellent reproducibility and all individual samples were equally classified by the three laboratories with the exception of two of the samples with readings close to the cut-off, one of them categorized as negative by two of the labs and uncertain by the third one, and another sample classified as (weak) positive by two of the labs and uncertain by the remaining one.",
