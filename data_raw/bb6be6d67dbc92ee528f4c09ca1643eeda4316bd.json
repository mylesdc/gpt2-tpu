It is characterized by epidemics that occur seasonally throughout the world every year, with occasional pandemics arising from novel subtypes of the virus causing a considerable economic burden and significant cumulative morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Despite a plethora of information on influenza epidemiology and seasonality, which remains important in planning prevention and treatment strategies, overall patterns of infection have not been fully described on broad geographic scales and for specific types and subtypes of the influenza virus, thus highlighting the need for more countries to conduct year-round viral surveillance and report reliable incidence data at the type and subtype level, especially in the tropics [4] .",

Cambodia is a South-East Asian tropical country, which lies geographically in the Northern hemisphere but its influenza season occurs during June-December, each year [12] . Northern hemisphere countries usually experience influenza season from November to March/April, whereas the influenza season of southern hemisphere countries usually occur from May to September [13, 14] .

To continuously monitor influenza activity, an outpatient sentinel surveillance system for influenza-like illness (ILI) with a weekly reporting and sampling scheme was initially established in five hospital sites in 2006. In addition, hospital-based surveillance of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) cases was established in two sites in Takeo and Kampong Cham provincial hospitals (SISEA project, French Agency for Development). Three additional ILI sentinel surveillance sites were then opened in 2009 and operated by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in collaboration with the US CDC local office in the referral hospitals of Mondulkiri (Eastern Cambodia), Svayreang (South-East Cambodia) and Kampot (South-West Cambodia) Provinces. The Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) operated one sentinel site starting in 2009 in Western Cambodia in Thmor Kol (Battambang Province), and opened two additional sentinel sites in 2011 in Anlong Veng (Oddar Meancheay Province) and Pailin. During the pandemic of influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, an event-based surveillance system was developed by CDC/MoH and WHO. The system was designed for rapid detection, reporting and confirmation of clusters of the disease or suspected cases admitted in both private clinics and hospitals [16] .",

In contrast, this study combined with our previous analysis of influenza activity in Cambodia from 2006 to 2008 has demonstrated that the seasonality of influenza in Cambodia, which is located in the northern hemisphere, has a consistent pattern characteristic of influenza circulation in the southern hemisphere, peaking during the rainy season from June to November as we previously reported [12] . Cambodian influenza activity reveals a discrete peak for influenza A during June-December, whereas year round circulation of influenza B and rare cases of H5N1 and other influenza A viruses occur during the dry season.

As previously reported in our study from 2006 to 2008 [12] , the proportion of severe influenza infections detected among hospitalized patients with ALRI from 2009 to 2010 during the influenza season was lower compared to the number of patients positive for influenza virus observed in the ILI surveillance system ( Figure S1 ). During 2009-2010 periods, only 2.6% of the patients recruited in ALRI surveillance were identified as positive for influenza virus infection, whereas 16.9% were observed among patients within the NIC's ILI surveillance. This low frequency of severe influenza cases, which was also found in another Cambodian study [22] could be related to yearly variations in influenza severity [23] ; however, the true burden of severe influenza is likely to be underestimated. Although the cases detected were from hospital-based surveillance, there might be an unknown proportion of cases that were missed due to poor access to hospital care. This is particularly an issue in developing countries such as Cambodia [23] . Furthermore, some studies have shown that influenza viruses predispose to secondary bacterial infections [24, 25] and we cannot exclude that bacterial lung infections diagnosed among patients recruited in our ALRI study were not associated with initial influenza disease. In developing countries such as Cambodia poor access to healthcare may result in late presentation to hospitals and clinics when influenza is no longer detectable in clinical specimens. To rule out this hypothesis, serological testing for influenza exposure is required among patients with bacterial respiratory infections during the seasonal influenza epidemics. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection detected both in event-based surveillance and sentinel-based surveillance systems occurred in all age groups. However, the median ages of event-based patients tended to be older than that of influenza positive patients detected in ILI surveillance. This finding is consistent with the characteristics of hospitalized cases observed in the USA [26] .",

Positive cases of this virus were thereafter detected from communities around the capital and from the ILI sentinel sites in Siem Reap and Battambang Province by both event-based and sentinel surveillance from August 2009. In October 2009, the virus spread throughout the country as indicated by ILI and ALRI surveillance data. The number of A/H1N1pdm09 virus isolates detected by the event-based surveillance compared to the number detected by the sentinel (ILI and ALRI) surveillance systems during the highest point of the outbreak in October 2009 was 5:1 (Figure 2 ), suggesting that when it comes to the timely detection of outbreaks and important public health events, event-based surveillance is more sensitive than sentinel surveillance systems, which are not suited to the detection of rare but high-impact outbreaks of emerging and unknown diseases [16] . However, at the start of the influenza season in June 2010, the A/H1N1pdm09 isolates were first detected by both the event-based and sentinel surveillance systems before being mostly detected by the sentinel surveillance system for the rest of the season. This finding is consistent with the WHO's declaration on 10 August 2010 that the World was moving into the post-pandemic period and confirmed that this virus was taking on the behavior of a seasonal influenza virus [30] .",

During this period, limited data from Vietnam indicated community transmission of influenza there as well, predominantly influenza type B, but the remainder of southern Asia including India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Singapore, China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Southern China and Chinese Taipei reported small numbers of a mixture of all three circulating types [32] . The circulation of type B virus tends to rise as overall influenza activity declines. There was a surge of influenza B cases near the end of each influenza season, usually from November to December, as shown in our previous report from 2006 to 2008 [12] . There are frequent bottleneck years during which prevalence of B strains is low, which usually was correlated with high prevalence of influenza A strains. Table 2 ) [12] . Currently, seasonal influenza vaccines are only available through private market purchase and Cambodians are not accustomed to influenza vaccination [33] . However, it could be problematic if the B strain that was circulating did not match the one contained in the seasonal influenza vaccine. Mismatches between influenza B strains circulating in Cambodia and strains included in the trivalent vaccine should lead to the use of a quadrivalent vaccine that contains both influenza B lineages.",

In Cambodia, no amantadine-resistant strains were found in seasonal influenza viruses in 2006, but the prevalence increased to 100% in 2007 and was maintained at this level through 2011 [12] . This finding supports that of a study conducted by another group reporting that adamantane resistance in influenza A viruses increased in 2007 in South East Asia [36] . Surveillance for antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses in the Asia-Pacific region during 2011, showed that .99% of influenza A strains continued to be resistant to the adamantane drugs [37] . The high levels of amantadine resistance in influenza A virus strains in the community were not related to domestic amantadine use, as antiviral drugs for upper respiratory infection is uncommon among Cambodians. Following the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, an unusually high prevalence of amantadine resistance has been observed most prominently in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan since 2003, probably due to widespread use of amantadine [34, 38] . However, there was also evidence that the spread of resistant A/H3N2 virus was related to linked fitness mutations and not related to drug pressure [39, 40] . Cambodia's rise of resistance in 2007 may therefore reflect a strong influence from China or Taiwan in terms of influenza transmission.",

The general lack of primary resistance to this class of antiviral has been previously reported before introduction of the neuraminidase inhibitors anywhere in the world [41] . In 2008, a low prevalence of neuraminidase inhibitors resistance (,1%) was detected in isolates from untreated patients [42] . During 2011, neuraminidase inhibitors resistance in A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2 and B viruses in the Asia-Pacific region remained low (,3% and ,1% for influenza A and B strains respectively) [37] . Therefore, it is not surprising that all Cambodian isolates tested retained sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, in our previous study, we detected two influenza A/H1N1 strains with the H275Y mutation, associated with a high level of resistance to oseltamivir [43] . One of these strains detected in October 2007 showed high resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors by antiviral drug susceptibility assay, even though the other strain could not be grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Following the emergence in Europe in late 2007 of a transmissible human A/H1N1 influenza strain that was highly resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, the emergence of similar viruses was observed in South Africa and several countries in Oceania and South East Asia, especially from May 2008 onwards [44] . However, the mutant H275Y virus found in Cambodia is not a variant of the emergent H275Y strain detected elsewhere, but instead has arisen independently, as occasionally reported previously [42, 45] .",

Each group, except the group from 2010-2011, belonged to the phylogenetic group represented by the corresponding vaccine strain. We previously demonstrated that there was co-circulation of different lineages of viruses isolated in 2005 and probable re-emergence of A/H3N2 viruses in the two consecutive seasons of 2005-2006 [42] . The HA sequences from the A/H3N2 isolates from 2009 to 2011 fell within three distinct phylogenetic clades. These findings are consistent with the dynamic evolution of A/H3N2 viruses that present a characteristic co-circulation of several variants for up to three years, which are subsequently replaced by new emerging variants with different antigenic features. This constant evolution of A/H3N2 viruses leads to the emergence of new viral variants that can elude the human immune response, causing outbreaks [46, 47] . This viral reintroduction plays a key role in the genesis of new clades and the global spread of these novel influenza virus variants. The Cambodian isolates collected from each season seem to have evolved from common ancestor isolates that are also probably at the origin of Australian srains [43, 48] . Additional research is required to more precisely define factors that contribute to this influenza seasonality in Cambodia such as the role of climate in triggering seasonal epidemics and the role for natural selection and host susceptibility.",

The known antigenic sites in the HA of the 1918 pandemic virus have been conserved in the pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 virus [53] . Molecular analysis showed that these sites were relatively conserved in Cambodian isolates. Two isolates, A/Cambodia/T282/2009 and A/Cambodia/T057/ 2009, which caused mild symptoms, possessed the R205K variation at the Ca1 antigenic site of the hemagglutinin without altering the properties of the polar and basic amino acid. The other two isolates from 2010 (A/Cambodia/U099/2010 and A/Cambodia/U326/ 2010) and one isolate from 2011 (A/Cambodia/V0608350/2011), which caused severe illness, had a substitution N125D at the hemagglutinin Sa antigenic site, which slightly modified the properties of the neutral side chain to a basic one. Immunological pressure may have driven virus evolution as shown by the displacement of E374E by E374K, a site important for membrane fusion, and the emergence of the two R205K and N125D amino acid substitutions involving the antigenic sites Ca1 and Sa respectively [54] . These antigenic sites contain many amino acids involved in neutralising epitopes near the receptor-binding pockets [53] . Although a single amino acid substitution involving one antigenic site may be sufficient to cause antigenic change, more commonly antigenic drift variants of epidemiological importance have resulted from changes of at least four amino acids across two or more antigenic sites [55] . Thus the variations observed in the hemagglutinin region of Cambodian A/H1N1pdm09 virus isolates most likely did not affect the antigenicity of the viruses. Although the results from antigenic analysis of Cambodian strains support this hypothesis, in vitro results cannot always predict in vivo effects.",

Interestingly, the influenza B viruses that circulated in 2010 were found to have evolved from different genetic groups, indicating that the outbreak was caused by multiple sources. All of the influenza B viruses collected in 2009 and the majority of the 2010 and 2011 viruses possessed amino acid substitutions N75K, N165K and S172P that defined genetic group 1 in which the vaccine B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain was grouped. All of the 2009 and some of the 2010 viruses carried the amino acid substitution K56R compared with the vaccine B/ Brisbane/60/2008 strain; some strains from 2010-2011 viruses carried the substitution T37I and L58P; some isolates from 2010 and all strains from 2011 contained amino acid I146V compared with the vaccine B/Brisbane/60/2008. None of these substitutions had a marked effect on the antigenicity of the viruses. This is not unusual, as influenza B virus activity is highly variable world-wide, with no established pattern [56] . However, this could lead to the emergence of influenza B reassortants in the next influenza season [57] .",

As the collection and initial analysis of samples was conducted in numerous clinics and laboratories respectively, the influenza strains included in this study were subject to any sampling or testing biases that were inherent in the different studies. The analyses presented in the study were also limited to the data available to the NIC and did not include epidemiological information such as detailed admission data and rates of infection. In addition, samples were not collected throughout 2009-2011 for some of the studies (such as event-based surveillance for H1N1pdm09) and some of the study sites did not contribute samples throughout the entire study period. As a large number of samples were tested throughout the study (n = 10,813) only a representative number of isolates could be further analysed for genetic, antigenic and antiviral drug resistance characteristics. However, a large proportion of isolates were also sent to WHOCCs for further characterization (data not shown).",

Since September 2009, there has been sustained circulation of predominantly A/H1N1pdm09 viruses. Seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and B virus have also circulated, although to a lesser extent. In 2010 there continued to be co-circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2 and B viruses, with the latter two being predominant from November and December 2010 through 2011. The influenza virus epidemics in Cambodia occurred through genetically distinct multiple viruses, even if all of the isolates had similar antigenicity to the reference vaccine strain. The drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains showed that neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective and not recommended for use [58] . Despite the reduced number of influenza vaccines used in Cambodia, policy makers should consider the use of a quadrivalent vaccine (when available) to counter the co-circulation of the two influenza A lineages.

The trees were created with the corresponding regions of 21 HA sequences from strains isolated from various other South-East Asian countries (Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and Singapore). As seen inFigure4 almost all of the Cambodian isolates fell into the S203T clade.

It can be clearly seen that Cambodian influenza B isolates in 2009 to 2011 belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage represented by the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. All of the 2009 isolates, most of the 2010 isolates and more than two thirds of the 2011 isolates belonged to genetic group 1 (including influenza B vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008), sharing amino acid changes at positions N75K, N165K and S172P. There were three subgroups within genetic group 1: one subgroup with isolates collected in 2009 and 2010, shared amino acid changes at K56R and V146I in the HA; another subgroup of strains isolated in 2011 (which had two different subgroups with mutation N129D and A154E respectively); and the other subgroup with some of the isolates collected in 2010 and one strain in 2011, shared an amino acid change at L58P in the HA. Some other viruses collected in 2011 and one 2010 isolate belonged to genetic group 2 sharing an amino acid change T37I which was a specific mutation of genetic group 2. No influenza B viruses isolated between 2009 and 2011 belonged to the B/Yamagata-lineage represented by vaccine strain B/Wisconsin/01/2010. Regions of the Cambodian influenza B virus isolates containing 347 amino acids of HA were compared with those of reference vaccine strains in order to understand the variations within the Victoria lineage of influenza B viruses (Table S4). The Victoria lineage strains were divided into two distinct groups, B/Malaysia/ 2506/2004 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Table S4). All Cambodian influenza B viruses isolated between 2009 and 2011 presented in this study and the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008 had two amino acid changes (S134P and A199T) compared to B/ Malaysia/2506/2004. The B viruses isolated from 2009, 2010 and 2011, which belong to genetic group 1 of Victoria lineage, had three common amino acid changes from B/Malaysia/2506/2004 at N75K, N165K and S172P in their HA genes. In this genetic group 1 of Cambodian influenza B viruses, the subgroup of isolates in 2009 and 2010, had amino acid changes at K56R and V146I. The subgroup of strains isolated in 2011 had two different subgroups with the mutations N129D and A154E respectively. The other subgroup, containing some of the isolates collected in 2010 and 1 strain of 2011, shared an amino acid change at L58P in the HA. The other amino acid changes of this genetic group 1, compared to the B/Malaysia/2506/2004 strain, occurred at I7V for the B/Cambodia/T1231151/2009 strain, K162N for the B/ Cambodia/U0707330/2010 strain, S255P for the B/Cambodia/ V1103320/2011 strain and K345R for the B/Cambodia/ U1102389/2010 strain. Some other isolates from 2011 and one isolate from 2010 were clustered together in genetic group 2 of Victoria lineage. These strains had one common amino acid change from B/Malaysia/2506/2004 at T37I; and variation occurring at P31S and N197S for the B/Cambodia/30/2011 strain; and at V90I for the B/Cambodia/V0316324/2011 strain.
