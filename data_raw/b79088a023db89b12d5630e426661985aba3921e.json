To explore the distribution of N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) in these two glycoproteins, we collected and aligned the amino acid sequences of all the HA and NA subtypes. Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes. Two to four conserved glycosites were found in the stalk domain of NA, but these are affected by the deletion of specific stalk domain sequences. Another highly conserved glycosite appeared at the top center of tetrameric global domain, while the others glycosites were distributed around the global domain. Here we present a detailed investigation of the distribution and the evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, and further focus on the H5N1 virus and conclude that the glycosites in H5N1 have become more complicated in HA and less influential in NA in the last five years.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IVs), which belong to the orthomyxoviridae family, consist of eight negative RNA strands. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two glycoproteins that are encoded by the IV genome, expressed from segments 4 and 6, respectively. The selection due to various host immune systems and anti-flu drugs accelerate the mutation rates of viral proteins, especially for these two membrane proteins [1, 2] . There are 17 HA subtypes and 10 NA subtypes, designated H1-H17 and N1-N10, respectively. Over 118 combinations of IVs can be isolated from wild birds, which are also the natural reservoir of these viruses (except the H17N10 virus, which, until recently, was isolated only from bat) [3] [4] [5] . The species jumping ability of IVs can result in the infections of poultry and mammals, such as chicken, swine, equine or whale species, with different virulence levels [6] [7] [8] [9] . The H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 viruses have been responsible for tens of millions deaths during the deadly history of human influenza epidemics. Furthermore, the H5N1, H7N7, H7N2, H7N3 and H9N2 viruses have been isolated from sporadic human infections and deaths [10] [11] [12] [13] . It is worth noting that the H5N1 virus is the most severe for human and avian species, with sudden onset and high mortality. The mortality rate in hundreds of patients who were hospitalized for H5N1 infections was roughly 59.05%, much higher than the mortality rates of the Spanish Flu or the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) [11, 14, 15] .",

HA unfold and expose the interior HA2 subunits in the acid environment, then the fusion peptides in HA2 insert themselves into the host membrane (viral membrane fusion) [20, 21] .",

The biosynthesis and modification of nascent secretory or membrane proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, N-linked glycans encode crucial information for the folding, maturation, transport or degradation of proteins [29] . To escape both the host's humoral and cellular immune systems, the potential glycosites in viral envelope proteins can provide the identical glycans as those of the host's cells to mask the antigenic sites [28, 30] . Additionally, glycosylation also impacts the sensitivity of HA to temperature, the protection of cleavage sites and the stalk domain, and even the receptor-binding preferences [31] [32] [33] . As the ideal model for the influence of N-glycosylation in pathogen-host interaction, the present studies show that the envelope glycoproteins of IVs appear to only have N-glycosylation, with no O-glycosylation and GPI-anchors [34] ; hence, the glycosites discussed in this paper only pertain to N-glycosylation site.

In addition, another highly conserved glycosite appears at C-terminal part of the HA1 sequence, which is near the connection of the global and stalk domains, except in H7 and H15 sequences [52] . Three to ten characteristic glycosites were distinctive in each subtype. Their conservative rates were influenced by different internal evolution branches, ranked from 0.5% (e.g., 292NGS with 2.85% in H3) to 100% (e.g., 38NGT with 99.94% in H3), distributed mainly in the global domain. It is worth mentioning that some highly conserved glycosites were near to cysteines (Figure 1 ).

Most glycosites were influenced by the deletion or insertion of the mutants in the upstream sequence, which is also known as ''antigenic drift'' [54] . In the HAs of the H1N1 or H5N1 viruses, some nearby glycosites were determined by ''antigenic shift'' [55] . In the H1 subtypes, the 144NVT glycosite from the seasonal H1N1 flu, which were isolated from 1940s to 1980s (e.g., A/Memphis/1/1984 (H1N1)), was replaced by the 142NHT glycosite after the 1990s (e.g., A/California/04/ 2007 (H1N1)). Additionally, no such glycosylation appeared in those H1N1 viruses isolated from swine H1N1 flu (e.g., A/swine/ Guangdong/1604/2010 (H1N1)), Spanish flu (e.g., A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1)) and the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) (e.g., A/Mexico city/CIA1/2009 (H1N1)). It has been partially shown that vaccination of mice with the 1918 influenza strain protected against subsequent lethal infection by the 2009 virus; however, the 1918 strain did not protect against the seasonal H1N1 flu [56] . It is interesting to note that the migration of the 179NKS to 177NLS tracks with these effects. Almost all of the 179NKS glycosites identified were centralized in swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIVs, e.g., A/Swine/Guandong/1604/2010 (H1N1)) and parts of the 2009 influeza pandemic H1N1 virus (e.g., A/Mexico City/014/2009 (H1N1)), while the 177NLS glycosite was mainly found in the swine or human H1N2 viruses (e.g., A/ New York/481/2003 (H1N2)) and most seasonal flu viruses (e.g., A/California/04/2007 (H1N1)). These date further confirm that the HA of the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) originated from S-OIV, not previous seasonal virus [57] . Similar positional conversion of the glycosites in H5N1 caused by ''antigenic drift'' was the ''179NYT/181NNT''. The conserved 181NNT glycosites have been replaced by the 179NYT in parts of clade 7 viruses since 2005. It reminds us that although these glycosites were adjacent, their N-glycans would shield different antigenic sites, which would provide some suggestions for the development of influenza vaccine.",

The glycosite of 146N is conservative in all NA subtypes (e.g., 146NDT in A/Boston/20/2008(H3N2), 144NGT in A/duck/ Taiwan/4201/99(H7N7) or 146NGT in /Viet Nam/1203/ 2004(H5N1)). It has been shown that the N-glycan at this glycosite affects NA enzymatic activity, causing a 20-fold decrease in activity [58] . Similar to the description of HAs, a large number of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N2 and H9N2 viruses have accumulated numerous glycosites in N1 and N2, especially in the global domain, mainly participating in immune evasion. Moreover, one conserved glycosite, 12NTT (Conservative rate: 93%, e.g., A/ turkey/Italy/3807/2004 (H7N3)), located in the transmembrane domain in N3 and N10, requires further investigation [59] .",

The variance of the glycosites was closely related to the deletion of the stalk domain. Although the threedimensional structure of stalk domain has not been determined yet, it is speculated that the presence of an a-helix motif in the uncrystallized structure has also been provided by cryoelectron microscopy [62] . Wagner et al. believed that a longer stem domain would enhance the replication capacity of the virus, while the deletion of the stem domain would decrease the enzymatic activity of NA [63] . Various subtypes had stalk domain deletions of 3 to 24 residues, except for N4, N8, N9 and N10. The numbers of deletions were also distinctive across different combinations of IVs and even within one subtype, such as the N2 subtype. Generally, no deletions were found in the NA of the H3N2 virus; deletion of 3 residues and one corresponding glycosite with the pattern ''E-R-61N-3-64T-V-H'' (meaning 3 residues missing between 61N and 64T, e.g., A/chicken/Zhejiang/611/ 2011 (H9N2)), appeared in most of the NA subtypes of the H9N2 virus. A similar deletion of 20 residues and two glycosites (I-E-60R-20-80N-I-I) appeared in most NA subtypes of the H6N2 virus (e.g., A/duck/Fujian/3193/2005 (H6N2)). The deletion of 16 residues and two glycosites as ''C-E-55P-16-72T-T-E'' were a distinctive part of the H7N2 virus (e.g., A/unknown/New York/19501-5/2006 (H7N2)). Parts of the H5N2 virus were characterized by the deletion of 20 residues and two glycosites (''R-N-62I-20-83G-Y-R'', e.g., A/chicken/Ibaraki/3/2005 (H5N2)). Moreover, in some avian H2N2 viruses, the deletion of 22 residues resulted in the loss of two glycosites; however, a new glycosite appeared in the newly created sequences (''P-A-47N-22-70N-T-V'', e.g., A/chicken/New York/Sg-00300/1997 (H2N2)). In all, the diversity of deletions in the stalk domain indicates that the glycosylation pattern of HA and NA has a complex relationship.",

However, these characteristics had been reported even before 1990s. The earliest H5N1 virus, ''A/ chicken/Scotland/1959 (H5N1)'', had four continuous basic residues in the HA0 cleavage site (compared to 5,6 continuous basic residues in most common H5N1 HAs); the stalked deletion of NA also existed in A/turkey/Ontario/84/1983 (H5N1). The records of H5N1 virus have increased rapidly since 2003. Since then, a number of new clades and subclades have emerged and resulted in various new glycosites ( Figure 3A and 3B) . The percentage of unconserved glycosites in HA also increased and diversified rapidly after 2003, meanwhile the percentage of unconserved glycosites in NA reduced gradually, regardless of those highly-conserved glycosites ( Figure 3C and 3D) .",

In general, two highly conserved glycosites near the HA0 cleavage site and fusion peptide site may maintain the basic function of HA; these sites were seldom absent in the HA subtypes. More glycosites were identified in the global domain or in the connection of global and stalk domains, along with longterm and large-scale epidemics in several of the subtypes. The distributional regularity of the glycosites in the NA subtypes is also complex; two to four glycosites located in the stalk domain are highly conserved in various subtypes, and are affected by the deletion of the stalk domain. Another highly conserved glycosite was found at the tip of tetramer NA in all subtypes. Other glycosites were found to be mainly concentrated in the global domain, which surrounds the antigenic sites.",

Five highly conserved glycosites in HA had existed before the H5N1 virus first crossed species barriers and infected humans, as well as two additional glycosites, 181NVT and 170NST. Since 2003, the H5N1 virus has exhibited a rapid evolutionary dynamic. Under the selection pressure of different hosts and antigenic drift, the glycosite pattern of current H5N1 viruses in different geographical locations has been distinctive: the HA in clade 2.2.1.1, isolated from Egypt, lacked the 181N glycosite but had added the 88NVS glycosite. In addition, the HA in clade 2.3.2.1, isolated from China or Vietnam, lacked the 170N glycosite but had added the 152N glycosite. In contrast, as the glycosites in HA became more diverse in the H5N1 virus, the glycosylation in NA was impaired by a decreasing number of glycosites. The NAs of current H5N1 viruses lack a stalk domain and the four corresponding glycosites; except the four high conserved glycosites in the global domain, others glycosites have rarely been identified.",

(A) Most adjacent glycosites in one region were determined by antigenic drift, compared to a fraction of nearby glycosites that were caused by antigen shift. Although the 144NVT/142NHT glycosites are common in seasonal H1N1 viruses, they have different origins. The 177NLS/179NKS glycosites were another common feature in the H1N1 virus. Obviously, the seasonal IVs with long-term circulation had more glycosites than the avian flu or pandemic flu. (B) The pattern of stalk domain deletion in N2 NA is distinctive in different combinations of IVs. The representative NA sequences in each available N2 subtypes are aligned in the stalk domain. As can be observed, the number of deletions varies from 4 to 24 residues, causing the loss of one or two potential glycosites. Among these, a new glycosite emerged in the restructured NA of the avian H2N2 virus. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0049224.g002[47]. In summary, complete structures are unavailable.

(A) The viruses with glycosylated and nonglycosylated 170N and 181N, which are the key glycosites in H5N1 HA, co-existed even before 1997. The nearby glycosites caused by ''antigenic drift'' were the ''179NYT/181NNT''. The conserved 181NNT glycosite have been replaced by the 179NYT in parts of clade 7 viruses since 2005 (36 records in H5 set). Most viruses in clade 2.2 and clade 2.3.2 displayed the deficiency of 158N glycosite, while clade 1.1 and clade 2.3.4 exhibited the conservation of the 158N glycosite.
