            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a highly transmissive virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which comprises several other pathogens that threaten human health. This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation. Additionally, affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug U18666A, which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes, impairs the viral life cycle. The data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways. This highlights the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals.",

Nevertheless, there are conflicting data about the relevance of AXL as the primary receptor of ZIKV entry [16] [17] [18] . After internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is assumed that the acidification of the late endosomes, also termed multivesicular bodies (MVBs), promotes a structural change in the viral envelope, allowing the fusion between the endosomal membrane and the envelope. This leads to the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and, consequently, to the disassembling of the capsid and the uncoating of the viral RNA [19, 20] . After the genomic RNA has been translated and replicated, a newly synthesized immature viral particle is assembled and conducted to the secretory pathway. In this immature form, the pr peptide covers approximately 12 amino acids of the fusion loop of the envelope protein and, thus, prevents premature fusion within the cell. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the viral particle undergoes maturation as a result of a structural modification induced by the low pH that allows the cleavage of the prM by a furin-like protease, exposing the fusion loop. Lastly, the infectious viral particle exits the cell by exocytosis and the pr fragment dissociates from the virion due to the neutral pH of the extracellular environment [21, 22] .",

Since there is no vaccine or a specific antiviral drug available against ZIKV, understanding the viral life cycle and finding ways to control infection has become urgent. Although the ZIKV life cycle is often described to resemble the life cycle of other flavivirus members, a variety of open questions with respect to the viral life cycle still exists. In light of this, the importance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. Firstly, the acidification of the late endosomes/MVBs and the TGN compartments was impaired by the highly selective inhibitor of the vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase), bafilomycin A1 [27] . The relevance of the acidification of the endosomal compartment for ZIKV entry has been previously studied in Huh 7 cells by Cortese et al., more recently,. Our data from A549 cells show that on the one hand, bafilomycin A1 was able to fully inhibit ZIKV entry and, on the other hand, it interferes with viral maturation. Concerning the SH-SY5Y cells, bafilomycin A1 decreased ZIKV entry. In the second part of this study, the functionality of the late endosomes and lysosomes was hindered by the amphipathic steroid drug, U18666A. U18666A inhibits the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and lipids by the direct inhibition of the Niemann-Pick type C protein. This results in cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/MVBs and lysosomes, which leads to the impairment of their functionality [31] . Several reports showed that U18666A inhibits crucial steps of dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus and feline coronavirus life cycles [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, no studies were performed to investigate the impact of U18666A on ZIKV infection.",

To investigate this, A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were pre-treated with 10 nM bafilomycin A1 and two hours later, in the presence of this substance, the cells were infected using an MOI of 0.1 with either the French Polynesia PF13/251013-18 or the Uganda 976 strain. Analysis of the infection was performed at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and, in the case of the SH-SY5Y cells, was also analyzed at 48 hpi. The quantification of the number of intra-and extracellular viral genomes by RT-qPCR revealed no significant amount of ZIKV RNA for both strains ( Figure 1A ,B) in A549 cells. This finding indicates that bafilomycin A1 inhibits the infection process. Quantification of the number of intra-and extracellular infectious particles via plaque assay confirmed this. For both strains, an extreme low or undetectable amount of intracellular and extracellular viral particles was measured ( Figure 1C ,D). This was further confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy of ZIKV-infected cells using an envelope protein-specific antibody. In contrast to the control, no ZIKV-positive cells were observed when treated with bafilomycin A1 ( Figure 1E ). Concerning the SH-SY5Y cells, the amount of intracellular and extracellular ZIKV RNA was significantly decreased at 24 hpi after bafilomycin A1 treatment. However, unlike for A549, it was still possible to detect a considerable amount of viral RNA ( Figure S1A ,B). However, confocal laser scanning microscopy of ZIKV-infected cells revealed no ZIKV-positive cells after treatment for both time points analyzed ( Figure S1C ). The effect of bafilomycin A1 on cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by determination of the metabolic activity via PrestoBlue assay. A minor reduction in cell viability could be observed after 24 h after treatment, whereas after 48 h, there was a decrease of approximately 0.4-fold ( Figure S2D ,E).",

However, a considerable amount of infectious viral particles was still detectable after 24 and 48 hpi when cells were infected with the French Polynesia strain and when compared to the control ( Figure 2C ,D). In contrast to this, a very strong reduction in the amount of released infectious viral particles was observed after treatment for all three time points analyzed and for both strains ( Figure 2E ,F). Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy showed a lower amount of ZIKV-positive cells when treated with bafilomycin A1 in comparison to the untreated control ( Figure 2G ). To control whether the observed effect of bafilomycin A1 on ZIKV-infected cells is not a result of cytotoxicity, the metabolic activity was measured by PrestoBlue assay. Only after 72 h of treatment could a slight reduction be detected ( Figure 2H ). As the inhibitory effect of bafilomycin A1 on the number of released viral particles and on viral entry is much more pronounced compared to the 0.3-fold decrease in the metabolic activity, it can be assumed that the observed effects of bafilomycin A1 treatment on the viral life cycle are not due to an impact on cellular viability.",

At this time point, almost all of the cells (infection reached its peak, as shown in Figure 2G ) are infected. The treatment was applied for 24 h and the cell lysates and the respective cell culture supernatants were harvested at 72 hpi. Due to the short duration of the treatment, 50 nM was the concentration chosen for these experiments to ensure the maximum effect of the compound. In these assays, DMSO was included as vehicle control due to the high amount of chemical utilized to perform the experiments. For both strains, treatment with bafilomycin A1 leads to an increase in the amount of intracellular viral genomes, while the number of released viral genomes is significantly reduced for the Uganda strain when compared to the control ( Figure 3A,B) . Quantification of the number of intracellular infectious viral particles revealed that for both strains bafilomycin A1 does not lead to a significant change, although analysis of the supernatant unveiled a strong inhibition of the release of viral particles ( Figure 3C,D) . To further investigate the effect of bafilomycin A1 on the ZIKV maturation, cell culture supernatants were analyzed by Western blot and the prM protein/pr peptide was detected. Analysis of the cell culture supernatants harvested at 24 hpi from Section 3.2 ( Figure 2E ,F) revealed that the pr peptide could not be detected when the infected cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 ( Figure 3E ). Furthermore, the amount of intracellular ZIKV prM slightly decreased after treatment ( Figure 3E) . Moreover, the cell culture supernatants harvested at 72 hpi confirmed the same results as in the ones shown in Figure 3C ,D. For the French Polynesia strain, a hardly detectable amount of the pr peptide was detected, while for the Uganda strain, a strong reduction in the amount of pr peptide could be observed ( Figure 3F ). Regarding the amount of intracellular ZIKV prM, no significant changes were visible for the French Polynesia strain, whereas for the Uganda strain a small accumulation could be observed after bafilomycin A1 treatment ( Figure 3F ). The effect of 50 nM bafilomycin A1 on cell viability was measured by PrestoBlue assay to control the specificity of the observed results. Although a minor decrease in cell viability was detected after treatment, the effect on infectiveness is much more pronounced than this reduction ( Figure 3G ). The same study was investigated in SH-SY5Y cells. However, a fully established infection could not be accomplished at 48 hpi. Quantification of the amount of intra-and extracellular ZIKV genomes shows a considerable reduction in ZIKV RNA after bafilomycin A1 treatment ( Figure S2A-C) .",

Nevertheless, after 72 hpi the intracellular virus titer for the French Polynesia infected cells did not significantly differ from the U18666A-treated cells. A possible explanation could be that at this time point only a low production of viral particles occurs due to the cytopathic effect in infected untreated cells, which results in the release of viral particles from the dead cells. In the U18666A-treated cells, the infection is attenuated and therefore, a less pronounced cytopathic effect occurs.

A gradual accumulation of cholesterol was monitored by the dye filipin complex that binds to free cholesterol.

Although antiviral activity was already visible at 24 hpi, characterized by the lower number of ZIKV-positive cells after treatment, the maximum of cholesterol accumulation was observed at 72 hpi ( Figure 7A,B) . In addition, the same samples were analyzed at a higher magnification to investigate whether the treatment could influence the intracellular localization and distribution of the E protein. After U18666A treatment, an evident change in the subcellular distribution and amount in the cell of the envelope protein (green signal) could be visualized ( Figure 7C,D) . In U18666A-treated cells, most of the intensively stained large green structures disappeared and a more dispersed staining could be observed. Besides the clear impact on the amount and distribution of the structural protein E, the effect of the treatment on the amount of a non-structural protein (NS1) was investigated by Western blot analysis. The amount of NS1 was reduced after U18666A treatment for both strains and at all time points investigated, but especially more pronounced after 48 and 72 hpi. This is in accordance with the RNA data shown in Figure 6A ,B. The efficacy of the treatment was reflected by the increase in the amount of the lysosome-associated protein 2 (LAMP2) and p62 ( Figure 7E ). In addition, the functionality of the inhibitor was reflected by the formation of multilamellar bodies (MLBs) and lipid droplets as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy of ultra-thin sections of U18666A-treated cells ( Figure 7F ).

However, the amount of released infectious viral particles for all time points was practically zero. This indicates that, in addition to its inhibitory effect on the entry process, bafilomycin A1 also affects the release of viral particles. At 24 hpi, the presence of viral genomes in the supernatant of bafilomycin A1-treated cells, but no significant amount of infectious viral particles suggests that the genomes measured represent defective/unprocessed virons or naked capsids/genomes. The observed inhibitory effect in our experiments seems to be in contrast to data published by Cortese et al. [28] In this study, no inhibitory effect of bafilomycin A1 treatment was observed when this substance was applied 3 h post-infection. However, the concentration of 2.5 nM used in this study could be below the concentration required for an efficient inhibition of the V-ATPase that is described with 10 nM [41] . Moreover, there is a difference in the cell culture model. In the study of Cortese et al., Huh7 cells were used and they might differ in their capacity to metabolize xenobiotics. The inhibitory effect of bafilomycin A1 on the release of ZIKV was further confirmed on a fully established infection after 48 hpi. Once more, the number of released infectious viral particles was strongly decreased, while again the amount of released viral RNA was less affected, which reflects the release of non-infectious particles or naked genomes. During ZIKV-morphogenesis, processing of the prM membrane protein by a furin-like protease occurs, as described for a variety of other flaviviruses [21, 22, 42] . Changing the pH of the TGN compartment by bafilomycin A1 strongly impairs the activity of this enzyme and could affect the conformational changes required for proteolytic processing. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed that the formation of the pr-peptide, which reflects the processing of the prM protein, is prevented by bafilomycin A1. The quantification of the released viral genomes indicates that there is still a significant release of viral genomes in case of the cells treated with 50 nM bafilomycin A1 for 24 h before harvest ( Figure 3B ). We interpret this as the release per se is not strongly affected and, in accordance with this, no strong intracellular accumulation of prM is observed ( Figure 3F ). However, plaque assay data reveal that the infectivity of the released particles is strongly decreased ( Figure 3D ). We hypothesize that this could be due to an impaired processing of the prM to pr fragment that is reflected by the Western blot analysis shown in Figure 3F . The specificity of the observed effects was controlled by a viability assay that showed only a moderate reduction in the metabolic activity at 72 h. This decrease of approximately 30% is much less pronounced as compared to the almost complete loss of viral RNA and infectious viral particles.",

Indeed, we observed that bafilomycinA1 impairs the ZIKV-dependent induction of autophagy. However, modulation of autophagy either by 3-MA or by rapamycin had no effect on the number of infected cells. This suggests that the bafilomycin-dependent interference with autophagy is not primarily causative for the observed effects in our study. This seems to be in contrast to studies that describe a direct effect of autophagy modulation on the ZIKV life cycle, but the experimental settings, including the incubation periods and concentrations, were different from our study [15, 29, 44] .",

            "text": "To further gain insight on the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, the intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor U18666A was used. In this study, the effect of U18666A on the ZIKV life cycle was investigated for the first time. Prolonged U18666A treatment results in the inhibition of the functionality of late endosomes/MVBs and lysosomes, as a consequence of the accumulation of cholesterol in these organelles [31] . This was experimentally verified by the increased number of lipid droplets and the formation of non-functional lysosomes, the so-called multilamellar bodies (MLBs). Although U18666A could significantly diminish the amount of intracellular and extracellular viral genomes and infectious viral particles for all time points analyzed, the infection persisted until 72 hpi. Nevertheless, at 72 hpi, the number of intracellular infectious viral particles in French Polynesia-infected cells was approximately the same as when treated with U18666A. This can be explained by the fact that this strain has a higher cytopathic effect and causes significant cell death after 48 hpi and before the wash at 64 hpi. Thus, the virus titers are very similar to the ones measured at 24 hpi. Since the treatment slows down, the typical infection kinetic, a higher number of intracellular infectious viral particles could be detected. The persistence of ZIKV infection until 72 hpi after U18666A treatment could be easily observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, where ZIKV-positive cells were still found at this time point. Even in the presence of the U18666A treatment, the number of ZIKV-positive cells increased from 24 to 48 hpi. These findings might indicate that the main effect is on viral replication. However, from these experiments, we could not exclude completely that this compound does not have a minor effect on viral entry. Moreover, the intracellular localization and distribution of the ZIKV envelope protein also changed after treatment. In U18666A-treated cells, the viral envelope protein was found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm instead of concentrated in this dot-like compartment. These data support the possible effect of U18666A on viral replication.",

[32, 35] . To clarify this point, infected cells (MOI = 0.1 or 1) were pre-treated for 24 h and analyzed by RT-qPCR. Different amounts of viral input led to the same fold-reduction (0.7) after 16 hpi, suggesting that the effect of U18666A might be on viral replication. These findings were further confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, where a considerable number of ZIKV-positive cells could be observed after pre-treatment with U18666A, and by analysis of the replication of a luciferase reporter virus. If the effect was on viral entry, it would only be possible to observe, in each cell, a single viral particle and not a significant amount and distribution of the envelope protein, as described by Poh et al.-U18666A trapped dengue virus in late endosomes [32] . Interestingly, for other flaviviruses, such as for hepatitis C virus, Elgner et al. showed that the replication was not affected by U18666A treatment as the number of intracellular viral genomes and the amount of NS3 and NS5A remained constant [33] . Here, we also investigated the effect of U18666A on the amount of a non-structural protein (NS1) and the envelope protein. Western blot analysis showed that, the amount of NS1 and E protein was decreased after U18666A treatment. Once more, the data strongly points towards an effect at the replication level. The inhibition of the trafficking of intracellular cholesterol by U18666A and its accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes has repercussions in the membrane composition and fluidity of the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore, most likely affects the formation of the replication complex. There are reports describing the impact of U18666A on the replication of flaviviruses, such as HCV and DENV. Although there are differences in the structural organization of the replication factories and the formation of a membranous web structure, there seems to be parallels that make them accessible for an inhibition by U18666A [45] [46] [47] .",
