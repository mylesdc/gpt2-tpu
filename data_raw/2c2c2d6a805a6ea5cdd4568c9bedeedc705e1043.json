            "text": "Immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) is one of the highest induced genes in macrophages under pro-inflammatory conditions. Its function has been recently described: it codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1 induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic approach of both computational and experimental methods, PLOS ONE | we here shed more light on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels.",

Macrophages trigger defensive pathways upon stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) [1, 2] . Previous studies have shown that mouse macrophages under pro-inflammatory conditions, such as bacterial infections or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, highly express immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) [3, 4] . Recently, we demonstrated the active role of IRG1 in antimicrobial responses linking metabolism to immunity [5] : immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of cis-aconitic acid to itaconic acid (also known as methylenesuccinic acid) during the TCA cycle. Itaconic acid is an organic compound that inhibits isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, a savior pathway for bacterial growth under nutrient-deprived conditions. For the first time, we also demonstrated IRG1 expression and itaconic acid production in LPS-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)-derived macrophages [5] . Thus, IRG1/CAD contributes to the host immune response against bacterial invasion providing an additional support to the innate immune system.",

            "text": "In addition to our findings, Irg1 was also previously shown to be expressed in mouse macrophages under different TLR ligand stimulations [3, 6] and microbial infections [4, 7] . High upregulation of Irg1 was observed in the lungs of mice when infected with influenza A virus, thus showing its induction also under viral infections [8] . In a different context, Irg1 was found to be highly expressed in the uterine luminal epithelium of the mouse during the early stages of pregnancy due to the synergistic regulation by progesterone and estradiol mediated by the protein kinase C pathway [9, 10] . IRG1 was also reported to be highly expressed in PBMCs of septic patients where it fosters endotoxin tolerance by enhancing A20 expression via reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling [11] . Apart from mouse and human, IRG1 is also expressed in other species under microbial infections. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), when infected with Salmonella species, irg1 is specifically expressed by macrophage-lineage cells and is cooperatively regulated by glucocorticoid and JAK/STAT signaling pathways [12] . Furthermore, it was shown that irg1 is a key component responsible for the production of mitochondrial ROS augmenting the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Hence, in zebrafish, IRG1/CAD additionally contributes to immune responses by the production of ROS [12] . Taken together, these findings demonstrate a pivotal role of IRG1/CAD in the immune metabolism axis connecting the immune system with cellular metabolism through the production of itaconic acid and ROS.",

The regulation of Irg1 expression was reported on several findings, which are rather contrasting, such as de novo protein synthesis independent [3] and dependent [13] , MyD88-independent [14] and dependent [7] , TRIF-independent [15] , TLR2-and TLR4-independent [13] . Interestingly, Irg1 was highly induced when stimulated with IFN\u03b3 alone or in combination with TNF\u03b1 and it was shown that the vast majority of the murine IRG1/CAD protein was found in the mitochondrial fraction [6] . All the above experiments differ by cell types, the nature of the stimuli and perturbing compound concentrations. It is highly likely that IRG1 is regulated by a complex transcriptional machinery responding to cellular environments and external stimuli. Hence, it is important to unravel its transcriptional machinery to understand its role and expression under specific inflammatory conditions.",

Inferring regulatory interactions linked to IRG1 can contribute to identify the major regulatory elements involved in the induction of IRG1. There are three main GRN inference approaches, which are widely used. The first is based on existing literature information which use natural language processing algorithms and manual curation to mine scientific articles [18] [19] [20] . The second approach is purely data-driven without any prior information. These category of methods infer the regulatory networks directly from multi-omics data based on the underlying conditional dependency structures such as co-expression [16] , mutual information [21] or regression [22, 23] among the genes. The third category of methods uses predictive modeling and experimental approaches, such as ChIP-Seq, to infer transcription factor-DNA (TF-DNA) binding sites (TFBS) and motifs [24, 25] .",

However, due to the course of dimensionality, most of them suffer from a high number of false positive interactions, thus making the subsequent network analysis of GRNs more elusive. To this end, in this context, we used an integrated algorithm, which leverages on the information from all the three different category of methods (i.e. literature, TFBS and data-driven) to infer the regulatory network of IRG1. This algorithm, with some minor modifications from [26] , is used to infer the GRN of IRG1 from literature and TFBS, and to prune inconsistent interactions by contextualizing the model to predict differential expression from genome-wide expression arrays. Putative transcriptional regulators of IRG1 were hypothesized from the resulting GRN and tested using siRNA-mediated gene silencing experiments in mouse and human macrophages under LPS stimulation.",

For the experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Escherichia coli 055:B5, Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 10ng/mL. Primary monocytes were extracted from the blood samples of anonymous healthy male donors, donated by the Luxembourgish Red Cross (http://www.croix-rouge.lu/).

For this purpose, the blood was diluted 1:1 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) in falcon tubes and was transferred to Leucosep tubes (Greiner bio one, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria) filled with 15ml of Ficoll (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania). After a 10 minute centrifugation (1000 g at room temperature without break), the PBMCs layer was collected and the CD14+ monocytes were isolated by using the MACS1 technology (magnetic separation) from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). PBMCs were mixed with 200\u03bcL of CD14 MicroBeads and incubated for 30min at 4\u00b0C on a rotating platform followed by magnetic separation using LScolumn.

The minimum size of nuclei was set to 1000 pixels. For the detection of cell covered regions, the three channels were summed up and low pass filtered with a gaussian filter of size 50 and sigma 20. Resulting images were thresholded by the first quartile of pixel values. To detect single cell areas, a watershed algorithm was applied to the euclidian distance transform of the nucleus mask. Mitochondria were segmented via a combination of local thresholding and segmentation of non-uniformly corrected mitochondria images. According to the local thresholding algorithm, mitochondrial pixel assignment requires a raw mitochondrial image, low pass filtered with a gaussian filter of size 5 and sigma 2 to be brighter than the same image convolved with an average filter of size 5. For non-uniform correction mitochondria channel images average filtered with a structuring element of size 50 were subtracted from original mitochondria images. For segmentation these corrected images were thresholded to a pixel intensity of 10. For connected components confirmed by both rules the minimum volume was set to 10 pixels.

Further, using the simple paths, the importance of TFs were established using a gene essentiality metric score. This score defines the importance of a particular gene in propagating the signal from the ligand stimulus to the target gene. The score ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being the most essential gene and 0 being nonessential. However, the score cannot be 0 for any gene as all the genes are at least participating in one of the paths between LPS-IRG1.

In order to investigate IRG1 expression over time following a pro-inflammatory stimulus, we analysed its expression levels at different time points following LPS activation. The results show that IRG1, similarly to the corresponding mouse gene [5] , is expressed at the highest levels at 6-9 hours in both monocytes and macrophages (S1 Fig) and that its expression is already significantly induced after 40 minutes in human PBMCs-derived macrophages as well as after 20 minutes in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (S2 Fig).

We adopted a similar approach for both the murine and human genes. The mouse analysis resulted in an Irg1 upstream network containing 70 nodes and 3936 edges. In parallel, the interactions (signed and directed) related to the biological process of LPS stimulation in macrophages were inferred from Pathway Studio and resulted in a LPS downstream network with 615 nodes and 1278 edges. As expected, we did not obtain Irg1 as one of the nodes in this network reflecting the lack of specific information about the transcriptional regulation of Irg1 following an LPS treatment. Taking the union of all the interactions, these two networks were then merged into a single network.

As a proof of concept, we first silenced Cebpb, our second top scoring transcriptional regulator. Indeed, CEBPB was already previously described to be a transcription factor responsible for irg1 induction in zebrafish [12] . Silencing of Cebpb resulted in 55% and 45% decrease of the Cebpb mRNA levels when compared to the non-targeting siRNA in unstimulated and LPS-treated cells, respectively (S7 Fig). Correspondingly, Irg1 expression was decreased by 69% and 16% in Cebpb silenced cells as compared to non-targeting siRNA in unstimulated and LPS treated cells, respectively (S7 Fig). Thus, these results confirm the previous findings in zebrafish, showing that CEBPB is a transcriptional regulator of Irg1 in mouse macrophages, as also predicted by our analysis. Silencing of Irf1, our first top scoring transcription factor, resulted in 55% and 45% decrease of the Irf1 mRNA levels when compared to the non-targeting siRNA in unstimulated and LPStreated cells, respectively (Fig 6A) .

In parallel, proteins were extracted from the cells 4 hours after LPS stimulation. As expected, IRF1 and IRG1/CAD proteins were not detectable in control conditions, while they were detected in LPS-stimulated cells in both siRNA Irf1 and non-targeting siRNA conditions. In accordance with gene expression results, IRF1 and IRG1/CAD expression levels both decreased in Irf1 silenced cells as compared to non-targeting siRNA transfected cells following LPS stimulation ( Fig 6C) . As IRG1/CAD has been recently described to enzymatically convert cis-aconitic acid into itaconic acid [5] , we next measured itaconic acid levels in Irf1 silenced cells. Indeed, itaconic acid amounts in siRNA Irf1 cells were decreased by 11% in unstimulated cells and by 20% in LPS-treated cells when compared to non-targeting siRNA treated cells (Fig 6D and 6E) .",

Transfected macrophages were then stimulated with LPS and RNA was extracted after 6 hours. Differently from mouse macrophages, human primary macrophages do not have a detectable basal level of IRG1 expression, thus we only analysed gene expression levels following LPS exposure. As a result of IRF1 silencing, which held a decrease of its expression levels, as an average of four donors, by 54% (Fig 7A) , IRG1 expression levels were correspondingly reduced by approximately 50% under LPS conditions (Fig 7B) in siRNA IRF1 transfected cells when compared to non-targeting siRNA treated cells. In order to gain additional support for IRF1 as a direct regulator of the IRG1 locus, we overlaid the putative top scoring IRF1 binding motifs identified in our MATCH\u2122 analysis (S2 Table) with open chromatin regions in the human IRG1 locus in PBMCs and blood CD14+ monocytes using publicly available ENCODE data on UCSC Genome Browser (S8 Fig). The results show that, in the human monocyte lineage, IRF1 binding sites in the IRG1 locus are associated with active chromatin marks, such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which mark active/poised enhancers and which could represent putative IRF1 binding sites responsible for IRG1 expression.",

            "text": "We have recently revealed that IRG1 codes for the enzyme IRG1/CAD which catalyses the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate, a TCA cycle intermediate, to itaconic acid [5] . This metabolite inhibits isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt [35, 36] . We demonstrated that silencing Irg1 in murine macrophages decreases itaconic acid levels resulting in a defective antimicrobial activity towards different bacterial infections. Thus, we showed that IRG1/CAD, by the production of itaconic acid from a TCA cycle intermediate, plays an essential role in innate immune responses. Here, we additionally show that IRG1 is not only expressed by human macrophages, but also by monocytes as well as by dendritic cells. Thus, due to the important role of IRG1/CAD at the interface between the innate immune system and the central carbon metabolism, we aimed to shed more light into its expression and transcriptional regulation under inflammatory conditions. For this, we designed an integrative approach of computational and experimental methods to identify the transcriptional regulators of IRG1 in mammalian macrophages, where the notion \"co-expression implies co-regulation\" is satisfied [37] . Transcription factors play a pivotal role in modulating gene expression and thus contribute to the overall regulation of biological processes. In order to identify the transcriptional regulators responsible for IRG1 induction, we used a weight matrix-based tool for searching putative transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences: MATCH TM [25] . This tool uses the matrix library collected in TRANSFAC 1 , thus providing the possibility to search for a large variety of different transcription factor binding sites [25] . The main bottleneck in using these tools is the high amount of false positives generated due to the short and degenerate sequence motifs of transcription factors. A comprehensive method is hence needed to increase the specificity. With our algorithm, we eliminated non-cell type/condition specific transcription factors, thus rendering the biological validation appropriate. Though our method could potentially identify the transcriptional regulators of any given gene, it presents some limitations. For instance, to contextualize our networks, we exclusively considered DEGs from microarrays data, although some transcription factors are phosphorylated in order to be activated and shuttled into the nucleus to subsequently act as transcription factors. Thus, in follow-up studies it would be valuable to add an additional layer of information on top of the transcriptomic data, such as phosphoproteomics data. This could allow contextualizing the generated networks not only taking into account gene expression data, but also the phosphorylation data of various regulating proteins.",

            "text": "From our contextualized murine and human networks, we identified potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1 in macrophages. Of interest, our mouse and human analysis provide insights for the identification of species-specific regulators for IRG1 induction under LPS activation. Although the human data were obtained from primary cells, while the mouse analysis was conducted using the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, it is tempting to speculate that the transcriptional machinery inducing IRG1 expression, with the exception of IRF1, is mostly species-specific, as highlighted by the different transcriptional regulators identified in the two species (Table 1) . Experimentally, we confirmed that CEBPB in mouse and IRF1 in both species represent positive targets which modulate IRG1 expression. We used CEBPB as a proof of concept for our method, since we predicted it in our ranking and it has been previously shown to be a transcriptional regulator of irg1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio). CEBPB, as a primary response gene, is known as a transcriptional regulator of the acute phase response [38] . In our experimental conditions in murine macrophages, Cebpb is highly up-regulated under LPS stimulation and, when silenced, Irg1 expression levels are decreased. These results are in agreement with those obtained in zebrafish, thus highlighting CEBPB as a transcriptional regulator of Irg1 in both the species. IRF1 is referred to as a positive transcription factor as it induces several genes, which are important in regulating several immunological and physiological functions in mammalian cells. Irf1 is also transcriptionally activated by several pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogens [39, 40] . IRF1 selectively regulates specific sets of genes depending on the cell type and the appropriate response needed to counter the external stimuli, thus having its function driven by cell-type specific factors. IRF1 mainly activates interferons (IFNs) and IFN inducible genes. Some of the targets of IRF1 which are known to play a role in host defence are IFN (\u03b1, \u03b2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin 12 (IL12), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), IL15, caspase 1-7 and lysyl oxidase [17, 41] . Among these, iNOS is one of the most studied downstream targets of IRF1. The enzyme iNOS catalyses the production of nitric oxide (NO) which is essential for the antimicrobial and anti-tumorigenic properties of macrophages. NO is a biologically active intermediate produced by the cells using L-arginine, an urea cycle intermediate, as the substrate [17, 42] . Increased NO production correlates with resistance towards invading pathogens [43] . Several studies showed that the silencing of Irf1 diminishes the expression of iNOS and the production of NO, thereby attenuating the antibacterial and antiviral activities and thus worsening the severity of the disease [43] [44] [45] . iNOS is induced upon stimulation by IL1, IL12, TNF, IFN\u03b3 and LPS via IRF1 [46] . Nevertheless, IFN\u03b3 and LPS are the major and necessary stimulants to induce iNOS expression and NO production in murine macrophages [47] . Its transcriptional induction following LPS stimulation occurs after the synthesis of IFNs and the JAK/STAT signalling pathway [48] . iNOS promoter requires the dimeric binding of IRF1 for the full cytokine activation. Hence, other transcription factors, like NF\u03baB, that are induced by other cytokines, may cooperate with IRF1 to induce the full transcriptional activity of iNOS [49] . IRF1 protein is highly unstable with a half-life of 30 minutes [50] and LPSinduced NO production can be abrogated by inhibiting the translation of Irf1 by 10-hydroxytrans-2-decenoic acid, a medium chain fatty acid [51] . IRF1 is serine-phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). Mutation of these tyrosine residues inhibit the induction of Irf1 expression [52, 53] . It was reported earlier that LPS induction of Irg1 in macrophages is mediated via the PKC pathway [3] . Thus the PKC pathway may be responsible for Irg1 induction through IRF1.",

Of interest, Mycobacteria infection studies in IRF1 knock-out mice revealed that IRF1 is required for the mycobacteria induced granuloma necrosis. Gene expression analysis of infected mice resulted in the grouping of differentially expressed genes into different clusters based on the dependence of gene expression on IFN\u03b3 or IRF1. Irg1 was classified to the cluster of genes whose expression is mostly dependent on Irf1, but less on IFN\u03b3 [55] . In line with the results obtained with Mycobacteria infections, our results show that IRF1 expression is highly up-regulated under LPS exposure and that IRF1 silencing induces a significant decrease of IRG1 expression levels in both human and murine macrophages. Upon TLR activation by external stimuli, such as LPS, IRF1 was shown to interact with MYD88 adaptor molecule to translocate into the nucleus and induce the expression of several genes to mediate immune responses [56] . The analysis of transcription start site (TSS) distributions of immune related genes by Liang et al. classified Irf1 as a gene dependent on MYD88 pathway along with Irg1 which was stated as an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) element [57] . However, Irg1 was previously shown to be expressed independently from MYD88 or TRIF adaptor molecules [14, 15] , thus demonstrating that additional pathways regulating Irg1 expression independent from IRF1 and MYD88 could exist.",

Thus, from our results, it is tempting to conclude that IRF1 regulates these processes also through the induction of Irg1 and itaconic acid production. To this end, iNOS and IRG1 can be considered as the gene twins, regulated by IRF1, which contribute to the host protection towards pathogen invasion through the production of effector molecules, such as NO and itaconic acid, respectively. Of interest, in contrast to mouse, iNOS expression and NO production in human cellular systems have been an argument of discussion by cellular biologists and immunologists since a long time [59] . Even though there were reports showing low levels of iNOS and NO in activated human cells [60] [61] [62] , it was argued that these results neither show the functional pathway of NO production, as through L-arginine in mouse, nor describe the precise experimental details, such as cell types and culture conditions [63] [64] [65] . In accordance with this argument, accordingly to our microarrays data, we did not detect iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated human macrophages, while its expression was highly up-regulated in mouse cells. However, taking the side of the discussion that human macrophages do not express iNOS, IRF1 plays a crucial role in mediating antimicrobial responses through IRG1 gene regulation in human immune cells.",
