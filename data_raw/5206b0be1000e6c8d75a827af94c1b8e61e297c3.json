            "text": "The spread of infectious disease epidemics is mediated by human travel. Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult.",

Understanding the spatiotemporal spread of emerging infections requires detailed information on the epidemiological coupling of human populations. Such coupling is mediated by travel. Hence recent years have seen human travel data incorporated into models of respiratory disease spread to explain the observed patterns of spatial spread [4] , and to inform contingency planning [5, 6, 7] .",

In order to find predictors of the distance travelled to school or workplace we fitted linear regression models to the data, adjusting the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters for the clustering by households in the dataset. We used the logarithm of the distance to the school or workplace as the independent variable. For those individuals with a reported distance of 0 km we used ln(uniform[0,0.5[)) instead. Potential independent variables are age, sex, family size, registration status, frequency of travel outside the study area and whether or not they live in a rural area (Huangshan) or are migrant workers (Shenzhen). For students, age was categorised by type of school, whereas for employees we used 10-year age bands, with those below 20 and those over 60 merged. Family size was classified into small (, = 3) and large (.3) families. To decide which variables and interactions to include into the final model, we fitted models with all possible variable combinations, and up to two interaction terms, as well as all possible combinations of interaction terms for all combinations of up to 4 variables. The model with the lowest value of the Bayesian information criterion BIC~{2 ln Lzk ln N [9] , where k is the number of parameters in the model and N is the number of observations, was selected as final model.

Here, we had data on only two different origins, and the number of observed journeys was small compared to the possible number of destinations within Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao, preventing the robust analysis of a full gravity model that would have described the spatial anisotropy given by the population density. We therefore binned the distances into bins of logarithmic width and summed over all destinations within each distance category. As the origin was not known precisely, but only as a point somewhere within each study area, we also integrated over the area of origin, weighted by the local population density.

The dormitories provide very crowded accommodation with typically 8-12 people sleeping in the same room and many more assemble in the communal areas for eating and other pursuits [14] . While these dormitories are a potential focus of disease spread, the commuting distances (up to 7 km) for the migrant workers are the shortest observed in all datasets. We would therefore not expect this population to play a major role in the spatial spread of acute disease (such as influenza) themselves, but only via contact to other parts of the population who have longer commuting distances. However, if the migrants travel to their home provinces on a seasonal basis (which was not detected in this survey), they might indeed play a larger role in the long distance spread of chronic infectious diseases such as HIV or TB.",

Certainly we find in Shenzhen that those with residency permits have larger commuting distances, whereas the shortest distances are found in the Shenzhen migrant worker population. In Huangshan, commuting distances tend to be larger in the rural area. The dependence of commuting distance on age, with shorter distances for older people, is interesting and could be explained by a number of mechanisms. For instance, it is possible that over long timescales people change jobs or move if a more convenient opportunity arises, and that in this process the commuting distances tend to settle down to a more local distribution. It is also conceivable that over time there has been a shift in attitudes with younger people being more accepting of longer commuting distances.",

As people travelling long distances on a regular basis would be expected to contribute most to the spatial spread, the tail of the distance distribution has most impact on the potential spread of diseases. The distributions of commuting distances for both Shenzhen and Huangshan are considerably more local than those from western counties (UK, US [17, 18] , see Figure 8 ), where power laws or exponential distributions have been used to model distance distributions [4, 8, 10, 19] . There are however massive differences between the two Chinese cities with the distance distribution for Huangshan city being very local, with no one in our datasets commuting further than 30 km, whereas the distribution found in Shenzhen is comparable to, albeit a little more local than that from Thailand [6] . Possible reasons for these differences include a weaker infrastructure or affordability of travelling. The hukou system, which officially requires people to work and live where they are registered, could also explain much of the locality seen in commuting patterns. While the patterns of occasional journeys observed might have a smaller impact on disease spread than commuting distances, due to the lower frequency of journeys, infrequent but very long distance trips are likely to play an important role in spreading diseases between regions, particularly in areas like Huangshan, where commuting is limited to very short distances. This paper has presented the first known data on human travel patterns within China. The striking differences between travel distances seen in Huangshan and Shenzhen point to substantial heterogeneity in travel behaviour within China at its current state of development. It is important to take these regional differences into account when modelling the likely speed of geographic spread of an infectious disease outbreak and in planning for containment or control of such outbreaks. Ongoing modelling work is using these data to examine the feasibility of containment of a lethal influenza pandemic in different areas of China.",
