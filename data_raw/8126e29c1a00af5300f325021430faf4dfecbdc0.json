The effective reproduction number is always less than or equal to the basic reproduction number and typically declines gradually as a disease spreads through the population and collective immunity increases. The effective reproduction number was calculated using an adaptation of the method of Bettencourt and co-workers [9] [10] [11] to allow for imported cases and a distributed serial interval. The adaptation consists of cases being partitioned into local (L) and imported (M) cases and these are tracked in the data so that the new imported cases are not considered to be locally acquired infections and hence are not attributed to infection from previous local cases.",

Implicit in the adaptation used here is the assumption that the imported cases spend their infectious period in the jurisdiction of interest which is reasonable given those cases where reported in that jurisdiction.

Faster convergence and tighter bounds on R are obtained if R is calculated using a weighted sum of L and M stretching back in time beyond the serial interval. The weighting used is the temporal distribution of the serial interval, taken to be gamma distributed here, which weights earlier days relative to how likely the serial interval was to be that long.

Inputs to the model were a fixed reproduction number (R) and a serial interval distribution (f(t), t = 1,\u2026M) as described above. New cases at time t were sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean RS(t)gf(t)I(t2t), where S(t) is the fraction of the population susceptible and I(t) are the number of infected individuals at time t. Initially, there were one million susceptible individuals and one infective case was introduced at time zero. We performed 1,000 simulations for each pair of values, and recorded the mean and standard deviation over these simulations. The simulations were not run beyond a total of 5,000 cases, so the results are insensitive to the initial population size, which was chosen large enough so that susceptible depletion was not an issue. Due to the stochastic nature of the method, not all simulations result in an established outbreak, with some resulting in what is known as stochastic die out [19] .

One of the most likely sources of heterogeneity for this data arises from age structure [17] . The stochastic SEIR model described above is homogeneous with respect to age structure. This may be a limitation of the model. We therefore tested the impact of age heterogeneity using an alternative model with different reproduction numbers for adults and children (but with the overall reproduction number equal to that of our basic model). In order to test the impact of very high levels of heterogeneity, we assumed that the reproduction number for children was twice that of adults, due to heightened mixing between children and lack of prior immunity. The structured model estimated a reduction in 20-25% in the days required to reach the case numbers. In particular, for the intermediate case of a reproduction number of 1.4 and mean serial interval of 2.8 days, the delay was reduced from 33 to 26 days. The Victorian data could not be reproduced with this agestructured heterogeneity without using unrealistically large values of the reproduction number. The same was true of the stochastic SEIR model described above and other common simulation models such as deterministic SIR and SEIR type models [24] . We concluded that, although model structure influenced the estimate of the delay, even very high levels of heterogeneity had a relatively minor impact relative to the effect of the reproduction number or the serial interval, which are the dominant factors in determining the speed of the spread of the outbreak.",

Symptom onset for this patient occurred two days after boarding, consistent with a prodromal infection at the time of embarkation. Despite recognition of numerous passengers with influenza-like illness when the ship berthed in Sydney on 25 May, public health authorities allowed passengers to disperse into the community because the ship had not visited any port where there were confirmed cases of pandemic influenza. Retrospectively, it appears plausible that the Melbourne passenger who joined the cruise on 16 May 2009 with prodromal infection may have been the source of the shipboard pH1N1 outbreak.",

Amongst the first 12 cases in China, diagnosed between 11 and 25 May, one was a traveller from Melbourne who had arrived in Beijing on 21 May [25] , only one day after Victoria's first case was confirmed.",

Estimates of R in WA were consistently around 1.2 and never above 1.4. By contrast, initial estimates of R in Victoria approached 3, followed by a rapid -and implausible -decrease over a very short period of time. This precipitous fall cannot be explained satisfactorily by potential reduced transmission associated with early control interventions (such as partial school closure, t isolation and treatment of cases, and chemoprophylaxis and home quarantine of contacts), or depletion of susceptible people within the population. For instance, it took 20 days for the estimated value of R for the 1918-19 pandemic in San Francisco to fall from ,2.4 to ,1.2 [9] . We suggest the high initial value of R = 2.7 in the Victorian pandemic and the dramatic decline in 9 days is more likely explained by unrecognised cases due to an earlier commencement of the epidemic in Victoria.",

Identification of pH1N1 virus from Mexican patients was in response to this concern. However, the identification of the virus in the US at around the same time was serendipitous, following the identification of two influenza A viruses, one from a study on a point-of-care test and the other from a routine surveillance system, that could not be sub-typed [2] . Concern rose in the US when it was realised that the Mexican and US viruses were essentially identical [2] .",

One phylogenetic analysis suggests that the pandemic virus may have entered the human population between November 2008 and March 2009 [20] while a second study suggests the virus may have been causing human infections as early as September 2008 [37] . Widespread unrecognised community transmission causing mild infections may have been occurring in Mexico for some weeks or months, eventually leading to recognition of a cluster of severe pneumonia in a sub-group of susceptible young adults in April 2009. This cluster would have represented the apex of the infectious pyramid.",

In those weeks specific testing was targeted at incoming travellers from North America, with no hint that the virus was already circulating in the Victorian community.",

We suggest that a relatively low clinical attack rate -but a much higher infection rate -by a virus causing generally mild disease would allow community transmission of the virus to go unrecognised for many weeks.

For a representative intermediate estimate of R = 1.4 and an intermediate value of the MSI = 2.8 days, the average length of time to obtain the actual case numbers reported on 29 May is 33 days. This is contrasted with the actual time from the first reported case in Victoria of just 9 days.Figure 2shows a typical example of one of the simulation results with an inputted value of R = 1.4 and MSI = 2.8 days and the reported daily number of cases. Also shown are the calculated effective reproduction numbers for the simulated and real data. The deviation away from 1.4 early in the simulated data is due to the low number of cases. Over this range of reproductive numbers and mean serial intervals the pandemic commencement date in Victoria is postulated to be somewhere between 14 April (R = 1.4, MSI = 3.5) and 9 May (R = 1.6, MSI = 2.5).",

This suggests there was no sustained local transmission up to that date and that imported cases out-numbered local cases. From 24 June onwards the calculated values for R ranged between 1 and 1.4, with an average value of 1.2, and declined almost to 1.0 in the latter part of July, which corresponded with the peak of pH1N1 notifications in WA (Figure 4).",
