Antibody responses in seropositive camels were enhancedby the vaccine; these camels had a higher average age than seronegative. Older seronegative camels responded more strongly to vaccination than younger animals; and neutralising antibodies were detected in nasal swabs. Further work is required to optimise vaccine regimens for younger seronegative camels.",

Although bats have been proposed as a possible natural reservoir of the virus 3 , dromedary camels are the only confirmed animal host so far. More than half (54.9%) of human primary cases have reported contact with camels 4 and the index patient in the Korean outbreak travelled back from the Gulf countries where MERS-CoV is endemic and circulating in dromedary camels 5 . Several studies of camels showed 74-100% seroprevalence rates of MERS-CoV in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula 6-10 . The mean Conversely, vaccinating seropositive camels with ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine (group + V) enhanced S1-specific Ab titre by one log compared to group +C over the three months post vaccination (Fig. 2B ,C and S1C), although both groups had similar baseline levels of Abs (0 d.p.i.). At the time of challenge, both groups had higher levels of S1-specific Abs compared to infectious camels. The fold increase in Ab endpoint titres in seropositive camels is shown in Fig. 2C .",

Furthermore, dromedary serum samples collected between 1983 and 2010 and archived in different countries in Africa and Arabia tested positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies (nAbs) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, a recent study in Saudi Arabia showed that 70% (n = 584) of dromedaries associated with confirmed human cases were seropositive with viral RNA being isolated from 12% of these dromedaries 5, 17 . Importantly, sequencing the viral RNA from both patients and their camels confirmed genetic similarity in every paired case 5, 17 . Therefore, it seems clear that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedaries in Africa and Arabia for the past three decades and has been causing human infections since 2012. Unlike the Arabian countries, there have been no reports of human cases in Africa, which could be due to under-diagnosis or differences in camel husbandry practices. One study has recently demonstrated that the virus in Africa may be genetically and phenotypically distinct 18 .",

In camels, the MERS-CoV infection is mild, transient and does not require veterinary care. There is therefore little encouragement for camel owners to vaccinate their animals against MERS-CoV. However, there is an increasing body of evidence on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic human cases amongst people who regularly have contact with camels, suggesting that these people may transmit the infection to the community 4, 19 . Therefore, successful vaccination of camels would reduce virus circulation in this animal host and thereby reduce human exposure, leading to a reduction in the number of human cases. In addition, developing a vaccine for humans and vaccinating humans at risk, such as camel keepers and health care workers, would further control the number of human infections and prevent the spread of the virus to the general population. The same vaccine may be developed for use in both camels and humans.",

It consists of a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing S1 subunit that binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on target cells, and a S2 subunit which contains the fusion peptide involved in viral fusion with target cells 20, 21 . Several vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in multiple animal models including mice, rabbits, non-human primates and dromedaries (reviewed in [22] [23] [24] . While many of these vaccines were designed based on full-length S protein, some others were targeting the S1 subunit or the RBD of the protein to focus the immune response on the critical neutralising epitopes to induce nAbs. Nonetheless, non-neutralising antibodies (Abs) could also aid in protection against MERS-CoV by inhibiting essential steps in viral replication such as virus-target cell fusion. Furthermore, it has been shown that nAbs alone could not confer sterilising immunity but could provide partial protection in camels probably due to several factors including waning of nAbs and genetic change of viral lineage [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Thus, developing a camel vaccine based on full-length S protein could potentially elicit more robust antibody and T cell response compared to shorter targets.",

We have for the first time utilised a natural infection model of challenge to evaluate MERS vaccine efficacy in camels in a 'real-world' setting rather than a single exposure to MERS-CoV in a challenge experiment conducted within biocontainment facilities.

Ten infectious camels (MERS-CoV naturally infected and viral shedding camels) confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV by RT-qPCR with a Ct value below 30 ( Figure S2 ) were co-housed with the experimental 20 calves from the vaccination experiment in one pen starting from 84 d.p.i. (Fig. 1 ), resulting in a total of 30 camels in a pen of 30 m2. As an arbitrary indication of infection, nasal discharges from camels in all groups were evaluated and scored from 0-3 (from normal to severe; as explained in the methods) depending on the discharge abundance for 14 d.p.c. Figure S3 . Areas under the curve (AUC) of these scores were plotted in Fig. 3 . Most camels in seropositive vaccinated (+V) and control (+C) groups had mild nasal discharges that resolved 5 and 7 days post challenge, respectively ( Figure S3B ,D); only three camels in both seropositive groups had severe nasal discharge that lasted for one or two days only. The seronegative groups (\u2212C and \u2212V) showed nasal discharge that persisted for two weeks. Overall, the vaccine in both seropositive and seronegative camels reduced the nasal discharge over time significantly as compared to control camels, p = 0.0274 as analysed by mixed model analysis. In the group \u2212V, the vaccine effect on reducing nasal discharges was not substantially different between prime-boost vaccinated camels (camel number: \u2212V-01 and \u2212V-05) and prime-only vaccinated camels ( Figure S3C ). The areas under the curve (AUC) of nasal discharge scores were also plotted to show the overall reduction in these scores in vaccinated camels as compared to the control camels, seropositive vaccinated camels had significant overall reduction in nasal discharge, p = 0.01 (Fig. 3B ).",

All of the 5 seronegative control (\u2212C) camels as well as some camels from other groups were infected very early and the number of virus shedding camels peaked to 23 camels by the second day post challenge, resulting in a very high viral exposure for uninfected camels. The number of infected camels remained >18 during the first week and started to decline by the second week post challenge ( Figure S4A ). Viral shedding was evaluated by testing for MERS-CoV RNA and evaluating viral titre in all post challenge nasal swabs using RT-qPCR ( Fig. 4 and S4 ). In all groups, viral RNA decreased to undetectable levels by 14 post challenge ( Figure S4G ). Seronegative vaccinated and control camels (\u2212V and \u2212C) shed high levels of the virus starting from day 2 to 9 post-challenge. On the contrary, seropositive camels (+C and +V) shed low levels of the virus post challenge (Fig. 4A ).

Serum samples were collected at day 0 pre-vaccination, and 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 d.p.i., and nasal swabs were also collected at 0, and 21 d.p.i. No detectable anti-S1 Abs were induced in the younger calves in AG02 group except for one camel with very low level of Abs, whereas Abs were detected in the older calves in group AG03 ( Fig. 5A and S5) . Similarly, circulatory and local nAb were only induced in older claves in group AG03 but not those in group AG02 (Fig. 5B-E) . Interestingly, the pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay (MERSpp NA) correlated significantly with the MERS-CoV neutralisation assay, R 2 = 0.96, p < 0.0001. (Fig. 5D) , both applied on same sera. Subsequent to vaccination and initial sampling, all calves in the age group study were kept for serological follow up in their pen, which is a separate pen, 200 m away from the pen of the main study, in which we performed the natural challenge. Unexpectedly, all calves in the age group study (including the control calves) demonstrated Whilst these calves were not tested for MERS-CoV RNA, this finding indicates that these calves were infected when the challenge study took place in the pen 200 m away. We strongly exclude the possibility of mechanical transfer of the virus due to the strict adherence of all staff to infection control measures, monitored by surveillance cameras, virus transmission and circulation to these calves through air could be possible.

Interestingly, older seronegative calves (1-2 years) responded to a single dose of the vaccine and elicited systemic and local nAbs. As the history of MERS-CoV exposure in these camels is not known, it is possible that older camels found here to be seronegative may have had some natural exposure to MERS-CoV but their Abs had then declined prior to their inclusion in the study as reported previously 25, 27 . Nonetheless, it is also possible that these seronegative calves were truly immune naive to MERS-CoV and that greater vaccine responsiveness occurs in older animals with a more mature immune system. It is very unlikely that maternal Abs play any part in the lack of vaccine responsiveness in younger calves because ChAdOx1 MERS is a viral vectored vaccine that does not express MERS S protein on the virion surface and so will not be affected by pre-existing Abs at the time of vaccination.",

Whereas virus shedding was minimal from seropositive vaccinated camels, further optimisation is required to enhance protection in seronegative camels including the number of doses and route of immunisation. Indeed, assessing the ability of an MVA-vectored MERS-CoV vaccine to protect camels against contained MERS-CoV challenge required administering multiple doses by both intramuscular and intranasal routes to significantly reduce virus shedding 36 . Therefore, protective effects of vaccine administered by either the intranasal or intramuscular route should be assessed. Of note, we show here that in older seronegative camels, nAbs in nasal secretions were induced after a single intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 MERS, but cannot rule out the possibility that these camels had previously been exposed to MERS-CoV despite proving seronegative on entry to the study, and the effects of intramuscular boosting after initial mucosal priming may be different from intramuscular priming of truly MERS-naive camels. The mechanism of vaccine-mediated or naturally acquired protection against MERS-CoV in camels is not yet known and further work will be required to study T cell responses as well as the possible contribution of immunity to antigens other than the S protein.",

Infectious camels were not removed from the pen after co-housing to mimic natural conditions. Even under these stringent conditions one camel in group +V demonstrated complete absence of virus shedding, with two others (out of a total of 5) in the same group shedding extremely low levels of virus, indicating that high levels of protective immunity can be achieved. Importantly, this group had high level of nAbs that plateaued for a year, unlike the +C group that had decreasing nAb titres overtime. These results suggest that vaccinating seropositive camels with S-based vaccine could boost their pre-existing MERS-specific immunity and minimise viral shedding. Nonetheless, following single dose vaccination, virus shedding was reduced in both seropositive and seronegative camels, which would reduce the likelihood of transmission to other camels or humans. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Previous work as well as ours have shown excellent correlation between pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays 37 . Thus, it is expected that most nAbs detected by MERSpp neutralization assay bind to RBD or close to the binding site in a manner that blocks binding to the DPP4 cellular receptor, although the binding sites of nAbs detected in the pseudotyped virus neutralization assay have not been determined per se. Nonetheless, non-neutralising S-specific Abs could also interfere with MERS-CoV entry and fusion in a similar manner to stem-specific anti-influenza hemagglutinin Abs 38 , but this has not yet been assessed for MERS-CoV. Similarly, S1-based ELISA have shown excellent correlation with live virus neutralization assay although both nAbs as well as non-neutralising binding Abs could be detected by ELISA 39, 40 . In the current study, we found that induction of S1-binding non-neutralising Abs alone is insufficient to reduce viral shedding and only the presence of nAbs can minimise virus excretion. Nonetheless, previous studies suggest that only presence of high levels on nAb titres may provide sterilising immunity in dromedaries as even seropositive camels could be re-infected as nAbs wane over time [25] [26] [27] [28] . Our study also clearly confirms that MERS-CoV re-infection occur in dromedaries.",

Additional ten seropositive and MERS-CoV RT-PCR negative camel calves were purchased from a camel market in Riyadh. Ten seronegative and seropositive calves were used in the main study whereas the remaining nine seronegative calves were used in a small follow up study to determine the age effect. Additional ten actively MERS-CoV shedding/infected camels (positive by RT-PCR; Ct value below 30) were purchased from local markets and co-housed with the experimental calves in one pen to serve as a natural infection model of challenge.

The viral RNA was serially diluted at 1:10 dilution factor then each dilution was used to synthesise cDNA. Camel nasal swabs in VTM were also used to extract total RNA and to synthesis cDNA. cDNA samples were used with ORF1a primers and probe (previously described 48 ), to set a standard curve using TaqMan master mix and ABi 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The cutoff of this assay was determined based on the last dilution before the plateau of the standard curve of the cultured viral RNA. Negative nasal swab samples from healthy humans and healthy camels were used to confirm this cutoff as shown in Figure S2B . Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed to analyse the change in virus titres as well as nasal discharge scores over time post infection challenge. First, a mixed model for repeated measures design of the log-transformed MERS-CoV GE (TCID 50 /ml) values was employed to account for the covariance among repeated measures and assess the change in virus titres over time. Virus titres in all animals (subjects) were measured daily (equally spaced time points), the within-subject association among the repeated measures is modelled by assuming a first-order autoregressive correlation structure matrix. The same analysis model was also applied on the nasal discharge scores collected over time (from 1 to 14 days post challenge). Next, areas under the curve (AUC) of log-transformed MERS-CoV GE (TCID 50 /ml) values and nasal discharge scores collected from 1 to 14 d.p.c. for the two experimental groups (vaccinated and control) across the two conditions of seropositivity status (seropositive and seronegative) was reported. This analysis was conducted to display whether there are differences in virus titres nasal discharge scores between groups; it also includes Cohen's f 2 test, which is a standardised measure of effect size, ensuring the suitability of our study sample size for the statistical testing that we performed, see Supplementary statistic file.
