            "text": "Background: Simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support singlepeak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. Methods: We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. Results: The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. Conclusions: Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.",

Epidemic incidence data is a valuable epidemiological tool to assess, and forecast, trends and transmission potential in real time [7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the aggregated case data rarely contain the information, such as transmission pathways and other population characteristics, needed to create a realistic model for disease transmission [8] . For example, during the first few months of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, weekly national-level epidemic curves for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were made publicly available by the World Health Organization (WHO) [11] . In contrast, Ebola virus first affected the village of Gueckedou in Guinea, and the transmission chains rapidly crossed the nearby porous borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia [11] . Therefore, epidemic curves at finer spatial and temporal resolutions covering the relevant interacting communities would have been more pertinent to assess the spreading pattern and guide control efforts.",

These models often use a metapopulation framework to incorporate population heterogeneity by dividing the population into socio-demographic groups based on the Fig. 1 The number of sub-epidemics for epidemic waves associated with different parameters. The number of sub-epidemics comprising an epidemic wave depends on the parameters K 0 , q, and C thr as explained in the main text susceptibility, infectivity, mobility patterns, or other individual characteristics related to the transmission dynamics [15] [16] [17] [18] . The individuals in the same group are assumed to be homogenous, and the heterogeneity of the population is limited by the number of groups. Even when the number of parameters that can be estimated from limited data is small, the model must include enough complexity to account for the underlying transmission dynamics. Past studies indicate that simple logistic-type growth models tend to underestimate the peak timing and duration of epidemic outbreaks [19] [20] [21] . Also, these simple logistic-type phenomenological growth models typically can support only a single-wave epidemic trajectory characterized by a single peak in the number of new infections followed by a \"burnout\" period, unless there are external driving forces, such as a seasonal variation in contact patterns.",

Hence, the coarse-scale-observed epidemic is created from the aggregation of overlapping sub-epidemics in the groups that follow a regular structure. These sub-epidemics are usually unobserved and shaped by population heterogeneity. The groups are determined by the susceptibility of the underlying populations (e.g., spatially clustered pockets of susceptible individuals), population mobility patterns, the natural history of the disease, infections moving across different risk groups, varying public health interventions, and rapidly changing environmental factors, to name a few. This approach allows the model forecast to depend upon changes in the composition of individual groups based on temporal changes of healthcare, or local behavior changes that impact the case incidence for a given spatial area or subpopulations such as schools or socio-demographic groups.",

This may be attributed to the model structure (structural identifiability) or due to the lack of information in a given dataset, which could be associated with the number of observations and the spatial-temporal resolution of the data [23, 24] . Because the time series of incident cases in the observed epidemic wave is an aggregation of the overlapping sub-epidemics, different sub-epidemic profiles may give rise to indistinguishable aggregated epidemic waves. This can happen if the parameters are correlated and different combinations of parameters result in the same fit of the data but have different forecasts. For a given epidemic wave, the number of subepidemics could be correlated with the size of individual sub-epidemics and parameter C thr which sets the timing of the subsequent sub-epidemic. For example, given a fixed sub-epidemic size, as C thr increases, a smaller number of sub-epidemics can be fit to the epidemic wave. When a parameter is associated with substantial uncertainty, researchers may decide to constrain its range to lie within a plausible or realistic range and as close as Fig. 5 Best fit of the sub-epidemic wave model to the plague epidemic in Madagascar. This model yielded the best fit to the weekly incidence curve. Moreover, our results predict an epidemic wave comprised by 5 sub-epidemics of decreasing size. Further, parameter estimates are well identified as indicated by their relatively narrow confidence intervals. For instance, the 95% confidence interval for the size of the initial subepidemic ranges between 634 and 761.

Cyan curves are the associated uncertainty from individual bootstrapped curves assuming a Poisson error structure. Different sub-epidemics comprising the epidemic wave are plotted using different colors possible to a best guess based on demographic and epidemiological data. For instance, the size of the first subepidemic should not be too small (e.g., K 0 > 100). Moreover, by design the number of sub-epidemics comprising an epidemic wave in our model is constrained by C thr < K 0 . Further, the cumulative case threshold C thr could be further constrained so that it does not exceed the cumulative number of cases at peak incidence.",

During the first 28 weeks of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC (06 Sep 2018 to 11 Mar 2019), our sub-epidemic model outperformed the simpler models (Table 1 and Fig. 6 ). For instance, the sub-epidemic model yielded a Fig. 9 Sub-epidemic profiles of the epidemic wave forecasts for the plague epidemic in Madagascar displayed in Fig. 8 . The epidemic wave model predicts a \"traveling wave\" composed of asynchronous sub-epidemics when the model is fitted to the weekly incidence just before or around the epidemic peak. Once the declining phase of the epidemic is apparent, the model predicts a slowly declining tail of the epidemic wave with some relatively mild oscillations. Black circles correspond to the data points. Different colors represent different sub-epidemics of the epidemic wave profile. The vertical line indicates the start time of the forecast much lower MIS and much higher coverage of the 95% prediction interval compared to simpler growth models (Table 1) . Moreover, our results predict an epidemic wave consisting of 4 sub-epidemics of stable size (~250 cases) as the parameter q is estimated to be very low, suggesting a stable incidence pattern (Fig. 6) . Further, parameter estimates are well identified as indicated by their relatively narrow confidence intervals. For instance, the 95% confidence interval for the initial sub-epidemic size ranges from 232 to 275. However, some of the most recent incidence data points lie substantially above the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval.

Moreover, when calibrated with the trajectory of the initial growth phase, traditional models (e.g., logistic growth type models) tend to predict a near immediate decline in the epidemic trajectory [19] while our epidemic wave model forecasts traveling waves of variable shapes including resurgent epidemics stemming from the aggregation of asynchronous sub-epidemics [45] .

For instance, in real-time epidemic forecasting applications, it could be possible to relax the assumptions regarding the regularity in the timing and evolution of sub-epidemic sizes in our model by relying on additional data stemming from field investigations. For instance, additional data could inform the timing and relative size of unfolding sub-epidemics. Furthermore, future work could investigate the forecasting performance of the sub-epidemic model with that of mechanistic models developed for specific diseases and contexts. Among mechanistic models, one could consider metapopulation transmission models that integrate sub-epidemics shaped by dynamic transmission rates or effective population sizes that fluctuate due to interventions or behavior changes.",
