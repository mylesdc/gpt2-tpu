A potential approach to treat multiple pathogen infections and that should not induce drug resistance is the use of small molecules that target host components. We identified the compound 1-adamantyl (5-bromo-2-methoxybenzyl) amine (ABMA) from a cell-based high throughput screening for its capacity to protect human cells and mice against ricin toxin without toxicity. This compound efficiently protects cells against various toxins and pathogens including viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasite. ABMA provokes Rab7-positive late endosomal compartment accumulation in mammalian cells without affecting other organelles (early endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus). As the mechanism of action of ABMA is restricted to host-endosomal compartments, it reduces cell infection by pathogens that depend on this pathway to invade cells. ABMA may represent a novel class of broadspectrum compounds with therapeutic potential against diverse severe infectious diseases.",

Four hits were confirmed; two hits named Retro-1 and Retro-2 were reported as inhibitors of ricin and Shiga-like toxins (Stx) by blocking their retrograde transport inside host cells 14 .

The curves for treated animals are statistically different from control as measured by the log rank test (p < 0.01 for 2 mg/kg of ABMA; p < 0.001 for 20 mg/kg,; p < 0.001 for 200 mg/kg).",

ABMA was non-toxic to animals after one intra-peritoneal (ip) administration up to 200 mg/kg. A model of ricin intoxication by nasal instillation 14 was used to mimic exposure by aerosols, as would occur during an intentional release. Briefly, mice were challenged by an LD 90 of ricin (2 \u03bcg/kg) at day 0 (Fig. 1C , closed circles). The first clinical signs of intoxication appeared within 24 h, all mice displaying bristly and greasy hairs. From day 2, weight loss was observed. At later time points other signs were noticed such as prostration, shaking and respiratory distress, with animals needing to be euthanized starting from day 7 post exposure. A statistically significant protection according to survival curves was observed with a single ip dose of 2 mg/kg of ABMA 1 h prior toxin challenge (p < 0.01 versus control, Fig. 1C , open circles). Forty eight % (n = 25; 3 independent experiments) of ABMA-treated mice survived, while in the control group, survival was 11.5% (n = 130, from 10 independent experiments). Based on this result, additional experiments were performed with escalating doses of ABMA. Administration of a single ip dose of 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of ABMA prior to ricin intoxication gave improved, statistically significant, levels of protection as compared to the control group (p < 0.001, n = 5 for both groups). The 20 mg/kg dose fully protected animals through to day 21 (Fig. 1C) . The 200 mg/kg dose resulted in 80% of protection of mice against ricin challenge with a single animal succumbing on day 15. The lower protection seen with the higher dose may be due to solubility issues of ABMA in aqueous solution resulting in uncertain biodistribution at the highest dose.",

We also found that ABMA protected other cell lines (e.g. Vero, PC3, A431 and DLD1) as well as HUVEC primary cells against DT (data not shown). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of ABMA on DT is not cell type-specific. Anthrax LT cleaves the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK2 19 . Figure 2B shows that MEK2 cleavage by LT in HUVECs was partially inhibited in the presence of ABMA at 30 \u00b5M. TcdB and TcsL inactivate small GTPases by their glucosyltransferase activity. This disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and induces cell rounding 20 . ABMA reduced Vero cells rounding 4 and 8 folds, respectively, following a challenge by TcdB for 4 h and by TcsL for 18 h (Fig. 2C,D) . The EC 50 s were 73.3 \u00b1 9.1 \u00b5M for TcdB and 86.7 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b5M for TcsL (n = 3).",

Thus, it is very unlikely that ABMA inhibits the toxins' catalytic activities. Each of those toxins uses a different cell-surface component as a receptor for cell binding and internalization (see Table S1 ). Thus, ABMA probably doesn't inhibit the binding of the toxins to their receptors. Nevertheless, we investigated whether ABMA could inhibit the binding of DT receptor binding domain, named DTR8 22 , to its receptor pro-HB-EGF (Precursor of heparin binding epidermal growth factor analog) as a model for toxin-receptor interaction 23 . A SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 7: 15567 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-15466-7 fluorescent DTR8 was made by chemical coupling with Alexa488 (DTR A488 ). FACS analysis showed that ABMA did not affect binding of Alexa488 labeled-DTR8 (DTR A488 ) with its receptor on Vero cells (Fig. S4) , suggests that the inhibition of DT cytotoxicity induced by ABMA is not due to a reduced binding of DT to its receptor.",

They require low-pH endosomes (early endosomes (EE) and LE) where they undergo a conformational change, leading to the interaction of their transmembrane and catalytic domains with the compartments' membrane and translocation of their catalytic domain into the cytosol 8 . In contrast, ABMA had barely any protective effect on the intoxication of HeLa cells by Stx2.

They use host-cell materials to form a distinct, degradation-resistant but replication-permissive membranous compartment, the vacuole or inclusion. Despite differences, their intracellular life-styles share several common features. Proteomic characterization of the Simkania negevensis (Sn) containing vacuole (SnCV) has shown that it contains proteins from several main host transport pathways including the endosomal pathway 13 . Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) recruits multiple Rab proteins from the endosomes to the inclusion membrane and avoids travelling to the phago-lysosome as a final destination 27 . Besides the Golgi apparatus, multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), also known as LE, are another essential source of cholesterol and sphingomyelin for the development of Ctr inclusions 28, 29 . Thus, we tested whether ABMA could inhibit the infection of cells by Sn and Ctr. Figure 4A shows that 75 \u00b5M of ABMA sharply reduced the amount of Sn in infected cells as revealed by immunoblotting of Sn heat-shock protein 60 (snHSP60). In parallel, inclusion sizes were smaller as revealed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4B) . The Sn progeny harvested from ABMA-treated cells reduced the amount of Sn (Fig. 4C ) and the number of inclusions upon infection of fresh, untreated cells (Fig. 4D,E) . ABMA at 75 \u00b5M slightly reduced the cellular load of GFP-expressing Ctr strain in the primary infection as seen by Ctr HSP60 (ctrHSP60) immunoblotting (Fig. 5A) . However, ABMA treatment dramatically reduced chlamydial progeny infectivity indicated by the reduced inclusion number and bacterial load (Fig. 5A,B) . Together, our results show that ABMA inhibits the capacity of Sn and Ctr to develop properly during cell infection and leads to a progeny with reduced infectivity.",

            "text": "Monocytes and macrophages are important target cells in the pathophysiology of Leishmania parasite infections 30 . The parasite is internalized and develops into an amastigote form within a parasitophorous vacuole that incorporates endo-lysosomal pathway components 30, 31 . Thus, we investigated whether ABMA could inhibit the infection of RAW 264.7 macrophages by Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Amphotericin B and miltefosine, which are approved drugs for the clinical management of Leishmaniasis, were used as reference drugs. Table 1 shows that all three drugs inhibited L. infantum intramacrophage amastigotes development with various EC 50s . The EC 50 for ABMA was around 7 \u00b5M. Interestingly, the two reference drugs were capable of inhibiting axenic amastigotes with an efficacy similar to that found on intramacrophage amastigotes, whereas ABMA had no direct effect on the axenic parasite, up to 100 \u00b5M. In addition, the ABMA cytoxicity was lower than those of the reference drugs. These results strongly suggest that ABMA blocks L. infantum intracellular development by an action on host cell while the other drugs are directly toxic to the parasite. ABMA induces accumulation of late endocytic compartments. We have determined that ABMA can inhibit the intoxication or infection of cells by a variety of toxins, viruses and intracellular microorganisms. The toxins and the viruses rely on endosome acidification to enter the cytosol. The bacteria and parasite build a vacuole that incorporates endosome membranes and proteins to acquire their nutrients and proliferate. This may suggest that ABMA targets and modifies acidic endosomes and their homeostasis. We observed by confocal microscopy that live A549 cells treated with ABMA and stained by LysoTracker \u00ae Deep Red exhibited more intensely labeled and enlarged fluorescent puncta than cells treated with DMSO only (Fig. 6A , middle and left panels respectively). In contrast, bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), a highly specific v-ATPase inhibitor that prevents endosome acidification, decreased fluorescence staining of cells (Fig. 6A, right panel) . We obtained similar results with ABMA and Baf A1 on HeLa and RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). To confirm that ABMA is affecting acidic endosomes, we used acridine orange, another cell-permeant dye for acidic organelles (Fig. 6A , central and lower panels). Similarly, ABMA induced larger and brighter red fluorescent vesicles in A549 cells, in contrast to the effect of Baf A1, which strongly decreased red fluorescence in cytoplasmic vesicles. Altogether, ABMA had an effect on acidic compartments different from that of Baf A1. Baf A1 is known to inhibit DT toxicity by inhibiting endosome acidification. It might be expected that combined effect of both molecules might annihilate the impact of each other: increased endosome acidification for ABMA versus decreased acidification for BafA1. Surprisingly, ABMA combined with Baf A1 had an inhibitory effect on DT cytotoxicity twenty fold higher than for each molecule alone (Fig. S6) . This strongly suggests that ABMA and Baf A1 have different mechanisms of action and distinct targets. Moreover, this indicates that the anti-toxin and anti-pathogenic effect of ABMA is not linked to the increase in endosome acidification; otherwise it would be counter balanced by Baf A1.",

Filipin III, a fluorescent probe with high affinity for cholesterol was applied to cells treated respectively with DMSO, ABMA and U18666A, an intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor.

Finally, the ricin in vivo assay demonstrates that an inhibitor with a limited efficacy in vitro (5 to 10-fold reduction of ricin toxicity) can be enough to protect mice against a lethal toxin challenge. These findings suggest that ABMA may impair Ebola infection in mice, considering its lowest EC 50 on Ebola among all tested pathogens and toxins in vitro. Several broad-spectrum anti-pathogen compounds have recently been identified from cell-based HTS. They all have direct actions on host cells instead of on the pathogen itself, at \u00b5M level 1-5 . Amodiaquine, a clinically approved drug to treat malaria, protects cells against multiple toxins (anthrax lethal toxin, DT, TcdB) and viruses (Ebola, SARS coronavirus, Rabies, Chikungunya) by inhibiting host cathepsin B 3 . Bithionol, an anthelmintic approved drug, inhibits host caspases and also reduces the toxicity of anthrax lethal toxin, DT, cholera toxin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, botulinum neurotoxin, ricin, and Zika virus 4 . EGA, an active molecule against anthrax lethal toxin also blocks in vitro trafficking of various toxins (DT, exotoxin A, cytolethal distending toxin, Botulinum Neurotoxins, Clostridium toxins) and viruses (influenza virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) to acidified endosomes 2,15,17 . Retro-2 was proved to have a broad-spectrum action on toxins (ricin, Stx, cholera toxin), viruses (Ebola, Marburg, vaccinia virus, enterovirus 71, adeno-associated virus, polyoma and papillomaviruses), intracellular bacteria (Sn, Ctr), and parasite (Leishmania) by interfering with the intracellular trafficking machinery at the EE-trans Golgi interface 1, 34, 35 . It is worth noting that ABMA and Retro-2 have demonstrated efficacy in vivo. Even if the list of pathogens tested do not overlap in these publications preventing insightful comparisons, distinct mode of action of inhibitors on host cells, and particularly on trafficking pathway, may explain the variety of anti-pathogen spectra observed. Thus, in some instances combinations of these inhibitors may increase, additionally or synergistically, the protection efficacy.",

            "text": "LE have long been considered as important sorting stations in the endocytic pathway 41 ; they determine whether particular proteins or lipids are targeted to lysosomes for degradation, or alternatively, recycled to the ER or the Golgi apparatus 42 . In addition, MVBs/LE may fuse with the plasma membrane to release exosomes 43 . The endosomal pathway is essential for several toxins and viruses to translocate into the cytosol 41 . Importantly, LE could also supply nutrition (i.e. cholesterol, membrane proteins) for the development of bacteria and parasites inside host cells 30, 44, 45 . Moreover, similarly to what we observe on human cells with ABMA (Figs 6 and 7) , knock-down of Rab7 in HeLa cells results in enlarged MVBs/LE with increased ILVs, which consequently blocks EGFR exiting from MVBs/LE 46 . Thus, the pharmacologic interference of ABMA with the cellular function of Rab7, a key regulator of late endocytic trafficking, might explain its broad-spectrum anti-pathogen activity. Designing drugs that target LE may constitute an advantageous strategy to obtain broad-spectrum drugs against many intracellular pathogens.",
