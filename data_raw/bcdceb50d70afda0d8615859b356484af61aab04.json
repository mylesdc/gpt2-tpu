It has caused heavy losses in global agriculture in recent decades. Rapid detection of PCV2 is very important for the effective prophylaxis and treatment of PMWS. Results: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was used to detect PCV2 in this study. Three pairs of primers were specially designed for recognizing eight distinct sequences of the ORF2 gene. This gene lies in the PCV2 virus genome sequence, and encodes the Rep protein that is involved in virus replication. Time and temperature conditions for amplification of PCV2 genes were optimized to be 55 min at 59\u00b0C. The analysis of clinical samples indicated that the LAMP method was highly sensitive. The detection limit for PCV2 by the LAMP assay was 10 copies, whereas the limit by conventional PCR was 1000 copies. The assay did not cross-react with PCV1, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs virus or rotavirus. When 110 samples were tested using the established LAMP system, 95 were detected as positive.",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Circoviridiae family [1] . This virus is widespread in the commercial swine population, and is accepted as the causative agent of a number of diseases in these animals, such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [2] , and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). These syndromes cause great losses to the pig industry. As a result, it is necessary to develop an effective method for detecting PCV2 to prevent these diseases. At present, many methods have been developed for the detection of this virus; among which, conventional PCR is commonly used [3] . However, the usefulness of PCR is limited by the presence of PCR inhibitors in the analysis of real biological samples. The wide range of inhibitors (including organic and inorganic substances such as detergents, antibiotics, phenolic compounds, enzymes, polysaccharides, fats, proteins and salts) reduces the amplification efficiency [4, 5] . Apart from PCR, ELISA is one of the more common methods for virus detection [6] . It is hard to make a definitive diagnosis with ELISA in infected swine, because falsepositive results may be included in the analysis [7] . In addition, real-time PCR is a good method to perform quantitative and qualitative analysis of PCV2 [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, this method demands high-quality technical personnel. Hence, a rapid, sensitive and easy-to-operate method is still needed, especially for examination of PCV2.",

The method is easily performed and highly specific for the target sequence because six independent sequences recognize the target sequence in the initial stage and four independent sequences amplify the target sequence in the later stage of the reaction [13, 14] . LAMP assay has advantages in specificity, selectivity and rapidity over other nucleic acid amplification methods [13] . LAMP has been further advanced by using forward loop primers [15] . The method has been a valuable tool for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases in hospital laboratories and for the rapid detection of pathogenic microbes in food [16] . The use of LAMP for detecting PCV2 has been reported by Chen et al [17] . In their study, only four primers were used and no betaine was added to the LAMP assay. However, in our study, six primers containing two loop primers were used to amplify different regions of PCV2. It complemented and extended previous methods for PCV2 detection and provided an alternative approach for detection of PCV2. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop a LAMP assay for detecting ORF2 gene in PCV2 (which encodes Rep protein that is involved in virus replication), and to establish a more specific, sensitive, rapid and simple detection method for PCV2.",

We suggest that the set of primers had high specificity for the ORF2 gene of PCV2, according to PCR and other nucleic acid sequence-based methods. The LAMP method had high specificity for the target gene because six independent sequences (F1c, F2, F3, B1c, B2 and B3) recognized the target sequence in the initial stage, and four independent sequences (F1c, F2, B1c and B2) have been shown previously to amplify the target sequence in the later stage of the LAMP reaction [14] . However, the PCR assay only had one pair of primers to amplify the target gene. The big difference between the previous study and our research is that two loop primers take part in the LAMP reaction. The ORF2 gene of PCV2 has high specificity for detection of this virus.",
