These pathogens has evolved to acquire a wide variety of virulence genes, among which those encode for a type III secretion system (T3SS) and the related proteins are shown to play central roles in the colonization and A/E pathogenesis of the bacteria 3 . T3SS is widely distributed among Gram-negative pathogens and functions to translocate diverse bacterial effector proteins into host cells 4 . In EPEC and EHEC, a battery of up to 40 effector proteins are delivered via T3SS, leading to not only enterocyte damages but also subversions of multiple cellular signaling pathways 3 . It was recently shown that T3SS also participates in host cell sensing and post-attachment remodeling of gene expressions. The process was demonstrated to be mediated by the T3SS-specific chaperone CesT antagonizing the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA 5 .",

In addition to effector binding, CesT is also shown to play a role in effector secretion, mediating hierarchical protein translocations 10 . It is notable that Infection studies in both cell line and animal models have demonstrated that CesT is essential for efficient host colonization 6, 7 .

It is notable that it has been proposed that CesT, in the absence of a domain-swap event, might also form an unswapped dimer similar to other T3SS chaperones 11 .

A central player in this system is the CsrA/ RsmA protein which is able to bind the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thereby repress translation initiation 22, 23 . The activity of CsrA is further modulated by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs, e.g., CsrB/C and RsmX/ Y/Z 24, 25 ) , which can competitively antagonize the binding of CsrA to mRNA and relive the translation repression 26, 27 .",

These results remind us of the possibility that two identical ligand binding sites could be present in both CesT and CsrA dimers. We therefore first investigate the binding features between the two proteins via analytical gel filtration chromatography. CsrA was initially expressed as a GST-fusion protein and then enzymatically digested to remove the fusion-tags (Fig. 1a) ; while CesT was expressed as a 6xHis-tagged protein. Both proteins were individually prepared to homogeneity and then mixed for in vitro binding analyses. As expected, stable CesT/CsrA complex forms in solution. The resultant complex species is mainly eluted in the void peak with an estimated molecular weight of more than 440 kDa and exhibits high heterogeneity (Fig. 1b) . Noted that CesT and CsrA dimers are of~35.4 kDa and~13.7 kDa respectively, the result is therefore consistent with our expectations that both CesT and CsrA dimers contain two ligand binding sites, leading to irregular protein aggregations upon complex formation. We further determined the real time binding kinetics between CesT and CsrA via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The observed profile revealed typical slow-on/slow-off binding characteristics, and fits well with the Bivalent-Analyte model which describes the binding of a bivalent protein (in the current case the CsrA dimer) to an immobilized ligand (in the current case CesT) (Fig. 1c) . The affinity (K D ) of the first ligand binding site in CsrA to CesT was calculated to be~148 nM.",

It is notable that CsrA and its homologous proteins in other bacteria contain an extended C-terminal \u03b1-helix which has been shown in previous reports to play pivotal roles in ligand binding 23, 26 . We therefore hypothesized that this terminal helical component, which extends from E45 to Y61 (Fig. 1a) , is also involved in engaging CesT. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a GST-pulldown experiment with either the wildtype (WT) CsrA or a CsrA-variant (CsrA-C del , residues M1-R44) which lacks the C-terminal helix. While the WT protein efficiently pulldowns CesT, CsrA-C del completely lost its CesT binding avidity (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The result enabled us to make a new CsrA construct that reserves only a single CesT binding site by linking CsrA-C del with full-length CsrA via a tenresidue linker (GGGGSGGGGS) (Fig. 1a) . As expected, the resultant recombinant protein (denoted Re-CsrA hereafter) remains competent in CesT engagement and forms stable complex with CesT in solution as with WT CsrA (Fig. 1b) . In contrast to the WT protein-complex, however, the CesT/Re-CsrA complex behaves as homogeneous protein species with an estimated molecular weight of~60 kDa, coinciding well with two Re-CsrA (~12.5 kDa) molecules binding to one CesT dimer. The interactions between Re-CsrA and CesT were further analyzed via SPR. In contrast to WT CsrA, the recombinant protein binds CesT with a fast-on/fast-off mode (Fig. 1c) . Despite of the altered binding kinetics (which is commonly observed in the ligand/receptor interactions when the interface residues are mutated [34] [35] [36] , the affinity between Re-CsrA and CesT, which is calculated to be~151 nM, is in good accordance with that observed for the WT proteins. The recombinant protein therefore represents a good candidate for structural investigations on the molecular basis of CesT/CsrA recognition.",

Inspired by the high homogeneity of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex, we used this protein species for crystal screening and managed to collect a dataset of 2.3-\u00c5 resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to R work = 0.233 and R free = 0.251, respectively ( Table 1 ). The final model contains, in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, two CesT/Re-CsrA complexes which are essentially of the same structure. Superimposition of the two complexes reveals a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.713 \u00c5 for all the equivalent C\u03b1 atoms. As expected, each complex is composed of two Re-CsrA molecules and one CesT dimer (Fig. 2) . For Re-CsrA, clear electron densities could be traced for residues M1-P37 of the CsrA-C del moiety and residues M1-K55 of the following full-length CsrA entity. These amino acids assemble into a compact \u03b2-barrel core with one terminal helix extending out into the bulk solvent. Overall, the Re-CsrA structure is quite similar to that of the swapped dimer of native CsrA. Superimposition of the two structures revealed both wellaligned core-barrel strands and the terminal helix. The secondary structure components of Re-CsrA (strands \u03b21\u2032-\u03b24\u2032 in CsrA-C del , \u03b21-\u03b25 and \u03b11 in full-length CsrA) were therefore labeled such that CsrA-C del was viewed as an equivalent to the second protomer of the native dimer, highlighted with the prime symbols. Without helix \u03b11\u2032, Re-CsrA also lacks traceable electron densities for the \u03b25\u2032 strand due to flexibility, which could be otherwise clearly observed in the native CsrA dimer structure (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). It is also noteworthy that Re-CsrA uses its peripheral side-patch, created by strands \u03b21\u2032, \u03b24, \u03b25, and helix \u03b11, for CesT binding (Fig. 2) . The structure therefore in turn verifies our analytical gel filtration results, demonstrating that the recombinant CsrA protein indeed retains a single but integral CesT binding site.",

A previous study on CesT reveals that the molecule, unlike the other bacterial T3SS chaperones as exemplified by the SigE molecule of Salmonella enterica, exhibited a unique domain-swapped dimeric architecture 11 . In this dimer structure (denoted dimer form A hereafter), the N-terminal \u03b11 helix, \u03b21 strand, and their intervening loop form a discrete module, intertwining with the other protomer such that its \u03b21 strand pairs with strand \u03b22 from the other CesT molecule. In addition, the C-terminal residues K140-E143 fold into an extra strand (\u03b26), aligning in an antiparallel manner with \u03b21 on the other side (Fig. 3a ). In such a dimer, the long \u03b13 helices from the two protomers further symmetrically pack against each other. This domain-arrangement mode therefore created a CesT dimer with a two-fold rotation symmetry around an axis that locates in between the two swapped \u03b2-sheets and vertically passes through the packed \u03b13 helices (Fig. 3a) . It is also notable that due to strand-swapping, the dimer is predominantly stabilized by the main-chain hydrogen bond contacts among adjacent \u03b2-strands with hydrophobic interactions of less profoundness contributed by the apolar residue side-chains.",

Without the swapped \u03b21 strand, the C-terminal residues K140-E143 form a loop in our structure, which were otherwise of rigid strand conformation (\u03b26) in the form A dimer described above. Overall, the CesT molecules assemble into a dimer around the \u03b12-\u03b24 motif such that the \u03b12 helices in the two protomers are aligned with each other in an almost parallel manner.

            "text": "On the whole, the architecture of the form B CesT dimer is quite similar to that observed in the unswapped salmonella SigE molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3b) . In both dimers, the two protomers assemble around the \u03b12 helix and \u03b24 strand, forming a core dimeric interface in which multiple apolar and aromatic residues created a strong hydrophobic center. The CesT dimer, however, was further clenched at peripheral by the extended Cterminal motif. A most important stabilizing contact was contributed by the \u03b14 helix, which protrudes into the otherwise exposed groove formed by helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 in the other protomer and presents several residues (especially Y153) for mainly apolar inter-molecule interactions ( Supplementary  Fig. 3c ). It is unexpected that the C-terminal part of CesT forms a helical structure and extends exclusively into the other protomer of the dimer. It is notable that other T3SS chaperones, such as SycT from Yersinia enterocolitica, also contains an extended C-terminal loop which interacts with the \u03b22-\u03b23 interloop from the other molecule of the dimer 37, 38 . Nevertheless, CesT extends its C-terminal helix into the other molecule to a much greater extent, providing much stronger and more intimate inter-molecule interactions than those observed for SycT ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). Such dimeric arrangement with a swapped C-terminal domain seems unique which has not been observed in the other T3SS chaperone structures reported previously [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . It is also noteworthy that the \u03b12-\u03b13 helices of one CesT molecule also in turn stabilized the swapped Structural basis of the binding between CesT and CsrA. The atomic binding details between CesT and CsrA were then systematically investigated based on the complex structure solved in this study. Overall, Re-CsrA utilizes its intact CsrA-dimer part composed of helix \u03b11, strands \u03b21\u2032, \u03b24, \u03b25, and their intervening loops for CesT engagement, contacting mainly the \u03b21-\u03b22 interloop, the long \u03b13 helix, and the swapped terminal helix \u03b14 (from the other protomer) in the chaperone dimer (Fig. 4a ). In total, these components buried a surface area of 836.2 \u00c5 2 in Re-CsrA and 893.9 \u00c5 2 in the CesT dimer, respectively. Along this extended interface, the inter-molecule amino acid interactions can further be allocated to three binding patches (Patch1, 2, and 3) as to the protomer affiliations (to either the parental molecule of the dimer or the second protomer) of the engaging components. The first patch involves Re-CsrA strand \u03b21\u2032 and CesT helix \u03b13, representing interactions contributed by the second CsrA protomer with the parental CesT molecule (Fig. 4a) . The former presents three residues I3, L4, and T5 to pack against CesT E121, providing both hydrogen bond and apolar carbon-carbon interactions (Fig. 4b) . In contrast to Patch1, Patch2 is much more extended and consists of multiple components from the CsrA and CesT parental molecules (Fig. 4a) . A series of charged and hydrophilic residues were observed to locate in this second patch, forming a strong polar (hydrogen bond and/or salt bridge) contact network. These include the Re-CsrA residues R31 located in strand \u03b24, K38 in the \u03b24-\u03b25 inter-loop, and V42 (with its mainchain groups) and R44 in strand \u03b25 interacting with the CesT amino acids D34 in the \u03b21-\u03b22 intervening loop, Y37 in the \u03b22 strand, and E121, N122, N129, T133 in the \u03b13 helix and its following loop (Fig. 4c) . For Patch3, it is mainly the parental CsrA contacting the second CesT protomer, involving strand \u03b25 and helix \u03b11 in Re-CsrA and the swapped \u03b14 helix in CesT (Fig. 4a) .",

In addition, Y152 of CesT also forms two hydrogen bonds with CsrA H43 and R44, respectively (Fig. 4d) . The defined amino acid interactions therefore revealed a CesT/CsrA binding mode which is mediated mainly by the polar interactions among hydrophilic interface residues.

The proteins were then tested for their ligand binding avidities via ELISA. For CesT, deletion of the C-terminal \u03b14 helix (CesT-C del ) and individual or simultaneous substitution of the key interface residues E121 and Y152 with alanine all dramatically jeopardized its ability to engage CsrA. While WT CesT potently binds to both native CsrA and Re-CsrA, the CesT mutants only show a very weak binding at the highest concentration tested (500 \u00b5g/ml) (Fig. 4e, f) . Reciprocally, the four basic interface-residues (R31, K38, H43, and R44) in CsrA were mutated (to alanine) and the resultant mutant protein was tested for its interaction with WT CesT.

            "text": "Mechanism of CsrA modulation by CesT. It is notable that CsrA, as a global post-transcriptional regulator, exerts its regulatory function by binding specifically to the mRNA RBS sequence, thereby leading to translational repression 22 . The atomic binding mode between CsrA and the RBS RNA has been structurally investigated with the pseudomonas CsrA homolog of RsmE 23 . Although the structure of E. coli CsrA bound with RNA remains unavailable thus far, the E. coli CsrA and P. fluorescens RsmE share high sequence identity and conserved structural fold. In addition, previous mutagenesis studies identified two regions in E. coli CsrA (residues 2-7 and 40-47) that are important for its RNA binding avidity in vivo 39 . These two regions fall in good accordance with the structural observations in the RsmE/RNA complex structure. We therefore believe E. coli CsrA shares a similar RNA binding mode to that of RsmE. In such a context, we compared the structure of CesT/Re-CsrA with that of RsmE bound with an 5\u2032-A / U CANGGANG U / A -3\u2032 RNA (corresponding to the RBS sequence of the hcnA gene, PDB code: 2JPP) to learn the possible CsrA-modulation mechanism by CesT. In the RsmE dimer, two RNA moieties individually bound to the \u03b21\u2032/\u03b24/\u03b25 and its symmetrical \u03b21/\u03b24\u2032/ \u03b25\u2032 barrel-patches, defining two identical RNA binding sites (Fig. 5a) . The CesT molecule also engages extensively with the \u03b21\u2032, \u03b24, and \u03b25 strands in Re-CsrA (Fig. 5a) . Superimposition of the two structures on the Re-CsrA/RsmE proteins revealed an extensively overlapped region between the RNA binding site in RsmE and the CesT binding site in CsrA (Fig. 5a) . The binding of CesT to CsrA should therefore competitively inhibits the engagement of CsrA to mRNA, thereby relieving the CsrAmediated translation repression. To further demonstrate the inhibition of CsrA/mRNA interactions by CesT, we performed an RNA-based motility shift assay (RMSA) using a previously reported RNA molecule derived from the 5\u2032UTR of the nleA transcript with the sequence of 5\u2032-CACUAAUAAUAUCAAUG-GAUUGAUAUUAUUAAUG-3\u2032 5 . While CsrA is able to effectively bind the RNA molecule, addition of CesT indeed antagonizes the binding of CsrA to RNA (Fig. 5b) . Similar results have also been observed in a previous study using the GST fusion protein of CesT 5 .",

In order to investigate, whether polymerization of the CesT/CsrA complex could contribute to CsrA repression by CesT, we performed a comparative RMSA experiment using the CsrA WT + C del mixture (WT CsrA mixing with CsrA-C del in a 1:1 molar ratio) and Re-CsrA, which were first pre-incubated with RNA and then compared for the inhibition efficiencies of the CsrA/RNA interactions by CesT in parallel. In this testing system, the CsrA WT + C del mixture could create equal amounts of the individual intact (containing the C-terminal helix) and the incomplete (lacking the C-terminal helix) ligand-binding sites to the Re-CsrA fusion protein of the same molar quantity. The CesT/CsrA polymerization, however, would only occur in the former case where WT CsrA is present. While the WT + C del mixture is similarly capable of binding to the RNA molecule as Re-CsrA, the inhibition of CsrA/RNA binding by CesT with WT + C del (in which case CesT would polymerize with CsrA) is apparently more effective than that with Re-CsrA (in which case CesT would form uniform complexes with Re-CsrA) (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). These results therefore revealed an interesting notion that the CesT/CsrA polymerization could benefit the effective repression of CsrA by CesT.",

In the A/E pathogens, including EPEC, EHEC, and the murine-specific Citrobacter rodentium (CR), a recent study showed that the T3SS also functions to trigger posttranscriptional remodeling of gene expression upon cell attachment by modulating the CsrA activity via the T3SS specific chaperone of CesT 5 . Delineation the molecular basis of CesT/CsrA recognition, which links T3SS with the postattachment signaling in bacteria, is therefore of vital importance in understanding the pathogenesis of these pathogens. In this study, we systematically investigated the CesT/CsrA binding features using the proteins derived from EPEC and have atomically characterized their interface residues involved in the protein engagement. It is notable that these amino acids are absolutely conserved among EPEC, EHEC, and CR (Supplementary Fig. 5a, 5b) . These bacteria therefore should share a common CesT/CsrA binding mode as illustrated with the EPEC protein pair. The canonical function of CesT is to facilitate the translocation of a wide variety of effector proteins from E. coli to host cells via T3SS [6] [7] [8] [9] . In bacteria, prior to effector-translocation, CesT would form stable complexes with its effectors. It is notable that the CrsA modulation mediated by CesT occurs only after the attachment of E. coli to host cells 5 . This phenomenon is highly indicative of a competitive binding between the effector molecules and CsrA to CesT. As a muticargo chaperone, CesT was initially identified as an intrinsic binding partner for the Tir molecule 6 . Previous studies have shown that an amphipathic \u03b1-helical region that corresponds to helix \u03b13 in the CesT structure is intimately involved in Tir binding 40 . This \u03b13 helix, according to the complex structure solved in this study, also participates extensively in the interactions with CsrA. The observation seems to justify a competitive relationship between CsrA and Tir.",

These structures revealed a common binding mode such that a major binding interface involves an unfolded linear epitope (denoted the \u03b2motif) in the effector forming an intermolecular \u03b2-sheet with the chaperone. The chaperone/effector binding, such as in the SipA/InvB complex of Salmonella 13 , could be further stabilized by a folded globular effector-domain which interacts with chaperone mainly via hydrophilic interactions. It is notable that CsrA remains in a fully folded state and relies on an extensive polar-contact network for CesT binding. The binding mode parallels the CesT/CsrA interactions with, but only with, the globular protein-protein interactions in the chaperone/effector pairs. This could indicate a priority for the CesT/effector engagement over the interactions between CesT and CsrA. It is interesting that a previous study demonstrated a hierarchical effector-delivery mode in which the expression and secretion of Tir are prior to the efficient secretion of other effectors 10 . We believe the CesT/CsrA engagement should follow the same hierarchical pattern such that delivery of Tir and possibly also other effector proteins into the host cell-cytosol releases CesT for CsrA binding.",

It should be noted that an alternative dimer form (resembling the dimer form B observed in our structure) can be reconstructed in that N-domain swapped structure, except that the N-terminal \u03b11loop-\u03b21 module is from a different molecule in the crystal. It is therefore proposed that CesT might also form dimers similar to other unswapped T3SS chaperones in the absence of a domain-swap event 11 . In the current study, we provided solid structural evidence, with the form B dimeric architecture observed in our structure, that such a dimer form indeed exists and is responsible for CsrA engagement. It should be noted that with distinct dimer-assembly patterns, only the dimer form B, but not form A, is able to build integral CsrA binding sites in CesT. In support of this, a previous NMR investigation on CesT also indicates the presence of such a dimer form in solution 12 . In addition to binding to multiple effectors as a universal chaperone, CesT was also shown to play important roles in effector secretion 7, 10, 41 . It is noteworthy that the ability to facilitate secretion by CesT is allocated to the distant C-terminal region of the protein, which is proposed to exhibit a distinct \u03b1-helical structure 41 . Consistent with these previous reports, our structure indeed shows that the protein contains an extra helix (\u03b14) at the C-terminus and that this helix is of functional importance in CsrA binding. We therefore believe the dimer form B of CesT represents a biologically relevant form at least in physiological niches of interacting with CsrA and effector secretion. It remains unknown, however, if the chaperone molecule interacts with its effectors via dimer form A or form B, which should be studied in the future.",

These sRNAs will occupy the RNA binding site in CsrA, thereby competitively inhibiting the interactions between CsrA and mRNAs 23, 26, 27 . Although the sRNA-dependent CsrA modulation has been comprehensively studied, the regulation of CsrA activity by a protein ligand is only emerging in recent years. A previous study reported the structure of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans CsrA bound with FliW 43 , which revealed that FliW allosterically antagonizes CsrA in a non-competitive manner. CesT is a newly identified proteinaceous CsrA modulator in EPEC and EHEC. In contrast to FliW, our structure shows that CesT binds to CsrA at a site that extensively overlaps with that for RNA engagement, justifying again a competitive modulation mode as with sRNAs. CesT is therefore mechanistically bearing a much more resemblance to sRNAs than to the protein ligand of FliW.",

We noted that despite the competitions, obvious inhibition of the CsrA/RNA interactions by CesT was only observed when CesT concentration is high (e.g., with two fold excess of CesT or higher) but not when the CesT/CsrA molar ratio is 1:1 (Fig. 5b) , echoing the relatively-low affinity between CesT and CsrA. It is notable that CsrA and its regulatory sRNAs (CsrB and CsrC) form an auto-regulatory circuitry in EHEC and EPEC, enabling the system to be accurately modulated 19, 33 . CesT as a T3SS chaperone protein, however, is not involved in and thereby modulated by this Csr circuitry. In such a context, we believe the relatively low-binding affinity between CesT and CsrA is likely a biological way of enabling EHEC and EPEC to respond only after the cell-surface attachment of the bacteria when high concentration of CesT is available after effector secretion. It is also noteworthy that both CesT and CsrA created two ligand binding sites in their homodimers, which can lead to complex polymerization and subsequently the formation of higher aggregates in solution via sequential stacking of the two protein dimers. It is interesting that our comparative RMSA analyses showed that the inhibition of CsrA/RNA binding by CesT is more effective when with WT CsrA than with Re-CsrA, revealing that CesT/CsrA polymerization represents a contributing factor that can benefit CsrA repression by CesT (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). We note the very similar binding affinities between WT CsrA (148 nM) and Re-CsrA (151 nM) to CesT, the increased repression efficiency observed with WT CsrA could therefore indicate a possible cooperative polymerization process between CesT and CsrA. We believe that this might represent an efficient way of sequestering CsrA by CesT to enable the bacteria to quickly adapt to life on the epithelium surface.",

For CesT, the model structure was first truncated to include only residues I36-G131 prior to molecular replacement. The remaining CesT amino acids, including those consisting of the N-terminal \u03b11loop-\u03b21 module and the extended C-terminal motif, were then manually rebuilt in Coot during refinement. For refinement, initial restrained rigid-body refinement was performed using REFMAC5 47 , which was followed by manual rebuilding and adjustment in COOT 48 . Further refinement was carried out with Phenix 49 . The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed through the program PROCHECK 50 . The final data processing and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . All structural figures were generated using Pymol (http:// www.pymol.org).",

The native domain-swapped CsrA-dimer structure (PDB code: 2BTI) is shown in cartoon representation to highlight the \u03b2-barrel core and the terminal \u03b1-helix which are bordered at R44/E45. Re-CsrA is a recombinant CsrA dimer, composed of a C-helix-deleted CsrA (CsrA-C del ) connecting via a linker to a full length CsrA. Both CsrA and Re-CsrA are initially expressed as GST-fusion proteins, which are then enzymatically digested to remove the GST-tags. b Analyses of the CesT/CsrA and CesT/Re-CsrA complexes by analytical gel filtration. The 280nm absorbance curves and the SDS-PAGE migration profiles of the indicated proteins are shown. Dashed lines indicate the standard molecular weight markers. c An SPR assay characterizing the real-time binding kinetics of CsrA and Re-CsrA to immobilized CesT. The recorded profiles are shown. The affinity is calculated using the Bivalent-Analyte model for the native CsrA and the steady-state affinity model for Re-CsrA, respectively. The calculated-fit curve is shown as dashed lines for CsrA and as a built-in panel for Re-CsrA.
