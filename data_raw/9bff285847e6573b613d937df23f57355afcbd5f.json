Since it is dispensable for HCV RNA replication, the non-structural viral protein NS2 is suggested to play a central role in HCV particle assembly. However, despite genetic evidences, we have almost no understanding about NS2 protein-protein interactions and their role in the production of infectious particles. Here, we used co-immunoprecipitation and/or fluorescence resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy analyses to study the interactions between NS2 and the viroporin p7 and the HCV glycoprotein E2. In addition, we used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis as well as other mutations in the context of an infectious virus to investigate the functional role of NS2 in HCV assembly. Finally, the subcellular localization of NS2 and several mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Our data demonstrate molecular interactions between NS2 and p7 and E2. Furthermore, we show that, in the context of an infectious virus, NS2 accumulates over time in endoplasmic reticulum-derived dotted structures and colocalizes with both the envelope glycoproteins and components of the replication complex in close proximity to the HCV core protein and lipid droplets, a location that has been shown to be essential for virus assembly. We show that NS2 transmembrane region is crucial for both E2 interaction and subcellular localization. Moreover, specific mutations in core, envelope proteins, p7 and NS5A reported to abolish viral assembly changed the subcellular localization of NS2 protein. Together, these observations indicate that NS2 protein attracts the envelope proteins at the assembly site and it crosstalks with non-structural proteins for virus assembly.",

However, with the development of a cell culture system that enables a relatively efficient amplification of HCV (HCVcc) [7, 8, 9] , all the steps of the HCV life cycle can be investigated. Due to the accumulation of HCV core protein around lipid droplets (LDs) (reviewed in [10] ), a role of these lipid bodies in HCV assembly has been suspected for a long time. Moreover, it has recently been shown that viral non-structural proteins like NS5A and NS3 and double stranded viral RNA are also present around LDs [11, 12] . The association between core and LDs seems to play a role in the recruitment of the other viral proteins and for virus production [12, 13] . Furthermore, NS5A plays a double role in both replication and assembly processes as a potential switch between these two steps [14, 15, 16, 17] .",

            "text": "Since it is dispensable for HCV RNA replication and it does not seem to be incorporated into viral particles [6] , NS2 has been suspected to be involved in the assembly process of HCV particle. Recently, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis has been obtained [18, 19, 20] . Although the role of NS2 in the assembly process remains elusive, some data suggest that NS2 might interact with viral partners involved in virion morphogenesis. Indeed, construction of chimeric viruses between different genotypes identified the C-terminus of the first transmembrane segment of NS2 as the optimum crossover point [21] . Thus, a genetic interaction was implied between the N-terminus of NS2 and the upstream structural proteins. In the context of a chimeric virus containing genotype 1a and 2a sequences, adaptive mutations in E1, p7, NS2 and NS3 were identified, also suggesting genetic interactions between these proteins [22] . Moreover, a detailed rescue mutant analysis recently showed genetic interactions between NS2, E1E2 and NS3-4A [23] . However, despite these genetic analyses we have almost no understanding about NS2 interactions with other viral proteins and the role of these interactions in the production of infectious particles. Here, we report molecular interactions between NS2 and p7 and E2 proteins. Using a functional HCVcc virus with a reporter epitope at the N-terminus of NS2, we found that NS2 accumulates in dotted structures derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and colocalizes with E1, E2, NS3 and NS5A in close proximity to the core protein and LDs. Mutations and deletions in the p7-NS2 region affecting the subcellular localization of NS2 and its physical protein-protein interactions abolished viral assembly. Moreover, mutations in other viral proteins reported to inhibit the assembly process induced consistent changes in NS2 subcellular localization. Together, these data suggest that p7, NS2 and E2 form a functional unit which drives the proteins in the proximity of the LDs where NS2 crosstalks with other viral proteins during the virion assembly process.",

For a more refined analysis, we also used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis, a technique which has been shown to disrupt helix-helix interactions in a membrane environment [26, 27, 28, 29] . As illustrated in Figure 1C for the first transmembrane segment of NS2, this approach is based on the fact that insertion of a single amino acid into a transmembrane helix displaces the residues on the N-terminal side of the insertion by 110u relative to those on the C-terminal side of the insertion. The subsequent perturbation of the residue sidechain distribution could disrupt a potential helix-helix packing interface involving residues on both sides of the insertion. Such mutations are therefore expected to disrupt helix-helix interactions between the transmembrane segments of NS2 and/or between NS2 and other putative partners like p7 or E1E2.",

Understanding the major steps of the life cycle of this virus is essential to developing new and more efficient antiviral molecules. Virus assembly is the least understood step of the HCV life cycle. Growing experimental evidence indicates that, in addition to the physical virion components, the HCV non-structural proteins are intimately involved in orchestrating morphogenesis. Since it is dispensable for HCV RNA replication, the nonstructural viral protein NS2 is suggested to play a central role in HCV particle assembly. Molecular interactions between NS2 and other HCV proteins were demonstrated. Furthermore, NS2 was shown to accumulate over time in endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures and to colocalize with the viral envelope glycoproteins and viral components of the replication complex in close proximity to the HCV core protein and lipid droplets. Importantly, specific mutations within NS2 that affected HCV infectivity could also alter the subcellular localization of NS2 protein and its interactions, suggesting that this subcellular localization and its interactions are essential for HCV particle assembly. Altogether, these observations indicate that NS2 protein plays an important role in connecting different viral components that are essential for virus assembly.

Furthermore, alanine insertions also drastically affected the viral production.

However, the level of expression of HCV proteins was higher for the JFH-HA control in this particular experiment.

The quantity of core protein in supernatants decreased drastically as compared to wild-type, paralleling the decrease in infectivity ( Figure 2B ). It has to be noted that for the mutants showing a residual infectivity (A16, A41 and RR/QQ), the release of core was at the same level as the dead mutants (DTM12, A82 and Dp7). This likely reflects a difference of sensitivity between the two assays. Then, we measured the viral RNA in the supernatants by qRT-PCR as previously described [17] . For all the alanine insertions, the release of viral RNA was close to the background level observed for the assembly-deficient control viruses ( Figure S1B -lower panel), indicating a defect in particle secretion. These data suggest that either the process of assembly is affected at an early stage or the secretion of assembled infectious particles is impaired. To answer this question, we compared the intra and extracellular level of the core protein ( Figure 2B ). The ratio between intra and extracellular core was similar to JFH-Dp7-HA which was shown to be defective in early assembly steps. We also measured the intracellular infectivity of the alanine mutants in the Rluc reporter viruses context as previously reported [20] . As shown in Figure S1B (middle panel), there was no accumulation of intracellular infectivity for any of the mutants. These results suggest that mutations in the transmembrane domain of NS2 prevent the assembly process rather than the secretion of particles.",

This RR/QQ mutation is believed to abolish the ion channel activity of p7, and it induces a drastic decrease in virus production as previously reported [32, 35] and confirmed by us as shown in Figure 2A . As shown in Figure 2C (JFH-Dp7-HA and JFH-RR/QQ-HA), E2 and NS2 proteins migrated at the expected molecular mass, indicating that the polyprotein was correctly processed in these viruses. However, the two mutations had no significant effect on E2-NS2 interaction ( Figure 2C JFH-Dp7-HA and JFH-RR/QQ-HA), suggesting that p7 does not modulate E2-NS2 interaction.",

NS2 presented an ER-like reticulated pattern, and in some cells, accumulated in dotted structures ( Figure 3A and data not shown). The number of these NS2-positive dot-like structures increased over time, suggesting a transition from an initial reticulate pattern to these dotted structures.

Importantly, the structures containing both NS2 and NS5A were observed in close proximity to LDs ( Figure 4A ). This is illustrated by the presence of magenta dots (red NS2 and blue NS5A) in the proximity of LD (green). Finally, as observed with the LDs, NS2 dots were also found in close proximity to core protein ( Figure S2 ), and as expected this association was observed in close proximity to LDs ( Figure 4B ). As shown in Figure 4B , core (blue) is tightly associated to LD (green) as the LD becomes cyan due to colocalization, NS2 (red) localizes in regions juxtaposed to the cyan LD ( Figure 4B ). Relying on the spatial proximity of NS2 dots, core, E1E2, NS3, NS5A proteins and LDs, we speculated that NS2 present in these structures is involved in the assembly process. Thus, we established some criteria of functionality for NS2 positive structures. They have to localize in the proximity of LDs and core protein and more importantly to colocalize with NS5A protein, which we used as a criteria for quantification purposes.",

This different pattern was indeed observed in approximately 1 to 3% of the cells at 72h post-infection or postelectroporation. These structures colocalized less with ER markers and they overlapped with ERGIC-53, a marker of the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment [36] ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, these NS2 dots were detected in close proximity to the ER exit sites, which were identified by markers of the COP II coatomer, Sec31 and p125 [37, 38] ( Figure S3 and data not shown). However, cells containing these NS2 positive structures showed dramatic alterations of the secretory compartments as observed by immunofluorescence analysis of ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi morphology using ERGIC-53 and GM130 as markers ( Figure S3 ). It is worth noting that NS2 did not colocalize with NS3 or NS5A and it was not found in the proximity of core and LDs in these cells ( Figure S3 ). Due to these alterations, it is unlikely that these cells are involved in the production of infectious virus. The NS2 mutations affect the viral secretion, but not the replication capacity. Huh-7 cells were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different JFH-1 derived mutants. At 72h post-electroporation, the amount of extracellular and intracellular core antigen was determined in supernatants and cell lysates, respectively. Error bars indicate SD from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate. (C) HA-NS2 co-immunoprecipitates with E2. Huh-7 cells were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different JFH-1 derived mutants. At 72h post-electroporation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-E2 antibody. The presence of E2, and HA-NS2 in electroporated cells was confirmed by Western blotting and the actin content was also analyzed to verify that equal amounts of cell lysates have been loaded. It has to be noted that the E2 band corresponds to both E2 and E2p7 proteins. However, in the absence of p7, the E2-p7 form is absent. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001278.g002",

The kinetics of virion production and the percentage of cells presenting NS2/NS5A positive dots showed a high correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.9. To exclude the possibility that the NS2 phenotype depends on the cell culture adaptive mutations, we performed a similar experiment with a virus that does not contain the mutations. As for the adaptive mutant, virus production in the absence of mutation paralleled the NS2/NS5A dots formation with a significant correlation coefficient (data not shown). These data reinforce the idea that NS2/ NS5A positive dots are involved in the virus production process.",

As shown in Figure 4D , we could identify clusters of gold particles in the proximity of LDs. Moreover, two of the clusters are lying on preserved ER bilayers. For one of the clusters of gold particles, a connection between the ER bilayer and the LDs could be observed ( Figure 4D ). Thus, the immunoelectron microscopy confirms the juxtaposition between NS2 dots and LDs in a 0.2mm range, which is consistent with the observations in confocal microscopy. It has to be noted that gold particles were detected on both sides of the membrane even if the HA epitope is supposed to be located in the ER lumen. This is compatible with the length of two antibodies (primary+secondary) since the gold particles were never further away than 30 nm from the membrane. However, we cannot exclude a double topology for NS2 as recently suggested [39] .",

Moreover, there was no colocalization between the truncated NS2 and the E2 glycoprotein ( Figure 5B ), which correlates with the lack of interaction between the two proteins ( Figure 2C ). Then, we analyzed the subcellular localization of NS2 for the alanine insertion mutants.

The proline residues 138 and 143 in domain D2 of the core protein are crucial for virus production and core recruitment to LDs [13, 41] . Furthermore, the mutation of these proline residues has been previously shown to prevent the core induced recruitment of NS5A to the LDs [12] . Therefore, we introduced these mutations in the context of JFH-HA virus ( Figure 6 , JFH-HA-PP). As previously reported [13] , the mutation prevented the production of infectious virions ( Figure 9A ), and the core protein was not redistributed to LDs, which in turn remained spread in the cytoplasm rather than the perinuclear localization induced by a functional core protein ( Figure S4 ). As shown in Figure 6 , in the context of this mutation, NS2 protein maintained the capacity to accumulate in dotted structures that colocalized with NS5A. In contrast to the wild-type, NS2 dotted structures were not found in the vicinity of LDs in the context of the PP mutation, suggesting that NS2 does not have the signals to localize by itself around the LDs ( Figure S4 ). Importantly, in this context, the number of cells presenting NS2 dotted structures increased tremendously in comparison to the wild-type ( Figure 6B ). These observations suggest that the PP mutation induces a block in the assembly process, which favors the accumulation of NS2 protein in the dotted structures.",

The envelope proteins play a crucial role in the assembly of enveloped viruses, which can be due for some viruses to the capacity of the envelope proteins to establish lateral interactions and to generate a pushing force necessary for the budding process [43] . A deletion in the envelope region would therefore block the assembly process as shown by an in-frame deletion of 351 amino acids in the envelope proteins region [7] . In the context of our JFH-HA virus, this deletion mutant is also fully replicative, and it does not produce infectious particles (data not shown). To further understand the interplay between NS2 and HCV envelope glycoproteins, we analyzed the subcellular localization of NS2 protein in the context of the E1E2 deletion. In this context, NS2 localized in NS5A positive structures juxtaposed to the LDs and core protein (Figure 6 and S4) . Interestingly, as for the JFH-HA-PP virus, the number of cells presenting NS2 dotted structures also increased in the case of JFH-DE1E2-HA, correlating also with a block in the assembly process favoring an accumulation of NS2 dotted structures ( Figure 6B ).",

            "text": "Other partners than p7 are likely necessary for NS2 accumulation in dotted structures. Indeed, as shown in Figure 5 , A41 and DTM12 mutants, which fail to interact with E2, also present a drastically reduced number of NS2 dotted structures. This suggests that NS2-E2 interaction might be crucial for NS2 subcellular localization. Thus, one additional determinant could be represented by the transmembrane domain of E2, which is most likely the interacting region with NS2 due to topological constraints. In order to check this hypothesis, we used both JFH-HA and JFH-DE1E2-HA constructs in which we replaced the transmembrane region of E2 with the autoprotease 2A from foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) (JFH-DTME2-HA and JFH-DE1E2TME2-HA)( Figure S1 ). We first verified that a proper processing of the polyprotein mediated by FMDV 2A protease has occurred in these constructs. To check our constructs, we analyzed the molecular mass of E2 following deglycosylation with EndoH or PNGase endoglycosidases. As shown in Figure 6C , E2 from JFH-HA and JFH-DTME2-HA presented a similar molecular mass after deglycosylation with EndoH, suggesting that the FMDV 2A protease is functional since FMDV 2A and the transmembrane domain of E2 have similar sizes. Indeed, if FMDV 2A protease had not been functional, we would have observed a difference of 7kD corresponding to the molecular mass of unprocessed p7 ( Figure 6C and data not shown) . Interestingly, in contrast to the wild-type envelope protein, the truncated E2 did not interact with NS2 ( Figure 6D ). Furthermore, in contrast to what was observed for JFH-HA and JFH-DE1E2-HA ( Figure 6A ), NS2 protein of the DTME2 mutant presented an ER like pattern and the formation of NS2 dotted structures was prevented ( Figure 6A and B) . Similar data were also obtained with JFH-DE1E2TME2-HA construct ( Figure 6B ). Thus, it seems that p7-NS2 and the transmembrane domain of E2 form a functional unit that targets these proteins to NS5A positive structures.",

NS5A is recruited through direct interaction by the core protein around LDs where its domain III is involved in the assembly process potentially by its phosphorylation [14, 16, 17] . By deletion mutagenesis, Tellinghuisen et al. identified a cluster of serine residues at positions 452, 454 and 457, which are crucial for virus production [17] . Furthermore, by alanine scanning mutagenesis, Masaki et al. reported that the same serine cluster is involved in the direct interaction between NS5A and core protein [16] . While Tellinghuisen et al. reported that serine 457 alone is essential for virus production, Masaki et al. showed that only double mutants had a significant impact on virus production [16, 17] . The apparent contradiction might be explained by the different viruses and time points for virus production assessment. While Tellinghuisen et al. used a chimeric virus consisting of the structural proteins of J6 strain up to NS2 protein, Masaki et al. used the wild type JFH strain [16, 17] . Thus, we constructed the two mutants in the context of our JFH-HA virus -JFH-S/A-HA and JFH-3BS/A-HA, respectively. We analyzed the phenotype of the mutants as well as the polyprotein processing. The results fitted the literature with JFH-S/A-HA virus infectivity moderately reduced at 72h and JFH-3BS/A-HA profoundly impaired in infectious virus production, while the replication and protein integrity were unaltered ( Figure 9A , B, C). As reported, we showed that JFH-S/A-HA and JFH-3BS/A-HA present less hyperphosphorylated NS5A ( Figure 9C) . Surprisingly, for both mutants, NS2 localized mainly in an ER-like pattern and the number of cells with NS2/NS5A dots decreased dramatically ( Figure 9D , E). The serine 457 may be replaced by an aspartate residue, which mimics a phosphoserine [17] . We therefore introduced the same mutation (JFH-S/D-HA) and as reported the virus titers were restored at wild-type levels ( Figure 9A ). Interestingly, this mutant partially recovered the NS2 subcellular localization both qualitatively and quantitatively ( Figure 9D , E). Together, these results suggest that NS5A phosphorylation might stabilize the NS2 dotted structures in the assembly process.",

As expected, the structural proteins are essential in the virus makeup [7] . The scenario gets more complicated with the involvement of non-structural proteins in the assembly process. The p7 polypeptide, NS2, NS3, NS4B, NS5A were reported to be involved in viral assembly [14, 17, 20, 22, 32, 48] . However, the mechanism of the complex interplay between the structural and non-structural proteins towards the virion production is not understood. In this paper, we provide evidence for molecular interactions between NS2, p7 and E2, respectively. Furthermore, we show that NS2 accumulates over time in ER-derived dotted structures and colocalizes with the envelope glycoproteins and components of the replication complex in close proximity to the core protein and LDs. Characterized assembly deficient mutants in both structural and non-structural proteins present qualitative and quantitative modifications in NS2 Altogether, these observations indicate that NS2 protein crosstalks with both structural and non-structural proteins during virus assembly.",

Based on this assumption, we wanted to characterize NS2 interactions with p7 and E2 by deletion and chimeric mutants. Both NS2-E2 interaction and NS2-p7 interaction were mapped in the transmembrane region of NS2 as expected. However, since the lack of p7 does not affect the E2-NS2 interaction, we could imagine that NS2 uses separate domains to interact with p7 and the envelope proteins. Interestingly, when we deleted the transmembrane region of E2, the NS2-E2 interaction was impaired and the NS2 subcellular localization changed. Altogether, these observations suggest that p7, the transmembrane domain of NS2 and the transmembrane domain of E2 contain signals which act synergistically to direct the NS2 protein towards the NS5A positive membranes in the LD proximity.",

As shown for lactose permease, single alanine residue insertions into transmembrane helices of a polytopic membrane protein can be highly disruptive to protein structure and function due to their effects on intramolecular helix-helix interactions [26] . Furthermore, within the same protein, different transmembrane helices can have differential sensitivities to single residue insertions [26] . In the case of NS2, our data indicate that an insertion in the third putative transmembrane helix strongly reduces the stability of the protein, suggesting a drastic alteration of NS2 structure by this mutation. The decrease in infectivity for the mutations in the first two transmembrane helices also indicates a drastic alteration in NS2 function that can be linked to local alteration of its structure, as suggested by the change in subcellular localization of NS2 mutant A41. Finally, the drastic decrease in infectivity of mutant A16 in spite of NS2 localization in dotted structures indicates that the subcellular localization of NS2 in these structures is not sufficient by itself for infectivity. Rather, it likely needs to play additional function(s) at the site of virus assembly and such function(s) would be disrupted by the A16 mutation. One explanation could be that a weak E2-NS2 interaction as seen for A41 is not able to direct the p7-NS2 unit to the LDs and a potential strong interaction as for A16 does not allow the p7-NS2 unit to release the envelope proteins heterodimer to the assembly site and the subsequent recycling/dissociation of the unit.",

Since the LD/ER interface is considered as the potential particle assembly site [12] , NS2 localization close to the LDs is expected to correlate with its function in a late step of the viral life cycle. Interestingly, NS2 accumulation in dotted structures parallels the colocalization of NS2 with NS5A, NS3 proteins and most likely the replication complex. Moreover, the NS2 dotted structures are juxtaposed to the core protein and colocalize with the envelope proteins E1 and E2. Thus the NS2 dots contain all the assembly players and are located in the microenvironment of the LDs, the proposed virus assembly site. It is worth mentioning that the formation of NS2 dotted structures is not due to a non-specific effect of the viral genome replication since some of our mutants showing the same replication rate had very different subcellular localizations of NS2 (e.g. A16 vs. A41). It seems rather that the formation of NS2 related dots represents a transition rather than an end state in a productive assembly process. Indeed, mutations in core (JFH-HA-PP) or in the envelope proteins (JFH-DE1E2-HA) induced an obvious increase in the number of cells presenting NS2 dots. This could mean that the p7-NS2-E1E2 complexes pre-exist in the NS5A positive subcompartment. In addition, the core-mediated redistribution of LDs could induce the recruitment of the assembly components to LDs followed by the envelope protein incorporation into the virion during the budding process. Finally, after budding, NS2 might relocate to another subcellular compartment or be degraded. This scenario is supported by the fact that NS2 dots accumulate around the LDs and core protein when the envelope proteins are deleted, which is expected to inhibit the lateral interactions between the envelope proteins [42] , preventing the budding process to occur.",

We show here that mutations in NS5A, which are reported to affect the phosphorylation status of the protein, abolish the accumulation of NS2 in dotted structures. Moreover, we could partially restore the phenotype by an aspartate mutant, which mimics phosphoserine. Thus, NS2 colocalization with NS5A is favored by the phosphorylation state of the latter. It is possible that NS5A charged state enhances a potential NS2-RC interaction, which translates in NS2 dot formation. Removing the charges would shift the interaction equilibrium and would affect the virus production kinetics in different extents depending on the number of charges and virus strain. Hence, if serine 457 is replaced, the virus titers are moderately reduced at 72h. In contrast, removing serine residues 452, 454, 457 determines a profound defect in infectious virus production. However, there is no NS2 accumulation for either of the two mutants. Thus, the NS2 dots may represent transition states in the assembly process. Indeed, some mutations may prevent the arrival of dots components to NS5A structures (JFH-DTM12-HA, JFH-A41-HA, JFH-Dp7-HA and JFH-DTME2-HA). Alternatively, other mutations may block the post-electroporation and labeled with anti-HA and anti-NS5A antibodies. Cells showing at least 3 dots NS2/NS5A positive were considered positive for NS2 dotted structures. The results were expressed as percentage of total counted cells (at least 228). Error bars indicate SD from at least two independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001278.g009 assembly and stabilize them (JFH-HA-PP, JFH-DE1E2-HA). If we combine a mutation from the former category (JFH-DTME2-HA) with one from the latter (JFH-DE1E2-HA) in the mutant JFH-DE1E2TME2-HA, we prevent the NS2 dots formation. This suggests that the formation of NS2 complexes and their arrival to the NS5A structures precede the accumulation of NS2 around the LDs during the assembly process. Furthermore, changes in the phosphorylation state of NS5A could regulate the stability of NS2 dots and virion production efficacy.",

Upon viral genome translation and polyprotein processing, formation of different complexes occurs: the E1E2 native heterodimer, the p7NS2 unit and the RC. The core protein and other viral proteins (e.g. NS4B) create the LD-ER microenvironment by redistribution of the LDs and intracellular membranes. The LDs surrounded by core protein are recruited to the RC. E1E2 complex interacts with p7NS2 unit and E1E2p7NS2 arrives to NS5A positive membranes in the proximity of LDs due to a combination of signals in p7, NS2 and E2 proteins. NS5A switches from the replication to assembly mode by phosphorylation, which stabilizes the presence of NS2 in dotted structures favoring the assembly process ( Figure 10 ). Finally, our data indicate a crucial role played by NS2 in the assembly process and highlight the complexity of the mechanism of its action. In conclusion, NS2 emerges as an essential mediator between the structural and nonstructural proteins in HCV assembly process.",

Wakita (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) [7] .

Furthermore, the Figure 10 . Model of NS2 role in the assembly process. Upon viral polyprotein translation and processing, three viral modules are formed: the core protein (C), the replication complex (RC) and the E1E2p7NS2 complex. E1E2p7NS2 complex assembles through the interaction of E1E2 heterodimer and p7NS2 unit (4) and migrates close to the RC independently of core protein due to signals present in p7NS2 and E2 (3) . The core protein localizes around the LDs (1) where it recruits the RC by core-NS5A interaction (2). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001278.g010 E1 sequence encoding residues 196 TSSSYMVTNDC has been modified to reconstitute the A4 epitope (SSGLYHVTNDC) [56] as described [31] . Overlapping PCR was used to construct all the JFH1 mutants. The JFH GND -Luc construct was obtained by inserting the previously described GND mutation [7] in JFH-Luc plasmid. The JFH-HA construct was obtained by inserting the sequence of the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) followed by a GGG linker at the N-terminus of NS2. The JFH-Dp7-HA keeps the first 2 amino acids of p7 followed by the HA tag sequence and the SGG linker at the N-terminus of NS2. The JFH-DE1E2-Luc plasmid has been described previously [31] . It contains an in-frame deletion of amino acids 217-567. JFH-DTM12-HA has the first two transmembrane segments of NS2 deleted as described [19] , in the context of our JFH-HA virus.

The least square fitting method was used to describe the non linear responses commonly observed in FLIM analysis [60, 61, 62] . We used TITAN (''in the house'' designed) and SPCImage (Becker and Hickl) software for advanced FLIM data analysis and curve fittings. In order to reduce the impact of background and improve the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), we excluded from our analysis the pixels located in the nuclear region or from ER-like regions where the donor protein was overexpressed. After setting these thresholds, we made a summation of all the pixels of interest to achieve a fitting statistically significant for the TITAN software. To compensate the possible large scattering of points in the curve, we used a Newton trust region algorithm [63] and an extraction of mean lifetimes was performed in order to determine the FRET events from the multi-exponential model [64] .",

Figure S1 Mutations in NS2 affect viral assembly. (A) Schematic representation of the constructs used in this study. (B) Characterization of the phenotypes of HCV mutants. Huh7 cells were electroporated with the indicated genomes. At 72h post-electroporation supernatants were collected and cells were lysed. Replication was determined as the ratio between Rluc counts at 72h and 4h, respectively (see Replication panel). In parallel, virusproducing cells were washed and lysed by repetitive cycles of freeze and thaw. Extracellular (black bars) and intracellular (white bars) infectivities were determined by inoculating na\u00efve cells and measuring the Rluc activities at 72h post-inoculation (see Infectivity panel). To measure viral secretion, mutated HCV genomes were delivered to Huh-7 cells. At two days postelectroporation, cells were trypsinized, washed once and reseeded into cell culture dishes. HCV RNA levels in cell lysates and in supernatants were extracted 5 days after electroporation, and titrated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (see Secretion panel). Viral secretion was considered equivalent to the genomic viral RNA released in the media. Error bars indicate SD from at least two independent experiments. (C) NS2 mutants protein stability. Huh-7 cells were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different JFH-1 derived mutants. At 72h post-electroporation, cells were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-E2, anti-HA or anti-NS2. The actin content was also analyzed to verify that equal amounts of cell lysates have been loaded.
