            "text": "Many studies [3, 4] have shown that HAPE is a major disease that often affects nonacclimatized healthy individuals who ascend to high altitudes. Therefore, early diagnosis of HAPE is essential to initiate early treatment of HAPE and maintain the safety of people who ascent to high altitude. Although international and Chinese criteria have been established for HAPE [5] , its early detection and diagnosis are difficult, except in the presence of typical pulmonary edema. Following the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck Yushu (Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China) on April 14, 2010 , approximately 50,000 rescuers assembled in the region. This region lies at an altitude ranging from 3700 m to 4900 m, the average altitude is 4,493 m. Although the incidence of HAPE is only 2-4%, the sudden influx of nonacclimatized rescuers to the region meant that HAPE was one of the most common life-threatening diseases at that time, even considering the effects of the earthquake, which caused 1944 deaths, with 216 people missing and 12,135 injured. HAPE can also induce psychological disorders in affected individuals. Therefore, it is essential to highlight the early diagnosis and on-site treatment of HAPE. Under the support of the National Science and Technology Program, we have conducted an extensive range of studies on HAPE intended to find effective methods for early diagnosis and clinical treatment of HAPE and, thus, improve the health and safety of individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitude.",

            "text": "It is generally not difficult for physicians to diagnose typical HAPE, which is based on medical history, symptoms, and signs including white, yellow, or pink frothy sputum, moist rales on pulmonary auscultation, and flocculent shadows on chest X-rays. However, atypical HAPE is much more difficult to diagnose. Patients usually develop atypical HAPE at altitude <3000 m, which may occur several days or longer after ascending to altitude. Symptoms differ from those of typical HAPE, such as less sputum or an absence of sputum and nonspecific findings on chest X-rays. Based on a previous study [6] , the development of HAPE can be classified into two stages from the onset to the presence of typical symptoms. The early stage is characterized by 2 Pulmonary Medicine interstitial pulmonary edema while the late stage is characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema. Patients with interstitial pulmonary edema do not usually exhibit serious dyspnea or typical signs such as pink frothy sputum, extensive moist rales, or wheezy phlegm. Thus, these patients are susceptible to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Li et al. [7] investigated the characteristics of HAPE in 482 patients. They examined the clinical symptoms and signs, and performed routine blood tests, electrocardiography, color Doppler echocardiography, chest X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) of the patients. They found that HAPE patients exhibited significant differences in these parameters compared with non-HAPE patients, and that the symptoms and signs were more obvious in HAPE patients than in non-HAPE patients. In addition, studies have revealed that oxygen treatment is more effective in HAPE than in other forms of lung injury. Therefore, some researchers have proposed that tentative oxygen treatment can be used for the early diagnosis of HAPE. Nevertheless, the most important examinations for the early diagnosis of HAPE are chest X-rays or CT. On chest X-rays, HAPE often presents as decreased pulmonary transmittance, increased or obscure lung markings, and ground glass-like changes in the lung, or patchy shadows. On CT scans, increased and enlarged lung markings, ground glass-like changes in the lung, nodule-like shadows, scattered or isolated alveolar edema of terminal bronchioles, and slim reticulate shadows can be observed.",

Thus, it is imperative to develop guidelines to standardize and optimize the treatment of HAPE. Based on the experience of several mountain sickness treatment centers and the efficacy of currently available drugs and strategies, in combination with recent advances in the treatment of HAPE, our research group proposed four regimens for early diagnosis and treatment of HAPE and conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to investigate their efficacy. A total of 400 patients with HAPE were divided into four groups and treated as follows: patients in group A received oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, and aminophylline; patients in group B-C were treated as in group A, in addition to diuresis with furosemide in group B, blood pressure-lowering with nifedipine in group C, or L-arginine in group D. The efficacy and safety of these therapeutic regimens were compared. The treatment showing greatest therapeutic efficacy was subsequently used to prepare the guidelines for the treatment of HAPE. Overall, all four regimens were effective for the treatment of HAPE [9] . However, in terms of the time to resolution of symptom and signs, the time to resolution of chest X-ray findings, and duration of hospitalization, regimen B was superior to the other regimens. Interestingly, there were no marked differences between regimens A, C, and D. Furthermore, there were no differences in the incidence of adverse effects between regimens A, B, and D, or in the liver and kidney functions between all four regimens. These findings suggest that a regimen composed of oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, aminophylline, and furosemide is effective, well tolerated, simple to follow, and thus offers a basic, standardized regimen for the treatment of HAPE Once the regimen has been selected, timely initiation of individualized treatment is a key factor that contributes towards its therapeutic efficacy. Our experience of on-site treatment of more than 300 patients with HAPE has shown that on-site individualized treatment is feasible, without increasing the risk for death [10] . Following the Yushu earthquake, the efficacy of this regimen was further confirmed as the prognosis after on-site treatment was significantly better than that after blind evacuation, which usually results in poor outcomes.",

To achieve this, the following factors are particularly important. (1) Maintain body warmth with appropriate insulation and avoid upper respiratory tract infection. Several days before ascending to high altitude, bathing should be avoided to reduce exposure to cold temperatures. (2) Avoid fatigue. Physical activity at high altitude should be performed at an intensity of no more than 60-80% of that at sea level and duration of activity should be <6 h. Similarly, the body must be given sufficient time to rest both before and during the time at high altitude.",

Unwanted emotional tension should be avoided, while optimism and aggressiveness should be maintained. (5) Patients with upper respiratory tract infection should be carefully monitored before and during the time at high altitude. However, delaying the ascent until the infection has been fully resolved is preferable. (6) Oxygen must be available at high altitude, either by maintaining high oxygen levels in living quarters or by supplying compressed oxygen tanks for use during physical activity. (7) Food and water sanitation. Diets containing high levels of carbohydrates and protein and low levels of fat are recommended. The intake of vitamins can also be increased. (9) The use of drugs such as Rhodiola rosea, Zangtianlu, Codonopsis compound tablets, Shenqi pollen tablets, and acetazolamide during the time at high altitude can also reduce the risk of HAPE.",

As outlined above, it is essential to provide sufficient nutrients, rest, and insulation against the cold, as well as to limit labor intensity and duration of labor to avoid fatigue. Shift-work is also recommended and may entail 20-30 days of work at high altitude followed by a period of rest at low altitude to provide more effective resting conditions. Shift-work also reduces the incidence of chronic mountain sickness induced by long periods of physically demanding work at high altitude. It is also essential to ensure there is an adequate medical team to enable early detection, diagnosis, and treatment, should mountain sickness of HAPE occur.",
