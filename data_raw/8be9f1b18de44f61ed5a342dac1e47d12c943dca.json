            "text": "Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broadspectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.",

In RNAi screens, genes are perturbed with small interferring RNAs (siRNAs). These are 20-25 nucleotides in length, complementary to mRNAs, and cause post-transcriptional gene silencing [1, 2] . The absence of certain host proteins has been shown to have an impact on the life cycle of pathogens [3, 4, 5] , e.g., by reducing the ability of the pathogen to grow or by enhancing it.",

            "text": "Positive-sense ssRNA viruses (in the following also called group IV viruses according to the Baltimore classification [6] ) such as the Hepatitis C virus, all share some common steps in their replication cycle. First, the virus enters the host cell and releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm. Translation of the RNA results in the expression of viral (nonstructural) proteins that assemble into a replication complex that drives the synthesis of new viral RNA. Newly synthesized genomic RNA is encapsulated by capsid protein. Eventually, new virions are assembled and released from the infected cells [7, 8, 9] . For virtually all of these steps, the virus strongly depends on host proteins due to the small RNA virus genomes with limited coding capacity. Another common feature of +RNA viruses is that their RNA synthesis takes place in specialized structures that are associated with modified host membranes [10] . In order to understand the virus-host interplay reliable identification of potential host factors involved in virus replication is crucial.",

Prioritizing host factors on a viral group level, such as the group of positive-sense ssRNA viruses, has until now not been pursued in detail, even tough it seems promising, because viruses of the same group often have very similar replication cycles. Pathogens of one group might utilize the same, or at least functionally related, host factors and cellular pathways for replication. Consequently, development of anti-viral drugs targeting common host factors would have the potential for broad-spectrum activity. Despite its potential there are only very few pan-viral drugs under clinical investigation, for instance inhibitor development for PI4K\u03b2 targeting various human enteroviruses [25] . One of the reasons could be that the overall success rate for inferring pan-viral hits seems to be low, since even for single viruses the identified host or restriction factors have shown to be highly variable between different studies (e.g. between [22] and [23] ). Interestingly, if hits found against one virus are tested against other viruses of the same group, it may well be observed that they are effective in the other viruses as well [23] , which speaks for the hypothesis that analyses on a pathway-level could be promising or even necessary approaches.",

First, we apply a maximum likelihood approach for joint analysis of viral host factors using a random effects model. Then, we propagate this information over a biological graph using network diffusion with Markov random walks in order to account for genes of importance on a pathway level, reduce the number of false negatives and possibly stabilize the ranking of host factors. With our approach it is possible to detect novel pan-pathogen host factors, while also considering prior information in the form of networks. Our model has been designed for heterogeneous data sets by accounting for various confounding factors within the data. When applying our method to six different RNAi screening data sets of the four positive sense ssRNA viruses, CHIKV, DENV, HCV and SARS-CoV, we found that the procedure is able to recover the host factors for single viruses that have been described in the literature before, and to predict novel pan-pathogen host factors. We validated the host factors for which compounds were commercially available experimentally using pharmacological inhibition screens for five virus, i.e., HCV, DENV, CHIKV, Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Coxsackie B virus (CVB). Moreover, we validated the newly predicted host factors, UBC, EP300 and PLCG1, using another siRNA knockdown on the Hepatitis C virus.",

They define a functional interaction as one in which two proteins are involved in the same biochemical reaction as an input, catalyst, activator, or inhibitor, or as two members of the same protein complex, i.e. functionally significant molecular events in cellular pathways and not mere protein-protein interactions which rarely show direct evidence of being involved in biochemical events. The network consists in part of expert-curated, high-quality functional edges and in part of edges that have been trained and validated with a naive Bayes classifier. Unlike many other biological networks, the high quality of the annotations does not necessitate choosing edges with care, such as edges derived from computational annotation or inference with older yeast-twohybrid technologies which are frequently false positives. Moreover, due to the biological interpretability of the edges in a pathway-context, a functional network like this should serve as a good choice to infer novel restriction and dependency factors and stabilize our rankings, because it associates genes connected with a disease and separates genes with mere physical interaction as in conventional pairwise networks. We stochastically normalized the weighted adjacency matrix of this network and then use the normalized matrix as transition matrix W.",

The mean of the geometric distribution E\u00bdl\ufffd \u00bc 1 r directly relates to the average length of the random walk. For instance, choosing a success probability of r = 0.5 would result in on average 2 trials until success. For a success probability of r = 0.2 the average number of trials is E\u00bdl\ufffd \u00bc 5, which yields an average path length of 5. Consequently, choosing a high success probability reduces the average number of edges travelled automatically and ranks the starting genes higher than genes farther away. We chose to use a restart probability of r = 35%, opting for on average approximately 3 travelled edges. Restart probabilities higher than 50% deprioritize the network information over the data, while lower restart probabilities than 20% give too much weight to the prior knowledge.",

To account for these effects, we use a combination of different normalization techniques for every screen separately (Supplement S1 Text for details). Briefly, the CHIVK and SARS-CoV screens use a pooled Dharmacon library on 96 well plates. We normalized the two data sets by first taking the natural logarithm over all samples, then substracting the mean background signal and finally computing a robust Z-score over the whole plate readout. The procedure has been applied separately for every plate. Since genes were not randomized on plates we did not use B-scoring or other methods that account for spatial effects [2, 29, 38] . For the HCV and DENV genome screens, we computed the natural logarithm for every readout of the complete data set, Bscored the plates using two-way median polish and, in a last step, calculated robust Z-scores. The HCV and DENV kinome screens have been normalized by first taking the natural logarithm of the well readouts and then fitting a local regression model to correct for cell counts. Since the HCV and DENV screens have randomized plate designs, we also corrected for spatial effects using two-way median polish using B-scores and eventually computed robust Z-scores (see Supplement S1 Code for the exact procedures).",

While the majority of genes has already been previously selected by the random effects model, we also discovered novel hits, such as UBC (rank 1), EP300 (rank 9), and PLCG1 (rank 13) using the network diffusion. Among the strongest effectors derived from the hierarchical model are, DYRK1B (rank 3), a nuclear-localized protein kinase participating in cell-cycle regulation, and PKN3 (rank 11), a rather little studied kinase that has been implicated in Rho GTPase regulation and PI3K-Akt signaling. UBC encodes ubiquitin, which is involved in numerous cellular processes, most prominently protein degradation. PLCG1 is crucially involved in signal transduction from receptor-mediated tyrosin kinases (e.g. Src) and catalyzes the formation of the second messenger IP3 and DAG. Recently PLCG1 was also found to impact progression of HCC [42] , the HCV replication cycle [43] , as well as receptor-mediated inflammation and innate immunity Host factor prioritization for pan-viral genetic perturbation screens [44] . EP300 is an acetyltransferase and acts as a transcriptional co-activator and has not been studied in detail so far. We compared the strongest gene effects \u03b3 g inferred by the hierarchical model (Supplement S5 Fig) to the virus-specific gene effects \u03c1 vg (for which RNAi screens have mostly been used; Fig 4) and found that for some of the estimates for the gene effects \u03b3 g the pathogen-specific effects are not consistent over all pathogens. For example, while perturbation of gene CDK5R2 has a beneficial impact on CHIKV replication, it has a restricting effect on the other three viruses. On the other hand perturbation of DYRK1B, PKN3, CDK6, or CSNK2B has either an all-negative or all-positive impact on the replication cycle of the ensemble of viruses. Genes that upon perturbation show the same consistent effect, i.e. suppression of early or late stages of the viral replication cycle, could be targets for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.",

We validated some of the top genes from Table 2 using pharmacological inhibitors to verify whether the predicted genes are indeed host factors that are involved in viral replication. In short, we searched the literature for inhibitors and conducted a screen for the proteins for which compounds were commercially available (see Supplement S4 Text for details on the experimental setup and Supplement S6 Fig for results) . In order to assess if the top inferred gene products really have a pan-viral effect, inhibitors were tested on DENV, CHIKV and HCV as before and two novel positive-strand ssRNA viruses, MERS-CoV and CVB. Of the top 20 host factors from Table 2 inhibitors were available for the dependency factors CAMKK2, CDK5R2, DGKE, DUSP1, DYRK1B, PIK4CA, PKN3 and PLK1. The inhibitors were tested in dose-response CPE reduction assays on cells infected with the viruses. In parallel we assessed cytotoxicity of the compounds and discarded measurements that led to a significant reduction in cell viability (below 75% of the signal obtained for untreated control cells). For every host factor, virus and compound concentration, we tested if inhibition of a protein reduced viral replication in comparison to a negative control significantly (one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon test). We adjusted all p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [45] . We found that inhibition of several host factors showed significant reductions in replication on subsets of the five viruses and specific compound concentrations. For instance, CDK5R2, PKN3 and DYRK1B were significant at the 10%-level after multiple testing correction for at least some compound concentrations in four of the five viruses. However, none of the tested compounds had a significant effect on the replication of all of the five viruses (Supplement S6 Fig) . Note that PLK1 was discarded due to cytotoxicity of the inhibitor at higher compound concentrations. For that reason, we point out that PLK1 should possibly also be discarded in the analysis of the primary screens.",

With a likelihood-based formulation jointly analyzing genetic perturbation screens of different viral RNAi screens is straightforward in comparison to a metaanalysis, since in the latter case every virus is analyzed independently and results have to be aggregated, thereby potentially discarding common host factors.

Of the top 20 host factors (Table 2) , we were able to find commercially available compounds for nine of them, which we then biologically validated. While the screen confirmed the importance of these genes on the pan-viral replication cycle of subsets of viruses, no host factor could be found that is significant for all viruses. In general, viruses usurp defined cellular pathways. Even closely related viruses may use different entry points to the pathway. One example are the Dengue and Zika viruses which both depend on the host factor STT3A, but only DENV requires STT3B for replication [22] . The degree of similarity of the molecular biology of the viruses seems to determine the success of finding pan-viral genes in contrast to finding relevant pathways. While it makes theoretical sense that all positive-sense ssRNA viruses use the same host factors, detection of these has proven to be complicated and, as already mentioned in the introduction, yields variable results even for the same virus. A lack of overlap between screens, flexibility of the cell in several aspects and the possibility of viruses to just take different routes to achieve replication corroborates this hypothesis and makes pathway-analyses even more important. The broader the targeted group of viruses, the more central a target gene would have to be (e.g. UBC), but in that case it gets increasingly unlikely to find a inhibitor condition that only harms the virus but not the host cell. For bacteria, antibiotics are only specific to a more or less related group of bacteria (e.g. gram-positives), because of the metabolic similarity of the group. For viruses, it is likely that these groups need to be much narrower because in many cases only closely related viruses might actually share enough similarity in the metabolic or regulators pathways they exploit. Additionally, it has to be emphasized though that a protein inhibition screen like the one we conducted is not perfectly able to validate the inferred genes and their function in the replication cycle of the viruses. Thus a more rigorous validation could shed light on the biological importance of these genes.",

Generally, host dependencies and restriction factors are not necessarily crucial for host cells survival, i.e. host factors can be knocked down without inducing cell death. Exceptions are single candidates such as UBC which is central player in cell biology. Ubiquitination of proteins can target them for degradation in the proteasome which is an important homeostatic process in every cell. The proteasome has come up frequently as host factor for many viruses, albeit not always the same genes [46] . Inhibition of the proteasome, while being vital for the cell, is already done therapeutically, for instance in cancer treatment [47] , or in studies for antiviral treatment [48] . Consequently, the inhibition of host factors that are also crucial for the host cell can be achieved even though it is a matter of fine balancing between cytotoxicity to the cell and efficiacy against disease.",
