Thus, this is a point at which systemic infection spread might be restricted. Subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSM) captured murine CMV (MCMV) from the afferent lymph and poorly supported its replication. Blocking the type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) increased MCMV infection of SSM and of the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) lining the subcapsular sinus, and accelerated viral spread to the spleen. Little splenic virus derived from SSM, arguing that they mainly induce an anti-viral state in the otherwise susceptible FRC. NK cells also limited infection, killing infected FRC and causing tissue damage. They acted independently of IFN-I, as IFNAR blockade increased NK cell recruitment, and NK cell depletion increased infection in IFNAR-blocked mice. Thus SSM restricted MCMV infection primarily though IFN-I, with NK cells providing a second line of defence. The capacity of innate immunity to restrict MCMV escape from the subcapsular sinus suggested that enhancing its recruitment might improve infection control.",

Our knowledge of human CMV is largely limited to chronic infection, which is hard to treat. Vaccination must target early infection. Related animal viruses therefore provide a vital source of information. Lymph nodes are a bottleneck in murine CMV spread from local to systemic infection. We show that viral passage through lymph nodes is restricted by interferons and NK cells. These defences alone cannot contain infection, but boosting their recruitment by vaccination has the potential to keep infection locally contained.",

Although adaptive immunity normally prevents disease, adaptive immune priming has not prevented infection establishment [2] , suggesting that this presents a qualitatively distinct challenge, requiring possibly different immune effectors. Analysing early human infection is made difficult by CMV transmission being sporadic and largely asymptomatic. However CMV infections long pre-date human speciation [3] , so different host / virus pairs are likely to share common themes and analogous animal infections can yield key insights. MCMV has particular value for understanding how CMVs work in vivo, as its host provides the standard model of mammalian cell biology. MCMV exploits myeloid cells to spread [4, 5] , and live imaging shows peripheral to systemic spread via lymph nodes (LN) [6] , so LN myeloid cells are likely to be a key target for limiting systemic infection.",

            "text": "Host immunity and viral evasion both influence CMV infection outcomes. Which dominates a given context can be hard to predict. Although MCMV has evolved to infect myeloid cells, myeloid phenotypes are diverse [7] and not all support its spread. SSM police the recycling of extracellular fluid from peripheral tissues back to the blood, capturing viruses from the lymph when it enters the LN subcapsular sinus [8, 9] . Viral replication in SSM potentially delivers an amplified load. Therefore this must be curtailed, or at least slowed sufficiently for other defences to come into play. In addition SSM must protect the FRC that line the subcapsular sinus, and are targeted for example by Ebola virus [10] . While pathogen absorption by SSM can protect down-stream targets such as the blood, it is unlikely to prevent FRC infection as they present a large surface area in the same site [11] . Thus the SSM barrier must be active as well as adsorptive.-In this context SSM would capture viruses to sample rather than cleanse the lymph, and would communicate danger signals, for example to NK cells [12, 13] . The subcapsular sinus is a prominent site of type I interferon (IFN-I) transcription [14] and IFN-I stimulates NK cells [15] , so it could contribute. SSM also communicate directly with B cells [16] . T cell-dependent antibody responses take several days to become effective, but T cellindependent antibody responses might protect SSM and FRC in some settings.",

IFN-I may contribute as it has anti-MCMV [23] and anti-MuHV-4 activity [24] , despite viral evasion. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) MCMV inoculation, IFN-I signals to NK cells and DC [25] . I.p.

This result suggested that NK cells caused the PLN damage. Infected PLN of IFNAR-blocked mice showed extensive expression of the apoptotic cell marker caspase 3 (Fig 7a) , which was negligible in uninfected PLN (Fig  7b) . Most viral GFP + FRC were caspase 3 + ; when NK cells were depleted, most were caspase 3 - (Fig 7a and 7c ). Therefore NK cell recruitment into the PLN led to apoptosis in infected FRC. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. \u03b1IFNAR reduced B220 and DAPI staining, and disorganized ER-TR7 staining, implying loss of LN cellularity and structure. (b). C57BL/6 mice were given \u03b1IFNAR, depleted of NK1.1 + cells with mAb PK136 (\u03b1NK), given both treatments, or given neither (control). All were then given i.f. MCMV-GR (10 6 p.f.u.). 1 day later PLN were stained for viral GFP and NKp46 + NK cells. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Closed arrows show example NKp46 + cells. Open arrows show example GFP + infected cells. Like IFNAR blockade (Fig 1) , SSM depletion accelerates MCMV spread from the PLN to the spleen [6] . Thus we hypothesized that IFN-I production by SSMs restricted PLN infection. To compare SSM depletion with IFNAR blockade, we depleted SSM with i.f. liposomal clodronate, blocked IFNAR, gave both treatments, or gave neither, then infected all the mice i.f. with MCMV (Fig 8) .",

However this increased FRC infection recruited relatively few NK cells (Fig 8d) . Thus, although NK cells controlled FRC infection, their recruitment did not depend on FRC infection. IFN-I signalling was not essential to recruit NK cells either (Fig 8d) . In fact it limited NK cell recruitment and preserved PLN cellularity, presumably by reducing virus loads (Fig 8c and 8d) . NK cell recruitment was maximal after SSM depletion plus IFNAR blockade. Thus, non-SSM myeloid cells such as medullary sinus and medullary cord macrophages and DC [38] , which are not depleted by i.f. liposomal clodronate [22] , may also produce the necessary cytokines, and the multiplicity of sufficient signals meant that NK recruitment correlated primarily with total virus load. This recruitment was then associated with a reduction in ER-TR7 + cell infection and a general loss of LN cellularity.",

The gL coding sequence was disrupted by a \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2gal) expression cassette, allowing infected cells to be identified by staining for \u03b2gal. Both control and IFNAR-blocked mice had \u03b2gal + cells around the subcapsular sinus (Fig 11a) . The latter had significantly more per field of view (Fig 11b) . Most \u03b2gal + cells were SSM. However both control and IFNAR-blocked mice also had \u03b2gal + ER-TR7 + FRC. A significantly higher proportion of \u03b2gal + cells were ER-TR7 + after IFNAR blockade (Fig 11c) . Therefore i.f. MCMV directly infected both SSM and FRC; and IFN-I suppressed FRC infection more than SSM infection. This result, and increased FRC infection after SSM depletion (Fig 8) , argued that FRC infection is normally suppressed by IFN-I from MCMV-exposed SSM.",

Thus, the need to contain this infection preceded adaptive immunity. Containment depended primarily on IFN-I, which restricted SSM and FRC infections despite viral IFN-I evasion [42] . Innate immunity is inherently polylithic, and IFN-I was not the sole SSM-based defence: NK cell recruitment was also important.

            "text": "The greater effects on MCMV of IFNAR blockade than pDC depletion, and of IFNAR blockade plus SSM depletion than SSM depletion alone, implied redundancy in IFN-I production between SSM and pDC. Medullary sinus and medullary cord macrophages [38] and conventional dendritic cells may also contribute, as may resident stromal cells and recruited inflammatory cells. Most pDC are migratory and recruited to inflammatory sites [29] . Thus their response can take time to develop. The early (day 1) inhibition of MCMV infection by IFN-I, including inhibition of viral reporter gene expression in the first cells encountered, was consistent with a key role for resident SSM. SSM depletion possibly under-estimated their contribution, as the ensuing inflammation could recruit other, compensatory IFN-I-producing cells. We envisage that SSM are constitutively in a high state of readiness to mount IFN-I responses to captured virions, whereas immigrant cells function more as a back-up should SSM prove insufficient. NK cell recruitment was another important back-up to the SSM IFN-I response. Whole organ titers have established the importance of NK cells for MCMV control [15, 31, 36] and the impact of viral evasion [46] . What infected cell types NK cells target has been less clear. Although lymph-borne virions infected large numbers of SSM, the SSM contribution to new virion production was relatively low. FRC seemed to be the main source. A similar situation occurs in the lungs, where alveolar macrophages are prominent infection targets but most new virus seems to come from type II alveolar epithelial cells [47] . Consequently FRC were an important NK cell target. When IFNAR was blocked, increased FRC infection and NK cell recruitment led to tissue damage. This destructive capacity of NK cells could explain why inflammation around the subcapsular sinus compromises subsequent immune responses [48] . Fig 12 summarizes what we now know of MCMV infection and control at the LN subcapsular sinus.",

            "text": "Protection against VSV depends on blocking acute neuronal infection; protection against MCMV depends on reducing its spread to sites of persistence, such as the bone marrow and salivary glands. Thus a key question now is whether recruiting innate effectors more rapidly and in amplified form can reduce long-term systemic CMV loads. IFN-I alone is unlikely to protect against chronic infection. However a capacity to amplify and recruit innate responses at the LN subcapsular sinus, for example through CD4 + T cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 [49] , may be an important property of vaccine-induced immunity. Type I IFN and NK Cells Limit MCMV Escape from Lymph Node Subcapsular Sinus cell-specific IFNAR disruption, LysM-cre mice were back-crossed onto IFNAR flox/flox . Virus was injected i.f. (10 6 p.f.u. in 50\u03bcl) under isoflurane anesthesia. For luciferase imaging, mice were given 2mg luciferin i.p. and monitored for light emission by charge-coupled device camera scanning (Xenogen, IVIS-200). Phagocytic cells were depleted with 50\u03bcl i.f. clodronateloaded liposomes (http://clodronateliposomes.org) [39] 1 and 3 days before infection. Depletion was confirmed in uninfected mice by a loss of CD169 expression around the PLN subcapsular sinus [6, 22] . NK cells were depleted from C57BL/6 mice with anti-NK1.1 mAb PK136 (200\u03bcg i.p., Bio-X-cell) and from BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice with anti-asialo-GM1 pAb (100\u03bcl i. p., Wako Chemicals). Each was given 1 and 3 days before infection and every 2 days thereafter. Cell depletion was >90% effective, as measured by immunostaining of tissue sections with anti-NKp46 antibody. IFN-I signalling was blocked with anti-IFNAR mAb MAR1-5A3 (200\u03bcg i.p., Bio-X-cell), given 1 day before infection and every 2 days thereafter. pDC were depleted with anti-Bst2 mAb BX444 (250\u03bcg i.p., Bio-X-Cell), 1 and 3 days before infection and every 2 days thereafter. Cell depletion was 85-90% effective, as measured by flow cytometry for Bst-2 and SiglecH.

For live imaging we used a derivative (MCMV-LUC) that expresses firefly luciferase via autocatalytic release from a fusion protein with the lytic cycle M78 gene product [54] . For floxed reporter gene switching we used MCMV-GR, which has an HCMV IE1 promoter-driven cassette inserted into M157 [6] . The cassette encodes a floxed GFP gene upstream of a nuclear-targeted tdTomato gene. Thus, cre irreversibly switches MCMV-GR from green to nuclear red fluorescence. Switched and unswitched MCMV-GR show no difference in host colonization. MCMV with the essential virion glycoprotein L (gL) gene disrupted by insertion of an HCMV IE1 promoter-driven \u03b2galactosidase expression cassette into M115 [6] was propagated on gL-expressing NIH-3T3 cells. All other viruses were propagated on NIH-3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1658). Infected cells were cleared of cell debris by low speed centrifugation (500 x g, 10min), then virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (35, 000 x g, 2h) .

For myeloidFig 12. Schematic representation of MCMV escape from the LN subcapsular sinus. Most virions in the afferent lymph are captured by SSM, but some infect FRC. In the absence of IFN-I (a), FRC infection is highly productive, SSM infection rather less so. Virions are released into the LN to infect new FRC and myeloid cells, and also back into the lymph flow, whence they can reach the blood. To counter this (b), IFN-I from SSM capturing virions inhibits infection in both SSM and FRC. pDC also produce IFN-I. They may receive infected cell debris and cytokines via the FRC conduits. Inflammatory mediators also recruit NK cells to kill infected FRC. Thus MCMV propagation is largely suppressed. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1006069.g012",
