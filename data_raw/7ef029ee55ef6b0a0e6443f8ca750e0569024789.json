Results: RV1A-GFP showed a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells but failed to express GFP or Renilla luciferase due to deletion. The smaller fluorescent protein construct, RV1A-iLOV, was stably expressed in infected cells. RV1A-iLOV expression was used to examine the antiviral effect of bafilomycin in HeLa cells. Compared to parental virus, RV1A-iLOV infection of BALB/c mice yielded a similar viral load and level of cytokine mRNA expression. However, imaging of fixed lung tissue failed to reveal a fluorescent signal, likely due to the oxidation and bleaching of iLOV-bound flavin mononucleotide. We therefore employed an anti-iLOV antibody for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence imaging. The iLOV signal was identified in airway epithelial cells and CD45+ CD11b+ lung macrophages.",

We therefore employed an anti-iLOV antibody for immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence F I G U R E 2 Construction of the infectious recombinant rhinovirus-iLOV. A, Plaque morphology of HeLa cells infected with parental wild-type RV1A or RV1A-iLOV. iLOV (green) expression was directly detected by blue laser for RV plaques.

Viral copy number was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Viral titer was determined by TCID 50 (n = 3, mean \u00b1 SD). C, Fluorescence imaging for RV-iLOV. HeLa cells were infected with parental wild-type RV1A or RV1A-iLOV for 24 h at an MOI of 0.1.

The RV1A-iLOV infectious cDNA clone was used as a template for amplification of complete iLOV sequence imaging. We infected mice with RV1A-iLOV and harvested lungs one day postinfection. We have previously shown that, besides airway epithelial cells, RV colocalizes with CD68+ macrophages. 13, 14 Immunohistochemical staining with anti-iLOV showed signal in both the epithelium and macrophages ( Figure 6A ).

            "text": "In the present study, we sought to design and generate a recombi- Construction of recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent markers, especially GFP, has been applied through reverse genetics to RNA viruses including influenza virus, 34 Zika virus, 35 West Nile virus, 36 respiratory syncytial virus, 37 murine coronavirus, 38 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. 39 However, insertion of large fluorescent protein coding sequences into the genome of the picornaviruses, a group of small RNA viruses whose genome sizes range from 7.2 to 8.5 kb, has been problematic. Insertion of the GFP ORF into poliovirus severely impaired viral replication and was deleted in the course of cell culture serial passage. 40 In addition, an attempt to construct a recombinant foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) expressing GFP or Renilla luciferase protein failed, likely due to the limited packaging capability. 41 Subsequent construction of viruses containing increasingly larger inserts suggested 300-400 nt F I G U R E 6 Presence of iLOV signal in the airway epithelium and lung macrophages of RV1A-iLOV-infected mice. A,Twenty-four hours after infection, lungs were fixed in formaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-iLOV or isotype control IgG (bar, 50 \u03bcm). B, Lung sections were costained with AF-488-conjugated anti-iLOV (green), AF-555conjugated anti-VP2/0 (red), and Cy5-conjugated CD68 (far red optical spectrum, shown in blue). C, Lung CD45 + , CD11b+, iLOV+ cells from RV-infected BALB/c mice were identified one day postinfection and analyzed as a percentage of CD45 + cells (n = 4 from one experiment). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (*different from sham, P < 0.05; one-way ANOVA) as the maximum size to be inserted into FMDV genome. Consistent with this, RV1A has been used to express a 393-nt-long fragment of HIV gag gene. 24 Shorter antigenic tags have also been inserted into the nonstructural proteins of poliovirus. 42 Compared to GFP, fluorescent proteins based on flavin-binding LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage sensing) domain offer advantages owing to their smaller size (354 nt), pH, and thermal stability. 43 Similar to viral proteins, iLOV protein is released from the RV polyprotein through viral proteinase-mediated auto-cleavage during viral protein production, an early step of viral replication. Detection of iLOV in mouse tissue is therefore highly suggestive of viral replication, particularly in the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear whether iLOV signal in macrophages represents replication or engulfment of the virus by phagocytosis. Viral replication in cultured macrophages is limited, 45 though it has recently been shown that airway epithelial cells promote rhinovirus replication in monocytic cells. 46 Because there are more than 100 different RV serotypes (in species A and B alone), it is infeasible to develop a cross-reactive antibody for RV. Until now, only one antibody has been available for this purpose, the monoclonal antibody R16-7. This antibody binds to the VP2 capsid protein of the closely related RV-A16 and RV-A1 strains 6 but not to RV-A2, RV-B14, or RV-A49. 15 We developed a recombinant virus with a fluorescent marker that could be used for tracking of RV infection in vivo. We designed the iLOV sequence to be flanked with 2A pro cleavage sites and then inserted between the RV genomic sequences encoding the VP1 and 2A proteins. 2A pro mediates auto-cleavage between VP1 and 2A proteins. 20, 47 Since self-catalytic cleavage is a characteristic of picornavirus replication, this design should allow extension of our technique to all human RVs. Given the fact that iLOV sequence was stably maintained within RV1A genome during consecutive passages, it is plausible that other RVs serotypes would accommodate and maintain the stability of iLOV sequence. Though the 2A pro cleavage sites of numerous RV serotypes are heterogeneous, 48 designing the flanked 2A pro cleavage sequence to be serotype-specific would guarantee the release of iLOV. Besides VP1-2A cleavage site, the junction site between 5\u2032UTR and the N-terminus of VP4 has been used to insert GFP in the genome of coxsackie A16 virus 49 ; however, the insertion impaired viral replication. Taken together, these data suggest that the construction strategy for RV1A-iLOV could be applied to other RV serotypes for studying the life cycle of RV in cultured cells, screening for antiviral drugs and for the pathogenesis of RV.",

On the other hand, the smaller fluorescent protein construct, iLOV, was stably expressed in RV1A-iLOV-infected cells both in vitro and in vivo. Evaluation of iLOV expression was used to assess the antiviral effects of bafilomycin in RV1A-iLOV-infected cells in vitro.

Accordingly, iLOV has been used as a reporter gene in recombinant FMDV 41 and reovirus. 44 However, in the latter studies, iLOV expression was only examined in cultured mammalian cells, not in vivo experiments. We now show that iLOV is expressed in RV1A-iLOVinfected cells in vivo. Though some deletion occurs during in vivo infection, over 90% of the recombinant RV1A-iLOV retains the iLOV sequence. However, while iLOV was readily detectable in cultured HeLa cells, the iLOV fluorescence was rapidly lost in fixed cells and lung tissue, likely due to the oxidation and bleaching of iLOV-bound flavin mononucleotide. We therefore required the use of anti-iLOV antibody to detect RV1A-iLOV.",
