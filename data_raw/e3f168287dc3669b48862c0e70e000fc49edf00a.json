            "text": "Pneumonitis is the leading cause of death associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.",

            "text": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given as standard therapy to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who carry activating mutations in the EGFR gene. The EGFR-TKI gefitinib, when administered to NSCLC patients carrying activating EGFR mutations (e.g., 15-bp deletion in exon 19, L858R in exon 21), significantly improved response and survival [1, 2] . Furthermore, these EGFR mutations were predominantly found in patients of East-Asian origin [3] . However, although EGFR-TKI treatment has significant effects on response and prognosis, a study has reported that 40% of patients treated with EGFR-TKI experience severe adverse events, and treatment had to be discontinued in 7.7% of the patients because of unmanageable severe adverse events [4] . Diarrhea and rashes were the most frequent adverse effects but were Table 1 . Cytokine mRNA expression profile of wildtype (WT) vs surfactant protein C-tumor necrosis factor transgenic (SPC-TNF tg) mouse lung tissue. Lung mRNA transcripts of WT and SPC-TNF tg mice were quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. The data are represented relative to control values, as means \u00b1 SEM (n = 8). Significant values are indicated in boldface. Gefitinib (100 or 200 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily in wild type (WT; C57BL/6) or SPC-TNF tg mice for 14 days. In wild type (WT) mice, no significant pathological change was observed ( Figure 1a ). In SPC-TNF tg mice, administration of gefitinib resulted in severe lymphocytic infiltration in the alveolar septa, and the mice also developed thicker alveolar septa than non-administered mice (Figure 1b) . After 14 days of administration, there was also no death related to gefitinib administration. Moreover, there was no change in body weight in either WT or SPC-TNF tg mice (Figure 1c) . To determine the inflammatory cytokines that mediate lymphocytic infiltration in SPC-TNF tg mice, real-time RT PCR was performed (Tables 2 and 3 ). In wt mice, although mRNA levels for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were significantly increased, no inflammation and lung injury was observed, suggesting a maintenance of balance by other anti-inflammatory cytokines, or through an unknown mechanisms. The mRNA level of IL-17\u03b1 was found to be significantly increased by gefitinib administration. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with EGFR-TKI might cause lung inflammation in SPC-TNF tg mice that overexpress TNF in the lung. Gefitinib enhances lymphocyte infiltration and causes lung tissue inflammation. Lung tissue sections of (a) wild type (WT) mice and (b) surfactant protein C-tumor necrosis factor (SPC-TNF) transgenic (tg) mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The images were obtained at a magnification of 40\u00d7 and 200\u00d7, in the upper and lower rows, respectively. (c) Body weight changes are shown for WT and SPC-TNF Tg mice over 14 days of daily oral treatment with 1% tween 80 as control or with gefitinb (100 or 200 mg/kg). The WT; C57BL/6 or SPC-TNF tg mice used in these studies were 6-8 weeks old. The scale bars represent 500 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm for 40\u00d7 and 200\u00d7 magnification, respectively.

These SLX-Lipo-ICG could accumulate in the regions of inflammation or tumor owing to the interaction of SLX and E-selectin, which enhanced E-selectin expression by inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, in vascular endothelial cells [22] . In WT and SPC-TNF tg mice, we measured whole-lung fluorescence ex vivo using the Clairvivo OPT fluorescence imaging system. We observed slight accumulation of ICG-loaded liposomes in whole lungs of SPC-TNF tg mice that were not treated with gefitinib compared with whole lungs of WT mice. Furthermore, after 14 days of gefitinib administration, accumulation of liposomes was enhanced in whole-lung samples taken from SPC-TNF tg mice. However, there was no enhancement in liposome accumulation after gefitinib treatment in WT mice (Figure 2a,b) .

In BEAS-2B cells, the TACE inhibitor TAPI-1 suppressed TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, but not EGF-stimulation (Figure 5a ). Furthermore, TAPI-1 enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis significantly (Figure 5b and c) , suggesting that TACE mediates EGFR phosphorylation, leading to cell survival upon TNF exposure. The major downstream signals from EGFR include the PI-3K/AKT and RAS/ERK pathways. TNF transactivated EGFR by shedding mainly two EGFR ligands, and then we determined the signaling molecules downstream of EGFR that regulate cell survival in the presence of TNF. We used wortmannin and U0126 to inhibit AKT and ERK1/2, respectively. Wortmannin or U0126 alone did not induce apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells. Wortmannin significantly enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis, while U0126 did not affect TNF-induced apoptosis (Figure 5d,e) . Therefore, the PI3K/AKT pathway may contribute to cell survival via TNF-induced EGFR transactivation. Although it would be difficult to recapitulate the SPC-TNF tg mouse model using BEAS-2B cells, we speculate that P38MAPK signal contributes to TNF-induced apoptosis [25] .",

To verify the involvement of EGFR ligands in TNF-induced EGFR transactivation, we used neutralizing antibodies for EGFR. Therefore, TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by cetuximab, indicating that EGFR ligands contributed to EGFR transactivation by TNF (Figure 6a ). To identify the EGFR ligands involved in TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, neutralizing antibodies were employed. As shown in Figure 6b , EGFR-transactivation by TNF was attenuated by the treatment of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1. Furthermore, the combination of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 exhibited remarkable inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of TNF (Figure 6c ). To measure the expression of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant, ELISA was performed. HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 expression in the culture supernatant increased upon TNF exposure; however, the presence of TAPI-1 reduced the expression of these EGFR-ligands (Figure 6d,e) . Moreover, knockdown of TACE using siRNA (Figure 6f) , reduced the amount of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant (Figure 6g,h) . These results indicate that the expression of HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant was regulated by TACE and that these ligands were involved in TNF-induced transactivation in BEAS-2B cells. Taken together, lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B should be protected from TNF-induced apoptosis through EGFR transactivation via the autocrine loop of the EGFR ligands, HB-EGF and TGF-\u03b1, which are cleaved by TACE.

Airway inflammation, characterized by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, induces excessive EGFR signaling [27, 28] . High amounts of EGFR ligands, amphiregulin and TGF-\u03b1 secreted by bronchial epithelial cells result in the activation of EGFR in an autocrine loop, leading to increased mucus production by goblet cells [29, 30] . Therefore, inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity may be beneficial to the treatment of hypersecretory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchiectasis. Conversely, EGFR-ligands EGF or TGF-\u03b1 can regulate lung epithelial cell repair in vitro and in vivo [31, 32] . EGFR is overexpressed and activated in response to lung epithelial injury and play an important role in lung epithelial repair [33] . Increased amounts of both TGF-\u03b1 and EGFR have been observed in bleomycin-injured lungs [34] . In addition, TGF-\u03b1 has been identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with acute lung injury [34, 35] . Taken together, the expression of EGFR or EGFR-ligands, and EGFR tyrosine kinase activity protect lung epithelial cells from apoptosis and enhance their recovery from lung inflammation and injury [36] . However, further studies are required to discover the role of EGFR and its ligands in inflammatory lung diseases. In this study, EGFR tyrosine kinase was transactivated by TNF in SPC-TNF tg mice. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase by gefitinib increased TNF-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells and significantly enhanced lung injury. The results of this study are consistent with those of previous reports, which showed that activation of EGFR and other ErbB family members protects colon epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis [20, 37] .",

In regions of inflammation in arthritis and tumors, vascular endothelial cells are activated by inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b1 and TNF. Leukocytes roll on the vascular endothelial cells by binding E-selectin on the vascular endothelial cell surface. Leukocytes infiltrate the vascular endothelium, and then migrate and accumulate in the inflammatory region. The sugar chain sialyl Lewis X (SLX) is well characterized as an E-selectin ligand, expressed on the surface of leukocytes. Therefore, SLX-liposomes primarily targeting E-selectin in activated endothelial cells deliver and accumulate their ICG content in regions of inflammation and within tumors [38, 39] . Therefore, we employed an SLX-Lipo-ICG to evaluate lung tissue inflammation after administration of gefitinib in WT and SPC-TNF tg mice. The basal accumulation of SLX-Lipo-ICG in SPC-TNF tg mice was higher than in WT mice. Furthermore, after gefitinib administration, the accumulation of SLX-Lipo-ICG was enhanced in SPC-TNF tg mice but not in WT mice. These results indicate that gefitinib remarkably enhances TNF-induced lung inflammation in SPC-TNF tg mice.",

            "text": "In summary, we were able to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to EGFR-TKI-induced lung injury using SPC-TNF tg mice. EGFR activation prevents TNF-induced apoptosis and severe inflammation. IL-17A was the most upregulated cytokine and may be involved. Furthermore, in lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B, we found that TNF activates EGFR phosphorylation by stimulating TGF-\u03b1 and HB-EGF via TACE activity. This EGFR transactivation by TNF regulates cell survival. Taken together, our findings provide the biological mechanisms underlying EGFR-TKI-induced lung injury. Therefore, our findings suggest that caution will have to be taken prior to administration of EGFR-TKI in NSCLC cases that are associated with high levels of TNF or inflammation. This study has potential limitations. The effects reported are based on SPC-TNF tg mice, which highly express TNF in whole lung. We cannot, however, exclude the effect of other cytokines and signal transductions associated with lung fibrosis; these would be addressed in future research.",
