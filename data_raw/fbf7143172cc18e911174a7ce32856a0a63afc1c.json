It was questioned if this is a safe vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the safety of an inactivated monovalent H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine Methods: We focused on the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix \u00ae and applied a self reporting questionnaire in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) and medical students at a major university hospital. Results: In total, 4337 individuals were vaccinated, consisting of 3808 HCWs and 529 medical students. The vaccination rate of the employees was higher than 40%. The majority of individuals were vaccinated in November 2009. In total, 291 of the 4337 vaccinations were reported to lead to one or more adverse reactions (6.7%). Local reactions were reported in 3.8%, myalgia and arthralgia in 3.7%, fatigue in 3.7%, headache in 3.1%. Conclusions: Our data together with available data from several national and international institutions points to a safe pandemic influenza vaccine.",

By contrast, the matrix protein (M) and neuraminidase (NA) genes are found in European swine flu isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus shows that six genome segments stem from a triple-reassortant virus circulating in North American swine, seeded from human, avian and classical swine lineages.",

One month later, on June 11, 2009, the WHO officially declared a H1N1 pandemic [11] . This was the first pandemic since the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic. The WHO alert level was lifted to phase 6. The safety of influenza vaccine is in the focus of research since many years [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Due to a special debate on the safety of the pandemic influenza vaccines [18] , it was the objective of the present study to analyse the safety using a self reporting questionnaire approach in the acute event of a pandemic and a novel vaccine which was debated for its safety by the general population and healthcare worders (HCWs). We chose a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) and medical students after vaccination with Pandemrix \u00ae since according to German federal recommendations HCWs had a top priority for vaccination [19] .",

Therefore, we analysed self reporting questionnaires concerning adverse reactions in 4337 HCWs and medical students. Of course, this study -that was initiated in the acute event of a pandemic and a safety discussion -has a variety of limitations. Apart from the paucity of demographic data, self reporting questionnaires are largely limited since there may be a number of individuals who do not return the questionnaire despite adverse reaction manifestation. However, there was a need to assess potential adverse reactions since the general population and the HCWs asked for data about the new vaccine. Therefore, we decided to undertake a self reporting study despite that fact that the extent of underreporting of side effects can not be examined precisely in the chosen design. It is noteworthy that with our self reporting system we found a rate of 6.7% (291 of 4337 vaccinations). This frequency differs slightly from data from other studies but points to a safe vaccine in terms of acute adverse reactions. A prospective, randomised study with 178 participants by Vajo et al. concluded that all adverse events were rare, mild, and transient. Using the vaccine Fluval P, the most frequent reactions in this study were pain at injection site (eight cases) and fatigue for 1-2 days after vaccination (three cases) [22] . Concerning the vaccination rate we can report a rate of 4337 of about 10 000 employees of the hospital. This is a vaccination rate of over 40%. In a parallel study in Frankfurt/Main, the influenza vaccination rates of the HCWs of the University Hospital Frankfurt were measured. In this study, we were also able to show that the 2009 vaccination rate (seasonal influenza [40.5%], swine flu [36.3%]) was better than the average annual uptake of influenza vaccine in the German health care system (approximately 22% for seasonal and 15% for swine flu) [23] .",
