Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information.",

Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets.",

These methods trade off run-time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict. For example, the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [33] , whose running time is (n 6 ) on inputs of length n, is not practical for RNA sequences of length more than 100 nucleotides. This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure, they usually run faster than the MFE-based methods that handle the same class of structures.

Roughly, the larger the SHAPE reactivity value for a given nucleotide, the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure. However, limited SHAPE reactivity data is available, and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or, if it is paired, to what other nucleotide. Deigan et al. [46] created pseudo energy terms from SHAPE reactivity data, as a means of integrating such data into prediction software. They reported prediction accuracy of 96% to 100% for three moderate-sized RNAs (< 200 nucleotides) and for 16S rRNA ( 1500 nucleotides). ShapeKnots [47] is a new method for incorporating SHAPE reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al.

This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot-free structure; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure's free energy [49] . Given a pseudoknot-free structure as input, HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and, relative to that constraint, has minimum free energy. HFold's running time is O(n 3 ), significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures. Several experts have provided evidence for, and support, the hierarchical folding hypothesis [49] [50] [51] [52] . The class of structures that HFold can handle, density-2 structures, is quite general and includes many important pseudoknots including Htype pseudoknots, kissing hairpins and infinite chains of interleaved bands, with arbitrary nested (pseudoknotted) substructures. (Roughly, a structure is density-2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping pseudoknotted stems.) Another advantage of HFold over heuristic methods such as HotKnots or ShapeKnots is that unlike these methods, HFold minimizes the free energy of the possibly pseudoknotted output structure relative to the given input structure. Therefore HFold's method of adding pseudoknotted stems is better motivated energetically than that of HotKnots or ShapeKnots.",

Second, if the first structure http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 input to HFold contains base pairs that are not in the true pseudoknot-free structure for the given RNA sequence or is not the complete pseudoknot-free structure (i.e., it does not include all the base pairs in the pseudoknot-free structure), HFold is often unable to predict the known pseudoknotted structure as output.",

Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information, or constraints, that can guide prediction. In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user-defined constraints, it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method's accuracy persists as the input information degrades. We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method. (We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise.) To the best of our knowledge, the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before.",

Our method, Iterative HFold, takes a pseudoknot-free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy, among all structures produced by these methods. While one of its underlying methods, HFold, strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis, the other three use iterations to extend or remove the base pairs of input structure, with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold. Thus, unlike HFold, iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure (while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same). This is valuable since 1) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle, there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some base pairs in the initially formed pseudoknot-free secondary structure can improve prediction [53, 54] .",

HFold-PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true pseudoknot-free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a pseudoknot since, if the input structure only has the specific stem in question, the output structure of HFold-PKonly will determine if the given stem can be part of a pseudoknot.",

In contrast, one of the best heuristic methods, HotKnots V2.0, takes 1.7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides. Therefore our method is practical for prediction of long RNA structures. Iterative HFold bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot, ((72.83%, 83.37%) vs. (54.56%, 66.25%)) and is comparable to that of HotKnots V2.0, (vs. (73.60%, 83.35%)) two of the best prediction methods available. Iterative HFold's accuracy is significantly higher than that of IPknot and HotKnots on our IP-pk168 data set. Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is provided, so it is more robust than HFold. Specifically, Iterative HFold's average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure, and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided.",

For each vector f of F-measures (where, for example, f may be the F-measures of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted structures) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement, where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f (|f |), and then calculate their average F-measures. These 10 4 calculated average F-measures represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f . We then report the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of this distribution (i.e., the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average F-measures calculated above) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively, and call it the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval. By reporting the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of a method, A, on a data set, D, we say that we are 95% confident that the average F-measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval.

This can be useful when the given input structure is not a high-accuracy estimate of G big , the true pseudoknot-free substructure of the reference structure. Second, while HFold and HFold-PKonly can add base pairs that cross those in G, they cannot add base pairs that cross each other, and neither can SimFold. In contrast, Iterative HFold can add base pairs that cross each other. This is particularly useful when the input structure contains limited information about G big , and so it is necessary both to predict base pairs in G big and in G small in order to get a good prediction.",

Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90% of G big is available, after which HFold is more accurate. Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about G big is known because it can add both pseudoknot-free and pseudoknotted base pairs. In particular, using methods 3 and 4 (see Section 'Iterative HFold') Iterative HFold first finds a low energy pseudoknot-free structure that includes the given input structure (by extending the stems of the given structure), and then adds pseudoknotted base pairs to further lower the energy of the overall structure. However, when the vast majority of base pairs of G big are provided as input, HFold dominates as it keeps the base pairs of the input structure, thereby often adding base pairs of G small . When 100% of G big is provided as input, HFold's bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval is (85.74%, 91.87%), compared with (79.36%, 87.41%) for Iterative HFold.",

If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold's average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A , we can see that HFold's slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold, making Iterative HFold more robust than HFold.

One way to produce an input structure is to use an MFE pseudoknot-free structure prediction method, such as MFold. We chose SimFold as it is an implementation of MFold and, because of its energy parameters, gives more accurate predictions than MFold. Of course, when comparative information is available, the user can input such information as structural constraint as a pseudoknot-free structure to Iterative HFold and expect a better prediction result.

We chose IPknot because it was the best-performing noncomparative pseudoknot prediction method that can handle long RNA sequences, based on the ranking on their website as of March 25, 2014 . We also noticed that Puton et al. used HotKnots V1 for their comparison, and not the more recently available and better performing Hot-Knots V2.0. Therefore we chose to include HotKnots in our comparisons as well.

Therefore, we use data set of Hajdin et al. to compare these two methods. In their data set Hajdin et al. have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set. We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 energy structure as the final output of our program. For Shapeknots, we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al. [47] to compare with Iterative HFold. Table 5 shows the results of this comparison. In all but one sequence of the test set, Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots. The exception is the HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain; Hajdin et al. note that the accepted structure of HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots. In the training set, however, Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots. This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Since both the training and test data sets are small, we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods.",

            "text": "To further investigate which input structures are good to use when G big is not known, we use the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by SimFold (including the MFE structure). Then for each RNA sequence we run our methods on all 50 suboptimal structures and choose the one with the lowest free energy as the final result for that RNA sequence. With this approach, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure of HFold and Iterative HFold is (61.80%, 80.63%) and (67.70%, 79.57%) respectively for pseudoknotted structures and (77.17%, 82.35%) and (76.27%, 81.46%) respectively for pseudoknot-free structures. The permutation test indicates that the difference between these results and the corresponding results when input structures are hotspots is not significant. We also test the significance of results of HFold with first 50 suboptimal structures versus Iterative HFold with the same input structures and Iterative HFold with hotspots for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures. Although the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals for average F-measures seem different, the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant. Similarly, results of Iterative HFold with the first 50 suboptimal structures are not significantly better or worse than the result of HFold with hotspots as input structures for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures.",

Similarly, if we compare the maximum accuracy structure output by Iterative HFold with the minimum free energy structure, whether given HotKnots hotspots or the first 50 suboptimal structures to Iterative HFold as input, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals of average F-measure also show improvement -see Table 6 . The difference in improvements is significant in all but one case, namely Iterative HFold on hotspots structures as input for pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set. We conclude that improvements on the energy parameter values for pseudoknotted structures may further improve accuracy of both HotKnots and Iterative HFold.",

On the HK-PK and HK-PK-free data sets, accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these. An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs, as calculated using the partition function [43] . Even better may be to calculate base pair probabilities for base pairs of pseudoknotted RNA structures; however this requires (n 5 ) time. Since HFold finds minimum free energy structure in O(n 3 ) time, conditional on the given input structure, we are currently investigating ways to develop an O(n 3 )-time partition function version of HFold that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure.",

IfHFold-PKonly results in a structure G \u222a G such that G is not the empty structure, then run HFold with sequence S and structure G , and store the result. Otherwise, simply store G as the result. See the following example. (We note that running HFold with S and G results in a structure G \u222a G , where it may be the case that G = G (i.e., G may not be part of the result of method 2).) Motivation: When input structure G does not agree with the reference G big structure, it may still be the case that HFold-PKonly finds the pseudoknotted structure G small (or a good approximation to G small ). A call to HFold with input G small may then find a better approximation to G big .

This suggests that an improved energy model for pseudoknotted structure prediction may improve accuracy of prediction algorithms for pseudoknotted structures.Another direction for future work can be to use Iterative HFold for structure prediction of two interacting RNA molecules. Iterative HFold may be well suited for this purpose because, given input structures for each individual input molecule, it allows for modification of these input structures as it explores potential base pairing interactions between the two molecules.",
