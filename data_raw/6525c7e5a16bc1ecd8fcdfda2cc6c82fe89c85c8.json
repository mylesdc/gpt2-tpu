Vero cells are susceptible to various types of microbes and toxins and have widely contributed to not only microbiology, but also the production of vaccines for human use. We here showed the genome landscape of a Vero cell line, in which 25,877 putative protein-coding genes were identified in the 2.97-Gb genome sequence. A homozygous \u223c9-Mb deletion on chromosome 12 caused the loss of the type I interferon gene cluster and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes in Vero cells. In addition, an \u223c59-Mb loss of heterozygosity around this deleted region suggested that the homozygosity of the deletion was established by a large-scale conversion. Moreover, a genomic analysis of Vero cells revealed a female Chlorocebus sabaeus origin and proviral variations of the endogenous simian type D retrovirus. These results revealed the genomic basis for the non-tumourigenic permanent Vero cell lineage susceptible to various pathogens and will be useful for generating new sub-lines and developing new tools in the quality control of Vero cells.",

One lineage of the most frequently utilized mammalian cell lines for these purposes is the Vero cell lineage, which was established from the kidney tissue of an African green monkey (AGM). The primary culture of this tissue was started on 27 March 1962 in Chiba University in Japan, several continuous cell sub-lines were obtained after passages for several months, and a sub-line was then chosen as the standard Vero cell line. 1, 2 Vero cells were found to be highly susceptible to various types of viruses including simian polyoma virus SV-40, 1,2 measles virus, 3 rubella virus, 4,5 arboviruses, 6, 7 and adenoviruses 7 soon after their establishment, and were later found to be also susceptible to bacterial toxins including the diphtheria toxin, 8 heatlabile enterotoxins, 9 and Shiga-like toxins (or 'Vero' toxins). 10, 11 After their global distribution, 12,13 the application range of Vero cells extended from virology in academic laboratories to diagnostic practices in hospitals and bacterial toxin assays. Vero cells have pseudo-diploid karyotypes 14 and are non-tumourigenic when a cell passage was not prolonged. 15, 16 Therefore, the Vero cell lineage has been successfully utilized as a cell substrate for human vaccines. 17, 18 Vero cells are still the first choice cell model for various types of life-threating emerging pathogens such as H5N1 influenza virus, 19 Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, 20 and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. 21 Animal substrates for vaccine manufacturing are desired to be shifted from animals and eggs to assured continuous cell lines, because animal materials have several concerns related to quality control, stable supply, and animal ethics. 17 -19 In addition, antigenic drift affecting the vaccination efficacy to humans, which often occurs during the proliferation of influenza viruses in hen eggs, 22 might be improved by shifting to vaccine strainsusceptible human or non-human primate culture cells.",

We here provided a draft sequence of the whole genome of the Vero cell lineage after massively parallel sequencing of the genome DNA and also karyological and RNA-seq analyses. The genome landscape gave a mechanical insight into events that had occurred during the establishment of the permanent cell line susceptible to various types of microbes.

Lot JCRB0111 (hereafter referred to as Vero JCRB0111) was expected to be a close relative to widely distributed Vero cell seeds such as ATCC CCL81 and WHO Vero 10-87. 1,2,12,13,33 -35 The heteroplantation of Vero JCRB0111 cells in immunocompromised nude mice (n \u00bc 10) did not produce any discernible tumours, while that of human cervical carcinomaderived HeLa cells produced tumours in nude mice at 100% efficacy. Thus, Vero JCRB0111 cells are nontumourigenic, which is consistent with previous findings of Vero cells being non-tumourigenic when their passage number was limited. 15, 16 When choosing the Vero JCRB0111 cell seed in this study, we confirmed that there was no microbial contamination in the seed using conventional tests. In addition, DNA-seq short reads, which were obtained to resolve the draft sequence of the whole Vero cell genome, were employed to comprehensively detect microbe-relevant sequences with a megablast search. No discernible sign of microbe-relevant sequences (except for endogenous retroviral sequences as shown below) was detected in the cell genome sample, which confirmed the absence of microbial contamination in the Vero cell seed.",

The same analysis on PBMC from normal female AGM showed 60 chromosomes ( Supplementary Fig. S1A) . 36 Because the G-banding karyotypes of Vero cells include several abnormal chromosomes (Fig. 1B) , M-FISH was applied to identify chromosomal rearrangements. Human M-FISH probes hybridized efficiently to AGM chromosomes and showed 32 syntenic blocks in normal AGM karyotypes (Fig. 1C ). This homology to humans was consistent with previous findings, 37 and implied that the human M-FISH signal pattern can be used as a normal AGM reference (Fig. 1C ). G-banding and M-FISH analyses revealed that 18 of 37 Vero metaphases represented a main clone with 59 chromosomes. M-FISH identified 40 segments in the Vero metaphases ( Fig. 1D) , which indicated the occurrence of one fusion and seven translocations. The fusion occurring between chromosomes 7 and 24 led to a reduction in the chromosome number from 60 to 59. Duplications and deletions were also detected in 6 chromosomes (Fig. 1D) , showing rearrangements involved in 14 chromosomes. However, major chromosomal rearrangements were not detected in the other 46 chromosomes by G-banding or M-FISH ( Fig. 1B  and D) , which suggested that a haploid chromosome set was retained in its original form. In addition to these common features, additional abnormalities were detected in 11 of 37 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). Although the other eight karyotypes were found to have similar abnormalities, the Vero cell line appeared to include several subclones. The main clone accounted for less than half of the population (18 of 37 cells) and the Vero cell line had a high cytogenetic heterogeneity.",

To clarify the species origin of the Vero cell lineage, we compared our reads with four previously reported complete mitochondrial sequences of Chlorocebus species: Chlorocebus aethiops, Chlorocebus tantalus, C. sabaeus, and Chlorocebus pygerythrus. 40 The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genomes of Old World monkeys is known to be markedly higher than that in nuclear genomes 41 ; therefore, the mitochondrial sequences of these four species had sufficiently diverged to cause mapping bias of short reads. We mapped the paired-end reads to all four Chlorocebus mitochondrial genomes as a reference and found that the mitochondrial genome of C. sabaeus had the highest coverage and lowest divergence to the mitochondrial genome of Vero cells (Supplementary Table S2 ).

A total of 92% of the unambiguous sites of the rhesus macaque draft genome was covered with high-quality reads, and the genotype was called with high confidence (genotyping quality score !45 and coverage !10), which indicated that the rhesus macaque genome would work as a reasonable reference sequence for analysing the Vero cell genome. Approximately 58.5 million SNVs were identified (Supplementary Table S3 ). Of these, 51.2 million and 7.3 million SNVs were homozygous and heterozygous, respectively. Most of the homozygous SNVs in the Vero cell line were attributed to evolutionary divergence between the genus Macaca and Chlorocebus, which was 8-12 million years ago. 42, 43 The estimated divergence between the rhesus macaque and Vero cell line genomes was 2.2%. The level of heterozygous SNVs in the Vero cell line was also high and was markedly higher than that in a human individual. 44 This may be partly explained by the higher genetic diversity within AGM populations. We also identified 2.9 and 2.7 million small deletions ( 28 bp) and insertions ( 44 bp), respectively (Supplementary Table S3 ).",

This discrepancy may have been due to technical limitations. The karyotyping results obtained showed that most of the translocation events occurred between the telomeric regions of chromosomes, which could not be identified by sequencing if chromosomes fused via repeat sequences. In addition, in order to filter out rare chromosomal rearrangements in a cell population, events that occurred in only one of the homologous chromosomes may not be identified in our filtering criteria. Therefore, the absence of translocation rearrangements by sequencing does not contradict the results of the karyological analysis, which showed that all or most chromosomal translocations were observed in one of the two homologous chromosomes (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1C and D) .

As for SRV associated with the vaccine-producing Vero E6 cell line (the parental cell line of which is ATCC CCL81), a frame-shifting single-nucleotide insertion in the polymerase gene was identified. 46 This frameshifting mutation was not detected in SRV associated with the Vero ATCC CCL81 cell line 47 or Vero JCRB0111 cell line (this study). SRV variant sequences lacking the U3 and R regions of 3 0 LTR were instead detected in Vero ATCC CCL81-associated SRV, 47 while the results of this study suggested that some SRV copies in the Vero JCRB0111 cell genome were defective in the env-3 0 LTR region (Fig. 4) . Thus, a large amount of diversity may occur in proviral SRV sequences during the passage of Vero cells.",

Many of these tests rely on conventional methodology, and some tests still use many experimental animals. The whole-genome sequence should be invaluable reference information to develop more rational and effective methods for identification, genetic stability, and microbial agents in pharmaceutical cell banks. For example, the currently authorized tests for cell identity consist of classical methods (e.g. isoenzyme analysis and G-band analysis) and more modern DNA profiling methods (e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphism and variable number of tandem repeats analysis). These tests, even if not all, require a considerable amount of time and money as well as well-trained technical skills, and some are not accurate enough to discriminate different cell lines established from the same biological species. This study presented a proof of the concept that PCR analysis will open a rapid and accurate alternative method for the cell identity test to detect unique chromosomal deletions (Fig. 3) . Metagenome analysis is a powerful approach that can be used to survey microbial contamination in biological pharmaceuticals. 46, 47, 54 This study also employed DNA-seq short reads of Vero cell genome DNA to comprehensively survey microberelated sequences in the cell sample, and detected no discernible sign of microbe-relevant sequences (except for endogenous SRV) in Vero JCRB0111 cells. In this direction, it is crucial to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous viral-like sequences, because the appearance of the former is inevitable and can serve as an internal positive control in metagenomic analysis for microbial agents. In addition, the heterogeneity in SRV sequences as discussed above may also be a good genomic signature for identifying a specific cell seed among various Vero cell sub-lines. The whole-genome ",

Although the genomic PCR confirmed the existence of breakpoint junctions for the 573 kb deletion in chromosome 21 and the 294 kb deletion in chromosome 9, a part of these regions appeared to exist somewhere in the genome (A; see also Supplementary Fig. S2). Amplicons corresponding to the deletions predicted in chromosomes 1 and 10 were produced not only from Vero cells, but also from AGM PBMC, while amplicons corresponding to the 'non-deleted' counterparts were not produced even from AGM PBMC (B; see alsoSupplementary Fig. S2), which indicated that our determined sequences for the Vero cell genome existed homozygously in these regions not only in Vero cells, but also in AGM PBMC. This paradox might be attributed to the possible incompleteness of the currently available version of the AGM whole-genome draft sequence or polymorphic state of the deletion within AGM populations. Normal Genome indicates the sequences predicted from the draft genome sequences of AGM and the rhesus macaque. Arrows indicate the primer positions used in the PCR analyses. The 'D' indicates the genomic deletion size predicted by the massively parallel sequencing system. The templates used were as follows: VJ, Vero JCRB0111; VA, Vero ATCC; P, AGM PBMC.
