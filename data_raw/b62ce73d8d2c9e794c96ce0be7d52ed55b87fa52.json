It is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) which is a member of the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. SFTSV has been classified as a BSL3 pathogen. There is a need to develop safe and affordable serodiagnostic methods for proper clinical management of infected patients. Methods: The full length nucleocapsid (N) gene of SFTSV Yamaguchi strain was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned to an expression vector pQE30. The recombinant (r) SFTSV-N protein was expressed by using Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system and purified under native conditions. rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG and IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems were established to detect specific human IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. One hundred fifteen serum samples from clinically suspected-SFTS patients were used to evaluate the newly established systems and the results were compared with the total antibody detecting sandwich ELISA system. Results: The native form of recombinant (r) SFTSV-N protein was expressed and purified. Application of the rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG ELISA to the 115 serum samples showed results that perfectly matched those of the total antibody sandwich ELISA with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. The rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgM ELISA missed 8 positive samples that were detected by the total antibody sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of rSFTSV-N-IgM capture ELISA were 90.59 and 100 %, respectively.",

In Japan, the case-fatality rate of 55 % (6/11) was apparently higher than that in China, where an average of 12 % of cases was fatal [13] . Data on the high fatality rate due to SFTSV indicate that SFTSV is a threat to human health.

It causes severe febrile illness with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia in the total blood cell count, and elevated levels of liver enzymes [16] .",

Virus isolation from the blood of viremic patients is the direct evidence of SFTSV infection, however, it is time-consuming and needs high security biocontainment facility [1, 2] . Detection of SFTSV genome could be achieved by different nucleic acid detection techniques such as reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) [1, 2] , real-time RT-PCR [14, 17] , reverse transcriptionloop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) [18] [19] [20] , reverse transcription-cross-priming amplification coupled (RT-CPA) with vertical flow (VF) visualization [21] . Although these techniques have high sensitivity and specificity in early diagnosis, the duration of viraemia in SFTSV infection is very short, generally 1-6 days after the disease onset [22] . Hence, the nucleic acid detecting techniques are applicable only during the acute phase of the disease which is within 1 week after its onset. The final confirmation of infection in many cases may rely on the detection of the specific antibodies to SFTSV.",

Nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most immunodominant viral proteins among members of the Bunyaviridae family. Recombinant N protein of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus, another member of the Phlebovirus genus, was reported to be used in a detection system for the laboratory diagnosis of RFV infection in humans and animals [24] [25] [26] . In SFTSV, Jiao et al. developed a recombinant N protein based sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the total antibodies against this virus in humans and animals [27] . In our present report, recombinant SFTSV-N (rSFTSV-N) protein was expressed by using Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system and then purified. rSFTSV-N protein based IgG ELISA and IgM ELISA systems were established. Serum samples from clinically-suspected SFTS patients were used to evaluate the newly established systems and results were compared with those obtained by using the total antibody detecting sandwich ELISA system.",

But the disadvantages of this method are that it cannot distinguish IgG from IgM and that more volume of the serum (serum used without dilution) is required for the assay thus, limiting its application for clinical diagnosis and large scale epidemiological studies. Our SFTSV-N protein based systems detect IgG and IgM separately, so it can distinguish previous or recent infection, respectively. The serum dilution is 1:1000 for IgG and 1:400 for IgM; this greatly save the serum used and will be quite beneficial for precious samples and large scale epidemiological studies. The rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG and IgM ELISA systems presented here eliminate the use of infectious virus in the antigen production, which requires high level of microbiological security facilities. Hence they are safer methods for diagnosis. The expression and purification procedure for recombinant SFTSV-N protein is simple and easy allowing an easy standardization of the antigen production. The advantages of using a prokaryotic host to produce recombinant SFTSV-N protein would be considerable due to the ease of scale-up, and the low costs involved in growing bacteria. It would be especially useful in cases of large-scale epidemiological investigation and for application in developing countries.",

The supernatant was then applied to a Talon\u2122 IMAC resin column (Clontech, USA). After being washed with a binding buffer (10 mM PBS with 500 mM NaCl containing 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5), the purified protein was eluted with an elution buffer (10 mM PBS with 500 mM NaCl containing 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). The protein solution was aliquoted and stored in a final concentration of 10 % glycerol at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad, USA), and the purity of the protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

These assays have common procedures which will be described here and the procedures specific for each assay will be described under each assay. The plates used were 96-well Nunc immunoplates (Thermo Scientific, Denmark), and all the reagents were in 100 \u03bcL volumes. The optimal concentration of rSFTSV-N protein used to coat the microplates was determined by checkerboard titration with reference serum samples (2 from SFTSconfirmed patients and 2 from healthy volunteers). The coating buffer was 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, and plate coating was conducted at 4\u00b0C overnight. Wash buffer was 0.01 M PBS with 0.1 % (vol/vol) Tween 20 (PBS-T). Plates were washed three times with PBS-T after exposure to a specific reagent at each step of the procedure except at the last step as described below. Dilution of all serum samples and reagents were in 5 % nonfat milk (Difco, Detroit, USA) in PBS-T. Incubations, except for substrate, were done for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates with 100 \u03bcL H 2 O 2 -ABTS substrate (Kirkegaatrd & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) in each well were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C.
