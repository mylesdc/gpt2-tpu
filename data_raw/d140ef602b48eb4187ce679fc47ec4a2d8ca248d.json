            "text": "Some viruses within the Caliciviridae family initiate their replication cycle by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), and/or terminal sialic acids (SAs). Although bovine nebovirus (BNeV), one of the enteric caliciviruses, is an important causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in cattle, its attachment factors and possibly other cellular receptors remain unknown. Using a comprehensive series of protein-ligand biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether BNeV recognizes cell surface HBGAs and/or SAs as attachment factors. It was found that BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) bound to A type/H type 2/Le y HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract and are related to HBGAs expressed in humans and other host species, suggesting a wide spectrum of HBGA recognition by BNeV. BNeV VLPs also bound to a large variety of different bovine and human saliva samples of all ABH and Lewis types, supporting previously obtained results and suggesting a zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission. Removal of \u24231,2-linked fucose and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs by confirmation-specific enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva, cultured cell lines, and bovine small intestine mucosa, further supporting a wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV through recognition of \u24231,2linked fucose and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs. However, removal of terminal \u24232,3and \u24232,6-linked SAs by their specific enzyme had no inhibitory effects on binding of BNeV VLPs, indicating that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. Further details of the binding specificity of BNeV remain to be explored. IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, and recoviruses are the most important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and many other mammalian host species. They initiate infection by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, HBGAs, and/or terminal SAs. However, the attachment factor(s) for BNeV, a recently classified enteric calicivirus genus/type species, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that BNeV VLPs have a wide spectrum of binding to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, and bovine duodenal sections. We further discovered that \u24231,2-linked fucose and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitopes are essential for binding of BNeV VLPs. However, BNeV VLPs do not bind to terminal SAs on cell carbohydrates. Continued investigation regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) will be necessary for better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.",

Viral attachment factors and receptors on host cells comprise a large variety of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids with physiological functions unrelated to pathogen interaction (3) . For many viruses, these receptors are glycans linked to either a protein (glycoprotein or proteoglycan) or a glycolipid (4) (5) (6) . Glycan-dependent viruses use glycoepitopes as receptors, binding to negatively charged sialic acids (SAs), sulfated oligosaccharide motifs of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, or neutral glycoepitopes such as those found on histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) (6) . SAs at the termini or inner portions of glycan chains serve as receptors for at least 10 different virus families, whereas representatives from at least eight different virus families use GAG chains as receptors (4) (5) (6) (7) . In contrast, only a few human and animal viruses within a few families, including Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Reoviridae, use HBGAs as receptors (2, 6, 8) . The selection of different glycoepitopes as attachment factors may contribute to virus tropism, pathogenesis, and host specificity (5, 6, 8, 9) .",

Recently, six additional unclassified caliciviruses may represent new genera, tentatively named Bavovirus (12, 13) , Nacovirus (13) (14) (15) , Recovirus (16) , Salovirus (17) , Sanovirus (18) , and Valovirus (19) . Caliciviruses are important etiologic agents in humans and animals, causing a variety of diseases in their respective hosts, such as respiratory disease (feline calicivirus [FCV] ), hemorrhagic disease (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus [RHDV]), and gastroenteritis (norovirus [NoV] , sapovirus [SaV] , and nebovirus [NeV] ).",

The initial observation that the Lagovirus RHDV uses the H type 2 HBGA as an attachment factor (20) inspired studies to identify similar factors for the other members of the Caliciviridae family (21) . These studies showed that different HBGAs are used as attachment factors for human NoVs (HuNoVs) (21, 22) , bovine NoV (23) , canine NoVs (24) , and primate enteric caliciviruses within the Recovirus genus (25) . In contrast, FCV (26) , murine NoV (MNV) (27) , and porcine SaV (PSaV) (28) utilize terminal SAs as attachment factors. Recently, it was observed that some HuNoVs and monkey recoviruses also utilize SAs as attachment factors (29, 30) . Finally, proteinaceous cellular surface structures were identified as receptors for a few caliciviruses, such as CD300lf and CD300ld for MNV (31, 32) and junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1) for FCV and Hom-1 calicivirus (33) (34) (35) .",

They can also be secreted as free oligosaccharides into bodily fluids, such as saliva, intestinal content, milk, and blood (2, 8) . The ABH and Lewis HBGAs are synthesized by the stepwise addition of monosaccharide units to five different types of precursor: type 1 (Gal\u2424-3GlcNAc\u24241-R), type 2 (Gal\u2424-4GlcNAc\u24241-R), type 3 (Gal\u2424-3GalNAc\u24231-R), type 4 (Gal\u2424-3GalNAc\u24241-R), and type 5 (Gal\u2424-4Glc\u24241-Cer) (36) . Each step is catalyzed by specific glycosyltransferases, such as \u2423-1,2 fucosyltransferase (FUT2), \u2423-1,3 or \u2423-1,4 fucosyltransferase (FUT3), and two glycosyltransferases (A and B enzymes) (2, 8) . For example, the \u2423-1,2 fucosyltransferase adds a fucose residue at the \u2423-1,2 linkage position of galactose, generating H antigen motifs (2, 8) . The addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or galactose at the \u2423-1,3 position of H type chains via A enzyme or B enzyme results in either A or B antigen (2, 8, 24) . The FUT3 gene, as well as the FUT4, FUT5, FUT6, FUT7, and FUT9 genes, generate the Lewis antigens by adding a fucose residue at either the \u2423-1,3 or \u2423-1,4 linkage position of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the type 1 and/or type 2 precursors (2, 8, 24) .",

Recently, two more species in the genus Nebovirus have been identified (39, 40) . The reported fecal prevalence of the bovine nebovirus (BNeV) in calf diarrhea is 5% in Tunisia (41), 4.8% in Brazil (42) , 7% in France (40) , 9.1% in Korea (38) , 13 .1% in Italy (43) , and 21.6% in the United States (44) . Moreover, the BNeV prototype strains Newbury-1 and Nebraska experimentally induce diarrhea and small intestinal pathology, such as the desquamation of villous epithelial cells and villous atrophy in gnotobiotic calves (45) (46) (47) . Despite its significant economic impact on the livestock industry and status as a pathogen with zoonotic potential, the BNeV life cycle remains largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation systems. Based on the information that either SAs or HBGAs are used as attachment factors for many caliciviruses, we hypothesized that BNeV also recognizes either SAs or HBGAs as attachment factors for entry and infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the interaction between BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) and either SAs or HBGAs using a comprehensive series of BNeV-ligand biochemical assays in synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, cell cultures, and bovine intestinal tissue sections.",

The binding of Alexa Fluor 594 (AF594)-labeled BNeV VLPs was slightly but significantly increased by pretreating the MDBK cells with 1 mM NaIO 4 but was markedly decreased with 10 mM NaIO 4 ( Fig. 2A) . Pretreatment of cells with NaIO 4 dose dependently decreased the binding of the SA-dependent FCV F9 strain, consistent with the high sensitivity of SA to periodate treatment (26) . HBGAdependent VLPs from the HuNoV strain VA387 showed a binding pattern similar to that of BNeV, indicative of binding to neutral sugars (51, 52) . However, 1 or 10 mM NaIO 4 pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on the binding of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain Nancy, which is known to use decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a cellular receptor (7, 53) .",

As expected, binding of BNeV VLPs increased to 124% with the 1 mM NaIO 4 treatment and decreased to 55% with the 10 mM NaIO 4 treatment compared with the mock-treated, VLP-inoculated control (Fig. 2B) .

SAs represent a family of sugar molecules that are found mostly at the terminal end of carbohydrates and attach to underlying glycans via \u24232,3, \u24232,6, or \u24232,8 linkages (4). Because several caliciviruses, including FCV, PSaV, and MNV, use terminal SAs as attachment factors (5, 26-28), we examined whether SAs act as attachment factors for BNeV using 100 mU Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (NA) ml \u03ea1 , which cleaves \u24232,3-, \u24232,6-, and \u24232, 8-linked SAs (26, 28) . Pretreatment of MDBK cells with NA increased the binding of AF594labeled BNeV VLPs to cells (Fig. 3A) , and the binding of RI-labeled BNeV VLPs to cells increased to 123% of the levels observed in the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3B) . A similar degree of enhanced binding was observed in the cells treated with HBGA-dependent HuNoV P particles (Fig. 3A) . However, SA-dependent FCV showed a marked reduction in cell binding, whereas with DAF-dependent CVB3 the NA pretreatment had no influence on the degree of binding to cells (Fig. 3) . These results support the notion that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors and that it uses neutral carbohydrate motifs such as HBGAs instead.",

Using a synthetic HBGA binding assay, we next determined whether HBGAs could be used as attachment factors for BNeV, as has been described for other viruses elsewhere (28, (54) (55) (56) . The BNeV VLPs strongly bound to the immobilized synthetic disaccharide (Fuc\u24231,2Gal) (Fig. 4A) , a common motif in HBGAs (57) . Moreover, sialyl-Le a (SLe a ), Le y , Le x , \u2423Gal, H2, H1, SLe x , A, and B type immobilized synthetic HBGA oligosaccharides interacted with the BNeV VLPs (ordered from highest to lowest binding degree) (Fig. 4A) . The recombinant FIG 1 Electron micrograph of BNeV VLPs from and detection of BNeV capsid protein in rMA415-infected insect cells by immunofluorescence assay. (A) The rMA415 VLPs were purified by CsCl gradients from the cell culture supernatants of rMA415infected Sf9 cells and visualized by negative staining with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). The panel on the right is a magnification of the panel on the left. The scale bars in the left and right panels correspond to 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively. (B) Sf9 cells were mock infected (left) or infected with rMA415. After 48 (middle) and 72 (right) h postinfection, cells were immunostained using the rabbit hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The scale bars for left and right panels correspond to 50 m. glutathione S-transferase (GST)-P particles of the HuNoV strain VA387 and the GST-VP8* proteins of the human rotavirus G11P [25] Dhaka6 and bovine rotavirus G6P [5] WC3 strains bound to their corresponding HBGA types, whereas the supernatant of wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and GST had no binding affinity to any HBGA (Fig. 4A) . These results indicate that BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs.",

To identify HBGA-binding epitopes, we examined whether removal of each putative epitope from synthetic HBGAs by pretreatment with \u24231,2-L-fucosidase, \u24231,3/4-L-fucosidase, \u2423-galactosidase, or \u2423-Nacetylgalactosaminidase was able to decrease the HBGA binding of BNeV VLPs. The results showed that treatment with \u24231,2-L-fucosidase, which removes the \u2423-1,2-linked fucose from galactose, significantly decreased the binding of BNeV VLPs to the H type disaccharide, H1 and H2 types, and Le y carrying an \u24231,2-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that BNeV VLPs recognize the \u24231,2-linked fucose as an epitope. In contrast, pretreatment with \u24231,3/4-L-fucosidase resulted in a significant reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to SLe a , Le x , SLe x , and Le y , which all harbor the \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B) , confirming binding specificity for this epitope. An almost complete reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to Le y , containing both \u24231,2and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitopes, was observed by combined pretreatment of synthetic Le y with both enzymes, \u24231,2-L-fucosidase and \u24231,3/4-L-fucosidase, supporting the above-described results that BNeV VLPs recognize both \u24231,2-linked fucose and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose. Pretreatment of the Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA with \u2423-galactosidase, which cleaves the \u2423Gal epitope in Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA, had no inhibitory effect on the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA (Fig. 4B) . However, it significantly reduced the binding of the control GST-VP8* protein of the \u2423Gal-dependent bovine rotavirus P [5] WC3 strain to the synthetic Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the \u2423Gal epitope is not recognized by the BNeV VLPs. Altogether, these results suggest that BNeV VLPs recognize fucose residues in \u24231,2 and \u24231,3/4 linkages.",

To further define the BNeV-binding HBGA epitopes, the expression levels of the different HBGAs were examined in several cell lines using antibodies specific for each HBGA. The bovine kidney epithelial MDBK, porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK, canine kidney epithelial MDCK, and feline kidney CRFK cells solely expressed Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells expressed H types 1 and 2, Le a , Le x , Le b , and Le y HBGAs, while human embryonic kidney epithelial 293T cells did not express any of the HBGAs examined. Among these cell lines, MDBK cells were selected to check whether \u2423Gal is recognized as an attachment factor for BNeV binding because of sole expression of the \u2423Gal epitope carrying Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA on the cell surface, whereas Caco-2 cells were selected to check whether \u24231,2-fucose and \u24231,3/4-fucose epitopes are used as BNeV attachment factors because of expression of multiple HBGAs containing \u24231,2-fucose and \u24231,3/4-fucose epitopes on the cell surface HBGAs. The binding of AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs to each cell line was then examined both before and after removal of all of the corresponding HBGAs expressed in each cell line by pretreatment with \u24231,2-L-fucosidase, \u24231,3/4-Lfucosidase, \u2423-galactosidase, or \u2423-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, either individually or in combination. As expected, removal of \u2423Gal from Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA by pretreatment with \u2423-galactosidase had no inhibitory effect on BNeV binding to the MDBK cells, supporting the conclusion that Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA is not used for BNeV attachment (Fig. 9A) . To confirm the efficacy of \u24231,2-L-fucosidase, \u24231,3/ 4-L-fucosidase, and \u2423-galactosidase, MDBK and Caco-2 cells were pretreated with HBGAs. \u24231,2-linked fucose, \u24231,3/4-linked fucose, \u2423Gal, and GalNAc epitopes were removed from each synthetic HBGA using the corresponding enzyme. Reduction in binding specificity to the VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus P [5] WC3 strain was determined using the HBGA-binding assay. The signal intensities were visualized by TMB at 450 nm in three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD from triplicate samples. each enzyme and then the samples were checked for efficient removal of fucose by using Ulex Europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1), which detects fucose residues (59), or an antibody specific to \u2423Gal. The pretreatment of cells with \u2423-galactosidase markedly removed \u2423Gal residue from MDBK cells, whereas a mixture of \u24231,2-L-fucosidase and \u24231,3/4-L-fucosidase significantly removed fucose residues from Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, pretreatment of MDBK cells with each fucosidase significantly decreased BNeV VLP binding (Fig. 9A) . These effects became more apparent when the cells were pretreated with the mixture (Fig. 9A) , even though the cells did not appear to express fucosylated HBGAs. This suggests that \u24231,2and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose residues not detected by these reagents nonetheless support the binding of BNeV VLPs to MDBK cells. Pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with either \u24231,2-L-fucosidase or \u24231,3/4-Lfucosidase also reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs (Fig. 9B) . The reduction was much enhanced by pretreatment of the Caco-2 cells with the \u24231,2-L-fucosidase and \u24231,3/4- well plates were determined using mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for each HBGA, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM antibody. After characterization of HBGA expression levels in each saliva sample, binding specificity of BNeV VLPs and VP8* protein of bovine rotavirus strain WC3 to each saliva sample was determined by saliva-binding assay. The horizontal red line represents the OD values for BNeV VLP binding for each saliva sample. The horizontal blue line represents the OD values for VP8* protein of bovine rotavirus WC3 strain. (B) Expression levels of each HBGA in 53 human saliva samples were determined as described above. Binding specificity of BNeV VLPs to each saliva sample was determined by saliva-binding assay as described in Materials and Methods.

Binding of BNeV VLPs to each sample was visualized using TMB and measured at 450 nm in three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD from triplicate samples.

CHO cells do not express any HBGA on the cell surface due to the lack of \u24231,2-fucosyltransferase activity and of either the A or B histo-blood group enzymes (60). Whether the above-described binding between BNeV VLPs and HBGAs was similar to that found in parental CHO or transfectant CHO cells, parent and transfectant CHO cells expressing H type 2, A type, B type, or Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGAs were examined. After the expression of each target HBGA in parental CHO and transfectant CHO cells, as confirmed (Fig. 10A) , binding of BNeV VLPs to parental and transfectant CHO cells was analyzed. Compared with that of parental CHO cells (H \u03ea /A \u03ea /B \u03ea ), to which AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs failed to attach, binding of BNeV VLPs was very prominent in CHO cells expressing H type 2 HBGA (H \u03e9 /A \u03ea /B \u03ea ) (Fig. 10B) . It was also detected, albeit less extensively, with A (H \u03e9 /A \u03e9 /B \u03ea ) and B (H \u03e9 /A \u03ea /B \u03e9 ) types (Fig. 10B ). As expected, CHO cells expressing Gal\u24233Gal\u24244GlcNAc\u2424 HBGA had no BNeV VLP binding (Fig. 10B) . Taken together, these findings support the overall conclusion that BNeV VLPs have a wide HBGA binding Determination of BNeV-binding HBGA epitopes in bovine duodenal epithelium. The above-described results showed that the BNeV VLPs had no binding specificity for terminal SAs on the cultured cell surface. To confirm these results in bovine intestinal tissues, whether removal of terminal or internal parts of cell surface carbohydrate moieties using 1 or 10 mM NaIO 4 pretreatment could influence the attachment of BNeV to bovine duodenal epithelium was examined (23) . Similar to the aforementioned findings (Fig. 2) , abolishment of BNeV binding to the duodenal epithelium was achieved with the 10 mM but not the 1 mM NaIO 4 pretreatment (data not shown), suggesting that neutral sugars are also involved in binding to gut tissue. Consistent with this finding, removal of \u24232,3and \u24232,6-linked SAs using NA from V. cholerae failed to inhibit BNeV VLP binding to gut epithelium (data not shown).",

Many caliciviruses attach to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, such as HBGAs or SAs (2, 28) . Here, we demonstrate that VLPs of the BNeV bind to a wide spectrum of HBGAs present as synthetic neoglycoconjugates, secreted in bovine and human saliva, or expressed by cultured cells and bovine duodenal epithelium. Among HBGA-dependent caliciviruses, some HuNoVs, particularly some GII.4 strains and the recently emerged GII.17 strains, are well known to have a wide binding spectrum of HBGAs in all ABO, Lewis, and secretor/nonsecretor types (2, 58, 61, 62) . Generally, it is considered that the multiple binding patterns of HuNoVs to HBGAs could be subdivided into two major binding groups: the A/B or Lewis binding groups (2, 51, 52) . The A/B binding group members, including VA387, Norwalk, and MOH strains, are considered to accommodate one or two epitopes of A/B and H HBGAs, i.e., galactose and/or \u24231,2-linked fucose. In contrast, the Lewis binding group members, such as the Boxer, VA207, and OIF strains, utilize \u24231,2-linked fucose and/or \u24231,3-linked fucose epitopes of H and Lewis HBGAs. In the present study, enzymatic removal of \u24231,2and \u24231,3/4-linked fucoses from the various HBGA backbones reduced BNeV binding to the corresponding synthetic HBGAs and saliva samples. These data indicate that similar to the human Lewis binding group, BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs via binding to their \u24231,2and \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitopes (2, 51, 52, 58, 61) . As expected, removal of the \u2423Gal or GalNAc epitopes had no inhibitory effect on BNeV VLP binding, indicating that BNeV does not use the \u2423Gal and GalNAc epitopes as attachment factors. Indeed, it is well known that bovine genogroup III NoV uses the \u2423Gal epitope, which is absent from human and pig gut epithelium, suggesting that neither humans nor pigs could be infected by bovine NoVs (23) . However, this remains to be explored.",

In addition, there is a slight reduction in BNeV binding to the bovine duodenal sections with the \u24231,3/4-L-fucosidase pretreatment because the \u24231,3/4-linked fucose epitope is present only in Le y HBGA.

In contrast to the reduced binding observed for the Tulane virus (29) , in this study, removal of terminal SAs from cell surface carbohydrates by NA and 1 mM NaIO 4 had no inhibitory effect on the binding of BNeV VLPs to the cells. Rather, pretreatment with NA and 1 mM NaIO 4 increased BNeV VLP binding. This may be due to increased access to fucosylated epitopes following removal of the charged SA motifs. However, pretreatment with 10 mM NaIO 4 markedly decreased the BNeV binding to the cells, possibly due to complete removal of HBGAs on the cell surface (23) . The lack of inhibition following NA treatment does not rule out the possibility that the internal SAs of gangliosides like GM1a are recognized (64) . However, the lack of sensitivity with the 1 mM NaIO 4 treatment strongly suggests that this is not the case.",

Unexpectedly, however, BNeV VLPs attached to MDBK cells and pretreatment of MDBK cells with these fucosidases inhibited BNeV binding to MDBK cells. The mechanism by which BNeV VLPs bind to MDBK cells remains unclear. Nevertheless, these data suggest that MDBK cells express fucosylated HBGAs, which could not be detected by the antibodies used in this study but could be degraded by fucosidases. The identification of specific fucose-containing epitopes on MDBK cells involved in BNeV binding forms the basis of an ongoing work.",

Some NoVs detected in humans and animals have a close genetic relationship and share target receptors, which has raised questions regarding the possibility of the zoonotic transmission of these viruses (24, 68) . For example, porcine NoV strains detected worldwide have close genetic relatedness to HuNoVs (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) . Moreover, HuNoV strain GII.4-HS66 induces diarrhea and intestinal pathology in piglets and calves, respectively (77, 78) . Recent studies have shown that primate enteric caliciviruses within the Recovirus genus share their HBGA attachment factors with HuNoVs (25, 79) . Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of these viruses has been clearly demonstrated by the high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (80, 81) . In the present study, BNeV utilized HBGAs that are commonly used by HuNoVs and other enteric caliciviruses. This suggests that BNeVs have the potential to infect humans and/or other species. In particular, VLPs from BNeV displayed wide-spectrum binding in human saliva and human and animal cell lines, further supporting the above-described hypothesis. It should be noted that bovines express type 2-based HBGAs in their digestive tract but humans have type 1-based structures in their digestive tract. Accordingly, HuNoVs appear to favor the recognition of type 1-based HBGAs (82, 83) . BNeVs might be less adapted to human infection, as neither the virus nor its specific antibody have been isolated from and detected in humans.",

Although robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation systems for BNeVs have not been established, more definitive evidence for the interspecies transmission of BNeVs can be obtained by the inoculation of the BNeV isolates into different species, such as human volunteers or piglets. Indirect evidence for interspecies transmission of BNeVs can be provided by the detection of antibodies against BNeVs in serum samples collected from humans and other animals, particularly those living in the abovedescribed environments (80, 84, 85) . Nevertheless, our results stress the need for more in-depth genomic and serological studies of BNeVs in humans and other species.",

Moreover, the usage of multiple HBGAs by BNeV VLPs and their ability to bind to human saliva suggest that BNeVs have the potential for zoonotic transmission. More in-depth epidemiological studies using human fecal and serum samples are required to determine the zoonotic potential of BNeVs. Similarly, continued investigations regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) are necessary for a better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.",

Briefly, the complete 2.3-kb capsid region (encoding the VP1-major capsid and VP2-minor capsid regions) of Bo/BNeV/MA415/04/KR was amplified from the above-described fecal sample by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with forward (5=-AAACATGAGTGACAACAAAAGCATCCCAGA-3=, nucleotide position 5055 to 5084 of VP1 region) and reverse (5=-TCAAACACTCGTGGTCGAGAACACTGAC-3=, nucleotide position 7360 to 7387 of VP2 region) primers designed from the full-length sequence of Newbury agent 1 strain in the GenBank database (accession number NC_007916). The amplicon was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, CA) and then transformed to DH5\u2423 competent cells (Enzynomics, Daejeon, South Korea). Plasmids were purified using GeneAll Hybrid-Q Plasmid Rapidpre (GeneAll, Seoul, South Korea), and the sequence (GenBank accession numbers EF528565 and MG009451) was verified using an ABI system 3700 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Using purified plasmid, the full-length cDNA copy of capsid gene was amplified by PCR with a forward primer (5=-CACAGGATCCATGA GTGACAACAAAAGCAT-3=) containing a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and reverse primer (5=-AATCTC GAGTCAAACACTCGTGGTCG-3=) containing an XhoI restriction site (underlined). After digestion with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes, the amplified fragments were subcloned into pFastBac1 baculovirus donor plasmid (ThermoFisher Scientific, Seoul, South Korea). The pFastBac1 donor plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli, and its resultant recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II reagent (by following the manufacturer's instructions; Invitrogen). BNeV VLPs were expressed in baculovirus recombinant-transformed Sf9 insect cells at 27\u00b0C and harvested at 5 to 7 days postinfection. The cloned recombinant baculovirus generated from pFastBac1 plasmid containing VP1 and VP2 regions of MA415 strain was designated rMA415 and propagated in Sf9 cells to make master virus stocks. BNeV VLPs were purified using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described elsewhere (7) . The protein concentrations of the VLPs were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of recombinant capsid protein was validated by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses as described elsewhere (48, 49, 88) .",

Coated plates were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, and each synthetic oligosaccharide-polyacrylamide (PAA)-biotin conjugate (10 g/ml) was then added and further incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Bound oligosaccharides were detected using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The signal intensities were visualized by 3,3=,5,5=-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Komabiotech), and the absorbance was read at 450 nm in a plate reader. For each step, the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween 20).",

Briefly, tissue sections of 3-m thickness were deparaffinized, rehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and washed in PBS. Thereafter, the sections were treated with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 20 min to quench endogenous peroxidase, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with PBS-BSA for 30 min at room temperature in a humid atmosphere to inhibit nonspecific binding. To determine the expression of HBGAs, duodenal sections were first treated with the primary MAbs specific for each HBGA and left at 4\u00b0C overnight. Washed sections were also either left untreated or treated with NaIO 4 at 1 mM or 10 mM in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 10-min incubation with 1% glycine in PBS to remove terminal or internal cell surface carbohydrate moieties or with enzymes for 18 h at 37\u00b0C for removal of each HBGA epitope or cleaving terminal SAs from epithelial cells. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with 10 g/ml BNeV VLPs, diluted in PBS-BSA, and left at 4\u00b0C overnight. They were then washed thrice with PBS-BSA and incubated with a rabbit hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dako) followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako).
