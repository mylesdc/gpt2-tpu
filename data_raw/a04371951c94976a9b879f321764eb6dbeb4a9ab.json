In this study, the effect of glycyrrhizin on pseudomonal skin infections was studied in a chimera model of thermal injury. Two different chimera models were utilized. Patient chimeras were created in murine antimicrobial peptide-depleted NOD-SCID IL-2rc null mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with the same patient peripheral blood CD31 + IMC. Patient chimera substitutes were created in the same mice that were grafted with NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31 + IMC. In the results, both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin resisted a 20 LD 50 dose of P. aeruginosa skin infection, while all chimeras in both groups treated with saline died within 3 days of the infection. Human antimicrobial peptides were detected from the grafted site tissues of both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin, while the peptides were not detected in the same area tissues of controls. HBD-1 was produced by keratinocytes in transwell-cultures performed with CD31 + IMC and glycyrrhizin. Also, inhibitors (IL-10 and CCL2) of HBD-1 production by keratinocytes were not detected in cultures of patient CD31 + IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from pseudomonal grafted site infections in a chimera model of burn injury is controllable by glycyrrhizin. Impaired antimicrobial peptide production at the infection site of severely burned patients may be restored after treatment with glycyrrhizin.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound infection frequently develops into sepsis in severely burned patients [1] [2] [3] . As an initial effector of host antibacterial innate immunities, antimicrobial peptides distributed in skin tissues contribute to control surface (wound) infections [4] [5] [6] [7] . In severely burned patients, however, sufficient amounts of antimicrobial peptides are not produced in tissues surrounding the burn sites [8] [9] [10] . The lack of antimicrobial peptide production leads to the invasion of pathogens from surface infections to systemic infections [11] . In our accompanying paper [10] , lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 + cells (designated as CD31 + IMC) isolated from peripheral blood of severely burned patients (patient CD31 + IMC) were shown to be inhibitory on the HBD production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Lineage 2 CD34 + cells isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood were shown to be non-inhibitory on the peptide production by NHEK, and these cells were characterized as lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 2 cells. Lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 + cells were not isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood. CCL2 and IL-10 released from patient CD31 + IMC were identified as inhibitory factors for the HBD production by NHEK.",

To test the beneficence of glycyrrhizin in a more clinical setting, in this study, the anti-pseudomonal effect of glycyrrhizin was investigated in a human model of the severe burn injury combined with pseudomonal skin infections. In addition, the effect of glycyrrhizin on the suppressor cell activities of patient CD31 + IMC on the HBD-1 production was investigated at the grafted site tissues in the chimeras. A human model of severe burn injury was c-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc null mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with their syngeneic peripheral blood CD31 + IMC (patient chimeras), or grafted with cultured NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31 + IMC (patient chimera substitutes). Experimentally induced CD31 + IMC were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers 24 hours after intense exercise on a treadmill for 1 continuous hour, as previously described [13] . These cells have been shown to transiently appear after intense exercise (heart rate baseline: 130-145 beats per minute) for one continuous hour (first appeared 12 hours after exercising, peaked 24 hours after exercising, and then disappeared).",

According to the recent information obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (http://jaxmice.jax.org/events/2011/ 032411UNIVIL nsg.pdf), we utilized these mice as mice that are deficient in both innate and adoptive immunities (without functional T cells, B cells, and NK cells). Also, these mice are carriers of defective functions (phagocytosis, digestion, antigen presentation, and activation) of macrophages [28] [29] [30] [31] . Before being used in our experiments, these mice were exposed to whole body c-irradiation (4 Gy) to deplete neutrophils. Bone marrow cells or peripheral blood cells taken from these mice have been tested morphologically for residual neutrophils after Wright-Giemsa and alkaline phosphatase staining. In the results, neutrophils were not recovered from these mice 1 to 7 days after c-irradiation, even when they were stimulated with pathogens. After c-irradiation, these mice were housed in the BSL-2 Animal Facility, and fed autoclaved food and water to avoid infectious complications.",

When glycyrrhizin is utilized in experiments, 1,000 mg of the compound was first dissolved in 1 ml of saline or serum free RPMI medium at room temperature (1,000 mg/ml). Then, it was further diluted to the appropriate concentrations with saline or serum free RPMI medium and stored at 4uC until utilized. Based on our previous data [12, 13] , 1-100 mg/ml concentrations of glycyrrhizin were added to the tissue cultures, and 1 to 10 mg/kg doses of the compound were administered to the chimeras.

            "text": "The importance of b-defensins on host resistance against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection has been reported [4] [5] [6] [7] . In our accompanying paper [10] , lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 + cells (CD31 + IMC) that appeared in peripheral blood of severely burned patients have been shown to be responsible for inhibiting HBD-1 production by NHEK. In the first series of experiments in this study, the role of skin antimicrobial peptides on the resistance of mice against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection and subsequent sepsis was confirmed in cirradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc 2/2 mice depleted of murine skin antimicrobial peptides. c-Irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc 2/2 mice lack functional immunocompetent cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. As a result, all these mice depleted of murine skin antimicrobial peptides (mouse B) died after infection with 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa, while all of the mice with the peptides (mouse A) survived even though they were exposed to the same infection ( Fig. 1a-1) . Also, murine antimicrobial peptide (MBD-1) was detected in skin homogenates of c-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc 2/2 mice, while this peptide was not detected in those of the same mice treated with antimurine AMP rabbit IgG. Human antimicrobial peptide (HBD-1) was not detected in the skin homogenates of c-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc 2/2 mice treated with or without the IgG (Fig. 1a-2 ). In the next experiments, these mice depleted of the murine peptides were grafted with NHEK (1610 6 cells/mouse, i.d.) and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31 + IMC at the grafting site tissues. Then, these mice were infected with 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa at the grafted site tissues, and their mortality rates were observed. As a result, all of the chimeras created with NHEK alone (chimera A) survived after P. aeruginosa i.d. infection. However, all of the chimeras created with NHEK grafting and experimentally induced CD31 + IMC inoculation (chimera B) died within 3 days of the same infection ( Fig. 1b-1) . All chimera B without any infections with P. aeruginosa survived for 2 weeks or more. HBD-1 was detected in homogenates of grafted site tissues of chimera A, while HBD-1 was not detected in grafted site skin homogenates of chimera B (Fig. 1b-2) . These results indicate that host antibacterial resistance of chimeras created with NHEK against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection is completely inhibited by experimentally induced CD31 + IMC. Chimera C, created with healthy donor lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 2 cells, were shown to be resistant against 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection (Fig. 1c-1) . As shown in chimera C, the amount of HBD-1 produced in chimera A was not influenced by healthy donor peripheral blood lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 2 cells (Fig. 1c-2) , indicating that lineage 2 CD34 + CD31 2 cells do not suppress HBD-1 production. The results shown in Figs. 1a, 1b, and 1c indicate that skin antimicrobial peptides (a, murine peptides; b and c, human peptides) are very important in the resistance of mice to P. aeruginosa i.d. infections, and CD31 + IMC are responsible for inhibiting HBD-1 production by skin tissues.",

Antibiotics are effective against topical wound infections and subsequent development of sepsis in severely burned patients [3] . However, antibiotic chemotherapies often encourage abnormal microflora and multi-antibiotic-resistant bacterial generation. Therefore, a new paradigm to treat opportunistic burn wound infections is urgent for severely burned patients. In our murine studies, P. aeruginosa burn wound infection and subsequent sepsis have been immunologically controlled by glycyrrhizin [12] . This suggests that a glycyrrhizin therapy may be the new paradigm to treat severely burned patients with P. aeruginosa burn wound infection. To establish anti-pseudomonal efficacies of glycyrrhizin in a more clinical setting, in this paper, the protective effect of glycyrrhizin on sepsis stemming from P. aeruginosa skin infections was studied in a chimera model of severely burned patients. The experiments were performed in c-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc null mice grafted with unburned skin tissues (discarded small pieces of skin that were utilized for autograft surgery) of severely burned patients and their syngeneic peripheral blood CD31 + IMC (patient chimeras). Also, in one part of the infection experiments, patient chimera substitutes (c-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2rc null mice grafted with cultured NHEK and experimentally induced CD31 + IMC) were utilized, because sufficient numbers of burn patient peripheral blood CD31 + IMC were not available. Immunological similarities of patient chimeras and patient chimera substitutes have been demonstrated by (i) impaired production of human skin antimicrobial peptides, (ii) increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa i.d. infection, and (iii) remarkable production of human CCL2 and IL-10 (effector factors for patient CD31 + IMC to inhibit antimicrobial peptide production).",

The greatest efficacy of glycyrrhizin on recovering HBD-1 production was seen in the chimeras treated with a 10 mg/kg dose of glycyrrhizin. The protective effect of glycyrrhizin against graft site P. aeruginosa i.d. infection was examined in patient chimeras that were previously eliminated of murine skin antimicrobial peptides. This syngeneic experimental system may display accurate antibacterial responses shown by severely burned patients with P. aeruginosa burn wound infection. After infection with P. aeruginosa at the grafted site, bacteria grew in kidneys of the chimeras, while bacteria were not detected in kidneys of the same chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from grafted site P. aeruginosa infection is not developed in patient chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. The effect of glycyrrhizin on the survival of patient chimera substitutes i.d. infected with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa was also tested. As a result, all of the chimeras treated with saline died within 3 days of infection, but 100% of the same chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin survived more than 7 days after the same infection. The results obtained in the chimera studies strongly indicate that glycyrrhizin is beneficial to treat pseudomonal burn wound infection and subsequent sepsis in severely burned patients.",

Most individuals treated with high doses of glycyrrhizin (400 mg or more) experience some adverse effects, such as hypermineralocorticoidism with sodium retention and potassium loss, edema, increased blood pressure and depression of the rennin-angiotensinaldosterone system [36] . These adverse effects are due to the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin in the intestine to the pharmacologically active compound glycyrrhetic acid, which inhibits the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that is involved in the metabolism of corticosteroids. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to increased cortisol levels in the kidneys [36] . In our studies, however, non-toxic doses of the compound are shown to be active in the protection of chimeras infected with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa in grafted site tissues. For the clinical utilization of glycyrrhizin against burn wound infections in severely burned patients, more detailed toxicology tests are required.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin did not have any direct action on the growth of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the protective effect of glycyrrhizin against grafted site pseudomonal infections in chimeras must be displayed through the host's antibacterial functions influenced by glycyrrhizin. In previous murine studies [12] , glycyrrhizin-associated improvement on antimicrobial peptide production is shown to be key on the protection of severely burned mice with pseudomonal wound infections. The importance of skin antimicrobial peptides against invasion of pathogens in wound tissues has been well-described [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, antimicrobial peptides are not produced in skin tissues surrounding the burn wound [8, 11] , and small numbers of the pathogen that invaded the burn wound can spread easily into the whole body [11] . Skin antimicrobial peptides were produced in tissues surrounding the burn area of mice treated with glycyrrhizin [12] . Since glycyrrhizin had no stimulating activities on the antimicrobial peptide production by skin keratinocytes, glycyrrhizin may improve the peptide production by keratinocytes indirectly. Gr-1 + CD11b + IMC have been identified as murine effector cells on burn-associated impairment of the peptide production [11] . In this human study, CD31 + IMC have been identified as cells that inhibit the peptide production by skin keratinocytes. Human antimicrobial peptides were not produced by unburned skin tissues in transwell-cultures with their syngeneic CD31 + cells. In this transwell-culture, the effect of glycyrrhizin on the improvement of the peptide production was tested. In the results, the peptides were produced in this transwellculture supplemented with glycyrrhizin. Subsequently, CCL2 and IL-10 released from CD31 + IMC were shown to be inhibitory on the peptide production by skin keratinocytes, and these cytokines were not produce by CD31 + IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. All of these facts strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin on the production of IL-10 and CCL2 by CD31 + IMC may be important in the anti-pseudomonal activity of the compound.",

Recent studies have indicated that glycyrrhizin binds to the glucocorticoid-like receptor [37] and mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) [38] . Because the enhancer region of the CCL2 gene is inhibited by glucocorticoids, progesterone, and estrogen in cells stimulated with inflammatory mediators [39, 40] , the binding of glycyrrhizin to the glucocorticoid-like receptor may result in the inhibition of CCL2 gene activation. The phosphorylation of HMGB1 by casein kinase I and protein kinase C promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines; however, the phosphorylation of HMGB1 is inhibited by glycyrrhizin after binding [38] . These inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizin on the transcriptional factors may be involved in controlling cytokine production by CD31 + IMC. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizin on the activation of NF-kB, STAT3 and MAPKs (including JUNK, p38 and ERK) in monocytes/macrophages have been demonstrated during acute inflammatory responses [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . The activation of NF-kB and MAPKs is important for CCL2 production [47] , and the increased production of CCL2 requires STAT3 activation [48] . These molecular mechanisms influenced by glycyrrhizin may also be involved in suppressing cytokine production by CD31 + IMC. Further analytical studies are required.",
