A unique sequence was defined as a 25 nucleotide region that contained either a run of two or more different nucleotides at the central (13 th nucleotide) position, or two or more non-contiguous, different nucleotides within eight nucleotides of the 13 th nucleotide. These parameters were dictated by the fact that a run of centrally located, mismatched nucleotides or closely-spaced mismatched nucleotides would significantly destabilize the hybridization between the labeled target DNA and the oligonucleotide probe on the microarray. Unique nucleotide sequences identified by this program and selected full genomic sequences of CTV isolates were then tiled on the GeneChip CustomSeq resequencing array with an 8-\u00b5m feature size using the Affymetrix photolithographic manufacturing process (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The complete tiling of 117,088 nucleotides comprises four full-length CTV genomes, one partial genome, and unique sequences from other CTV isolates. In addition, 807 nucleotides from an artificial cDNA clone were included as an internal control. For each nucleotide tiled on the array, four 25-mer oligonucleotides (a quartet) corresponding to the sense strand and four oligonucleotides representing the antisense strand were tiled on the microarray. Thus, the microarray contains a total of 943,160 25-mer oligonucleotide probes.",

The sequence fragments and the associated quality scores were converted into fasta-format files, and were used to assemble full and partial CTV genomic contigs using the Phrap program [11] implemented in the CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode, Dedham, MA). After experimenting with a wide range of parameters, the following Phrap command parameters produced reliable and reproducible alignments and consensus contigs that reflected the true nature of the genotype(s) in samples: -penalty -2minmatch 10 -maxmatch 10 -minscore 12 -vector_bound 0 -masklevel 100 -trim_start 0 -trim_qual 4 -forcelevel 0.",

Bayesian inference of phylogenetic relationships was carried out using MrBayes 3.12 [12] , using the general time-reversal model with gamma-shaped rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I+G). This model was determined as the best-fit model for phylogenetic inferences of the input sequences using the ModelTest program [13] . Two parallel runs of Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of one cold and three heated chains were then carried out for at least 5,000,000 generations, or until the average standard deviation of split frequencies reached 0.01. One tree was sampled for every 200 generations during the simulation. A consensus tree was constructed from the sampled trees after a burn-in of two-fifth of the sample trees. The Bayesian posterior probability for each node was calculated as the proportion of sampled trees containing the node. With a few exceptions on minor nodes, the posterior probability on all major nodes approached 1.00 after the extensive phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were then visualized using the TreeView program [14] . Cross-over junctions of the recombinant molecules were determined initially by RDP2, a recombination detection program that deploys ten published methods to detect recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoints [15] and subsequently confirmed by visually inspection .",

Equimolar amounts of each fragment were pooled; an amount of amplified DNA equivalent to 0.055 pmoles of CTV genome was then fragmented to 20 to 200 bp and labeled with biotin-dNTP by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase according to the Resequencing Assay Protocol 2.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization of the target DNA to the microarray was carried out in GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, according to the instructions provided by Affymetrix. The target DNA bound to the probes on the microarray was stained using a three-stage process consisting of streptavidinphycoerythrin (SAPE) stain, amplification with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibodies, and a final stain with SAPE. The microarray was then scanned at a resolution of 1.563 \u00b5m/pixel using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. The scanned image was automatically gridded, and the signal for each probe was statistically averaged using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software version 1.4. The final probe intensity dataset was analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ)",
