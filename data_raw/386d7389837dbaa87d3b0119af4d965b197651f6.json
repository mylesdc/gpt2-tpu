The tRNA and rRNA reads were removed by Bowtie (v1.0.1, -l 20) (Langmead et al. 2009 ). The reads were mapped to both the human genome (Ensembl, GRCh37) and EV71 genome (GenBank, AB469182.1) using Tophat (v2.0.11) ). Raw counts of protein-coding genes were quantified by HTSeq (v0.6.1p2) (Anders et al. 2015) . Raw counts of host genes and EV71 genes were combined, and reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads (RPKMs) were calculated by edgeR (Robinson et al. 2010) . The raw read numbers were normalized to the total reads of the host cell and EV71. RPKMs of the host genes were used to calculate differentially expressed genes at both transcriptional (mRNA) and translational (RPF) levels, by comparing the expression levels in EV71-infected cells to corresponding levels in mock-infected cells at a given time point. Genes with a RPKM value \u2265 0.3 and an absolute value of fold changes \u2265 2 were identified as differentially expressed. The use of threshold of RPKM value \u2265 0.3 is to rule out those non bona fide expressed genes (Ramsk\u00f6ld et al. 2009 ). Enriched pathways were analyzed using DAVID GeneOntology (Huang et al. 2009b, a) . Reads were visualized using Mochiview as instructed in the manual (Homann and Johnson 2010) .",

RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 at an MOI of 40. At the indicated time post infection, cells were collected for library construction following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, the cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) nine min before harvesting and lysis. The cell lysate was split into two portions. One portion was used for mRNA extraction using the Dynabeads\u00ae mRNA DIRECT\u2122 Kit (Thermo Fisher), followed by RNA fragmentation. The other portion was used for ribosome protected RNA fragment purification. The RNA fragments for RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were end repaired and ligated with adaptors. Then, reverse transcription and circularization were achieved depending on the adaptors. The rRNA and tRNA sequences were removed by annealing with biotin labeled oligos after reverse transcription. After PCR amplification by index, all the products were purified by 8% native Polyacrylamide/TBE gel (BioRad). Quality control and deep sequencing were carried out using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at the Beijing Genomics 5 Institute (BGI).",
