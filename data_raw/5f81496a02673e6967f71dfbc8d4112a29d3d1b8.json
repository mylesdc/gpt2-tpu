Thus, 3\u2032-SL was further studied for in vivo study against H9N2 virus in pathogen free chicken experiment models. In vivo study exhibited improved clinical symptoms on H9N2 infected chickens when treated with 3\u2032-SL. Moreover, treating chickens with 3\u2032-SL resulted in complete elimination of H9N2 viruses within 24 h of virus infection (0.8 HAU of H9N2). Indirect ELISA assay confirmed complete wash-out of H9N2 viruses from the colon after neutralization by 3\u2032-SL without entering the blood stream. These in vivo results open up possible applications of 3\u2032-SL for the prevention of AI virus infections in birds by a simple cleansing mechanism.",

            "text": "We assayed two derivatives of sialyllactose (3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL) (Fig. 1) against thirteen different viruses included in six different subtypes (Table 1) in preliminary HI assay. The concept of HI assay using various concentrations of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL studies the effectiveness of the prevention of binding of viruses to the chicken red blood cells (cRBCs) by SL derivatives. Sialic acid moiety of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL binds to the hemagglutinin present in viruses. As a result, viruses are neutralized, hence preventing hemagglutinin mediated binding of viruses with sialic acids present in the surface of cRBCs. We determine the highest diluted concentration of SL-derivatives that prevents hemagglutination of cRBCs to be the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Fig. 2) . 3\u2032-SL showed promising results with all thirteen viral strains tested in this assay. Except H1N1 subtypes of viruses and one H1N2 subtype virus In vitro anti-viral test of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL against H9N2 using MDCK cell. To study the efficacy of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL against H9N2 (A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/1996) virus in vitro, MDCK cell line was used and checked for cytopathic effect (CPE). Different number of viruses ranging from 2 11 \u00d7 10 \u22121 to 2 11 \u00d7 10 \u22128 HAU were mixed with 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL in dose dependent manner (12.5 mM to 200 mM) and used to infect approximately equal number of MDCK cells grown in 96 well plate as described in Methods. Positive experiment controls were kept without mixing viruses and either of the molecules, while negative control contained only MDCK cells and MEM medium. The detail experimental design is presented in Fig. 3 (i). The summary of the outcome of the experiment is presented in Table 2 and supported by photographs of immunostained MDCK cells in Fig. 3 (ii) to observe CPE and non-CPE cells during experiments. 11 HAU was serially diluted to x10 8 folds. Each ten folds diluted virus sample was used to assay against different doses (12.5 to 200 mM) of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL. The well shown within blue box (lane 1-5) were used for 3\u2032-SL while wells within yellow box (lane 7-11) were used for 6\u2032-SL. Each well in column of 3\u2032-SL or 6\u2032-SL containing different concentration of SHMOs were mixed with serially diluted H9N2. Lane 6 was positive control (PC) while lane 12 was negative control (NC). Plus (+) sign inside the well indicates cytopathic effect observed while minus (\u2212) sign indicates non-cytopathic effect. Green circle well shows immunofluorescence staining while red square indicates photographs taken and presented. Minus (\u2212) sign inside green circle indicates non-CPE but partial fluorescence observed in the photograph. (ii) Photograph of MDCK cells after immunostaining. Selected photographs are presented as indicated in experimental design (red circled wells) in Fig. 3 The viral invasion of cell lead to lysis of the host cell or cell dies without cell lysis. Both of these phenomenon are due to CPE. The CPE was detected using two sets of antibodies as described in Methods. The virus infected cells were methanol fixed and treated with primary monoclonal antibody which is specific to nucleoprotein of H9N2 AI virus. The buffer washed cells were then visualized using anti-mouse fluorescein functionalized with an isothiocyanate reactive group (anti-mouse FITC) secondary antibody which gives green color upon binding with 3B19 antibody. Thus, the results were interpreted as green colored cells as virus lysed dead cells or CPE while non fluorescent cells as live cells or non-CPE.",

Among many AI virus infections, H9N2 infection is an endemic outbreak in Korean poultry farms. It demonstrates clinical signs of depression, edema of head, cyanosis of comb and legs, and drop in egg production; and has a mortality rate of (5-30)% 20 . During the first outbreak of H9N2 in 1996, vaccination against AI viruses was not allowed. Later, its use was permitted in 2007, which efficiently prevented the spread of H9N2 21 . However, it was reported that Korean H9N2 subtype AI virus underwent antigenic drift by mutation at the antigenic sites, and could escape vaccine protection because of the excessive use of animal vaccination 22, 23 . The consequence of antigenic drift could be new outbreaks of H9N2 in the near future. Thus, several vaccination strategies to animals are in practice to confront future outbreaks of H9N2 in Korea, and approaches are further advanced because of abundant genetic information on AI viruses. But vaccination against AI viruses has several issues related to the international trade of poultry and poultry products, and AI virus surveillance programs 23 . Thus, the search continues for a safe and effective alternative approach to control such infections and outbreaks, because in many cases, pre-existing vaccines and antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of infections are not appropriate. Recent studies on the binding affinity of AI A viruses hemagglutinin display preferences towards \u03b12,3-linked sialyl glycans, while human influenza viruses are found to bind with \u03b12,6-linked sialyl glycans [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Meanwhile, several studies have established the significance of SHMOs such as sialyllactose as a health beneficiary to humans, particularly infants, to gain resistance to microbial infections by neutralizing them, and preventing invasion 29, 30 . Extensive studies have been carried out on sialyllactoses (3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL) that compete with binding sites, and prevent the adhesion of pathogens such as Salmonella 31,32 , Escherichia coli [31] [32] [33] [34] , Helicobacter pylori 32 , Vibrio cholera 31 , Compylobacter jejuni 32 and rotaviruses 35 . Bacteria have been found to contain more than one adhesion protein in their surface. Moreover, other various factors also determine their adhesion to the receptors on the host cell surface, such as hydrophobic interactions, and non-specific interactions. Hence, preventing bacterial population from adhesion by a single anti-adhesion molecule is challenging and ineffective. Hence, multiple agents targeting each adhesion protein are necessary to effectively control pathogens by using anti-adhesion therapy 36, 37 .",

Similarly, other carbohydrate molecules \u03b1-methyl-galactoside and \u03b1-methyl-fucoside decreased mortality and health damage, after P. aeruginosa challenged lung injury 39 . The major drawback of the use of such sugar analogs is the requirement in higher dose to achieve bacterial adhesion inhibition, because of their low affinity with the target protein. In some instances, the problem has been addressed by linking with hydrophobic residues, which significantly increases the affinity of carbohydrate molecules with target proteins, lowering the concentration of analogs required for anti-adhesion [40] [41] [42] . However, the clinical trials of 3\u2032-SL for the prevention of H. pylori in human 43 and Rhesus monkeys 44 and 3\u2032-sialyllacto-N-neotetraose against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus infuenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis 45 were interrupted because of the use of multiple adhesins by these bacteria.",

The efficacy of virus neutralization was different with different molecules in in vitro HI assay (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the MIC values were also different for the strains of the same HA subtype viruses. For example, among five H1N1 subtype strains, 3\u2032-SL neutralized A/Swine/Iowa/15/30 efficiently (MIC = 31.25 mM) than other four strains for which MIC values were 100 mM or above. Likewise, among two strains of H1N2 subtype viruses, the MIC value for A/Swine/Korea/PZ4/2006 was higher (62.5 mM) than A/ Swine/Korea/274-3 for which the value was 15.62 mM. The MIC values of three strains of H3N2 subtype viruses was also different. The similar pattern was observed in the case of 6\u2032-SL with the same sets of viruses (Fig. 2) . The possible reason for different antiviral efficacy by the same molecule against the same HA subtype virus strains could be because of the different receptor specificities of the HA of viruses 46 . Several previous studies established key role of HA present on viruses that account in part to determine avidity of receptor binding 24, 26, 46 . Thus, simple sequence analysis and homology modeling of HA does not always provide enough evidences to draw conclusions on receptor specificity of HA of strains belonging to the same HA subtype.",

            "text": "The same sialic acid containing molecule was applied for the control of H9N2 (A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/1996) virus infection in chickens for the first time. Since influenza virus uses haemagglutinin protein, a single receptor binding site for adhesion to host cells, it could be easy to neutralize and prevent infecting viruses from binding and invading host cell epithelia by generating competition on the binding site by feeding receptor analogs, as Fig. 6 depicts. The mechanism of preventing pathogens for adhesion to host cell receptors and invasion of host cell during infection cycle; and finally eliminating them out of the body by simple wash out is well established as cleansing mechanism (Fig. 6) . This mechanism is also naturally present in animal's immune defense system. 3\u2032-SL mimicked as host cell receptors of epithelial cell to H9N2 virus which preferentially bind to \u03b12,3-linked sialyl glycans present in avian mucus cells. Thus, 3\u2032-SL effectively neutralized H9N2 virus by binding at its receptor binding sites and apparently removing them from colon by simple wash out (Figs 4 and 6) . Interestingly, when 0.8 HAU of viruses were used to challenge the chickens and treated with 3\u2032-SL every day, the virus load was nil within 24 hours. There were no observable clinical signs, symptoms, or side effects in all chickens receiving 3\u2032-SL. ELISA assay of the sera of the chickens also confirmed the complete prevention of virus entry into the blood stream, since we detected no antibody against H9N2 virus. Viruses used for infection were completely neutralized by 3\u2032-SL and excreted out of the body within 24 hours, as we detected no virus in the oral and cloacal swab samples (Fig. 4) . Thus, this molecule could be a promising compound for the prevention of H9N2 virus infection in chickens. Although anti-adhesion therapy needs a higher dose of non-toxic molecules, multimers of 3\u2032-SL containing molecules will certainly address this problem, and lower the use of 3\u2032-SL concentration to prevent virus adhesion. On the other hand, 3\u2032-SL is a non-toxic molecule that is naturally present in human milk. It also did not exhibit toxic effect at 200 mM in MDCK cells in in vitro experiment (Table 2) . Thus, there is no doubt on the toxicity issue of this molecule, which is completely safe to humans and other animals.",
