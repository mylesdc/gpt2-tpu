Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence. Levels of coronavirus antibodies were also higher in fungal-infected bats. Our results suggest that the systemic effects of WNS may down-regulate anti-viral responses in bats persistently infected with M. lucifugus coronavirus and increase the potential of virus shedding.",

The amount of Myl-CoV RNA correlated with the severity of WNS pathology in co-infected bats. This phenomenon was associated with specific molecular responses to co-infection, even in the intestines of bats where only one of the two pathogens was directly interacting with the host tissue. The levels of antibodies against Myl-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein were also higher in co-infected bats. Each key result is discussed in detail below.",

There was no difference in the frequency of Myl-CoV detected among these treatments (p-value = 0.801). We pooled bats infected with the two P. destructans isolates for all further analyses and tested whether co-infection with P. destructans and Myl-CoV correlated with an increase in viral replication.

The severity of WNS fungal pathology varied in co-infected bats, and we therefore tested whether relative quantities of viral RNA in the ileum correlated with the severity of WNS symptoms. Levels of WNS severity were scored based on fungal hyphae on the wings, secondary bacteria in wing lesions, oedema, necrosis and inflammation in wing lesions, and levels of neutrophils in lung, spleen and liver interstitium. Severity scores for wing tissue, secondary bacteria in lesions, and neutrophils in the lung interstitium positively correlated with relative amounts of coronavirus RNA in hibernating bats (Table 1) .",

These differences in gene expression patterns included genes that clustered in two processes relevant to host-pathogen interactions -the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and cytokine and innate immune responses. Table 2 lists genes from the two processes that were significantly either up or down-regulated when virus-infected bats were compared to co-infected bats. For the MAPK pathway-related transcripts, genes such as RSU1 and RERG were up-regulated while those, such as STYK1, RRAD, MAP3K and SRC were down-regulated. For cytokine-related genes several transcripts were suppressed. When we compared the expression of the same genes for bats with WNS (combining fungus-infected and co-infected bats) and all bats without WNS (combining uninfected and virus-infected bats), we found similar differences (last two columns of Table 2 ). This suggested that superficial infection with fungus, P. destructans, was the driving factor for altered gene expression in the bat intestines. To confirm the results of the RNA-seq analysis, we selected 4 genes from Table 2 , namely IRF1, RERG, SRC and IL22RA1, to be verified by RT-qPCR. We also included interleukin 10 (IL10) due to its biological relevance to immune regulation and because we had previously observed an increase in its expression related to fungal infection 43 . As we wanted to confirm whether WNS was driving gene expression in the intestines of bats, we performed a two-group analysis for the RT-qPCR data. We combined all the bats without WNS into a single group (uninfected + virus-infected) and all the bats with WNS into the other group (fungus-infected + co-infected; Fig. 3 (A)). Expression of Ras-like estrogen regulated growth inhibitor (RERG) increased while expression of Interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 1 (IL22 RA1) genes decreased in bats with WNS, irrespective of viral infection (Fig. 3C,E) . Expression of the immune modulatory cytokine IL10 tended to be higher in bats with WNS than in bats without WNS, but the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.07) (Fig. 3(F) ).",

This is the first study to examine the systemic effects of co-infection on either bat coronavirus or WNS, and our results raise important questions in regard to zoonotic spillover events. Although events of successful viral spillover to distantly related species are thought to be extremely rare, in recent years several coronaviruses have spilled over, including SARS-CoV 1 , MERS-CoV 2-5 , PEDV-CoV 6 and SADS-CoV 7 . These viruses are thought to have originated in bats. In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses that parasitize other mammals may have originated in bats as well 46 . If so, then understanding host-pathogen interactions between bats and coronaviruses could inform our ability to predict or manage the risk of spillover. In this study, we showed that a coronavirus exhibits low activity in its natural host, M. lucifugus, but that co-infection with a fungus increases the quantity of viral RNA",

            "text": "We discovered that bats with WNS (fungus-infected and co-infected) had significantly lower intestinal levels of transcripts for IL22RA1 and other interferon-related genes as compared to uninfected bats, and we observed the same trend in IL10 (although it was not significant; p value = 0.07). IL22RA1 is the receptor present on host cells, including intestinal cells, which help in initiating cellular signalling in response to IL22 produced by T-cells 54 . IL-22 leads to an increase in anti-microbial peptide production, cellular protection against damage and increases cellular proliferation 55 . Therefore, reduced IL-22 signalling in the intestines of bats with WNS, might suppress the bat defences that control the coronavirus infection. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory gene, IL10, is expressed more in the lungs of bats with WNS than in bats without it 43 . We saw a similar trend with the levels of IL10 in the intestines which might play a role in suppressing the immune response against the coronavirus. Another altered cytokine gene which was of interest was the suppressor of cytokine signalling-6 (SOCS6) gene. Fungal-infected bats showed lower levels of SOCS6 transcripts, lack of which has been implicated in mild growth retardation in mice 56 . Overall, our results suggest that WNS triggers changes in gene expression in the ileum (Fig. 5) . These may influence expression of interferon-stimulated-genes (ISGs), thereby leading to increased viral replication at the site of viral persistence. Interferon-related transcripts were more highly expressed in the ileum of virus-infected bats that did not have WNS, suggesting that the bat's response to WNS causes down-regulation of interferon activity. Interferons may control coronavirus replication, as seen in cases of SARS-CoV 57 and MERS-CoV 58 . Therefore, a decrease in interferon activity might cause an increase in coronavirus (Myl-CoV) replication. In addition to interferon-related genes, we also found that RERG, which is related to growth inhibition, was upregulated in the fungus-infected bats when compared to virus-infected bats. Upregulation of RERG could affect the rate of cell proliferation in the intestines 59 . Finally, this cascade of responses is associated with increased severity of WNS symptoms. Bats with WNS experience a range of systemic disturbances including dehydration, hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis and fat depletion 40, 41 , neutrophil infiltration of the lung interstitium, and increased expression of transcripts related to anti-microbial and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines 43 . Taken together, this evidence suggests that hibernating bats respond systemically to superficial fungal infection, and this hypothesis is further supported by our observations of altered gene expression in the ileum of fungus-infected bats.",

The establishment of WNS (or other secondary infection) impacts the tissue with which that pathogen interacts (in the case of P. destructans, the skin). Direct interactions between the host and the secondary pathogen are limited to the affected tissue, but the systemic response to the disease triggers a cascade of immune responses, including increased release of cytokines or neutrophils. Affected cells such as intra-alveolar macrophages in the lungs or cells lining the intestine, may produce pro-or anti-inflammatory molecules and influence cells that harbour viral genomes. This cascade of host responses disrupts the equilibrium between the persistently infecting virus and the cell's innate immune response, leading to a dramatic increase in the expression of coronavirus (Myl-CoV) replication. Our assays were unfortunately limited to analysing viral and cytokine transcripts rather than protein, because reagents for detecting bat viral and host proteins are not yet available. We were not able to perform serial dilutions of the plasma to precisely quantify anti-viral titre due to the limitation in the amount of plasma obtained from each bat. The sample size was also small for this assay, because only 7 of the sampled bats had detectable levels of coronavirus in their intestines and were positive for viral antibodies. Despite these limitations, we demonstrated higher antibodies against the coronavirus in the plasma of co-infected bats when compared with virus-infected bats. This increased antibody level in co-infected bats might reflect an adaptive immune response to increased coronavirus replication in the intestines.",

Increased viral replication or viral load may affect the severity and population-level impacts of WNS. Bat mortality following the arrival of WNS varies widely from site to site, with populations decreasing from 30% to 99% 35 . Variation in the microclimate, and other ecological factors may drive some of this variation 60 , but our data suggest that cryptic viral infections may also play a role in determining survival rates for bats hibernating in sites colonized by P. destructans. We recommend that future studies on population-wide impact of WNS incorporate viral sampling to help better understand the role of co-infections on bat populations in the wild.",

Briefly, bats in groups of 18 were either sham-inoculated or inoculated with North American or European isolates of P. destructans. Bats were housed at 7 \u00b0C and >97% relative humidity with ad libitum water. All bats were equipped with data loggers to monitor skin temperatures.

Samples in RNAlater were kept at \u221220 \u00b0C until they were processed. North American and European isolates of P. destructans caused similar disease outcomes 37 , so we did not differentiate between the strains in subsequent analysis.

We targeted the ileum transcriptome because this is the tissue in which Myl-CoV is present in detectable concentrations 32 . Extraction of RNA from ileum tissue, which includes the ileum and potential gut contents have been described in previous sections. Bats were screened for Myl-CoV using RT-qPCR, and bats were assigned post hoc to treatment groups representing four infection histories ( Fig. 1(A) ): 1) Uninfected (bats were not infected with virus or fungus; n = 5), 2) Virus-infected (bats were na\u00efve to the fungus but had a persistent Myl-CoV infection; n = 4), 3) Fungus-infected (bats were experimentally infected with P. destructans and no virus was detected; n = 3), or 4) Co-infected (bats with persistent Myl-CoV infections that were also experimentally infected with P. destructans; n = 4). All samples had adequate RNA quality for sequencing (i.e. RIN value >7).",

The relative levels of a transcript for each bat were calculated as RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (Ct) normalized separately (\u0394Ct) to the \"house-keeping\" gene GAPDH. A \u0394Ct reduction of one (1) indicates an approximately two-fold higher concentration of RNA. The significance of differences of mean values of \u0394Ct between co-infected bats and virus-infected bats were determined using an independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test. We calculated Pearson's coefficients to test the correlation between \u0394Ct levels for coronavirus polymerase cDNA for bats in each treatment class, and average scores for fungal hyphae, secondary bacteria, oedema, necrosis and inflammation in wing lesions, as well as bacteremia and levels of neutrophils in lung, spleen and liver interstitium.",

Diagram summarizes the changes observed by comparing co-infected bats with virus-infected bats. Bats with persistent Myl-CoV infection exhibit relatively low viral shedding. When bats are also infected with P. destructans (shown in yellow arrow) and develop WNS, the level of coronavirus increases. There is a change in the level of some immune genes, such as IL22, RERG and possibly IL10, which may have an effect on immune response and cell proliferation. The increase in coronavirus levels in co-infected bats is possibly due to the bats' systemic response to WNS reducing innate anti-viral responses.
