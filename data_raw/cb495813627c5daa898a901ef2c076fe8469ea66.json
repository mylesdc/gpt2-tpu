The dominant viral pathogen from 2014 to 2017 was parainfluenza virus, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Based on the climate seasons determined by daily average temperature, the highest overall viral detection rate was detected in spring (22.0%, 52/236), followed by winter (13.4%, 109/813), autumn (11.4%, 13/114) and summer (10.9%, 15/137).

Overall, the viral detection rate was relatively lower in the chronic diseases group (11.7% vs. 16.9%), with statistical significance (p = 0.008).

            "text": "Adult populations with respiratory infections bear heavy burdens of hospitalization due to severe respiratory illness, especially for senior citizens (Muller-Pebody et al., 2006) . The constantly changing nature of viral pathogens has made the surveillance of these infections critical to public health authorities (Zou et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017) . The key indicators for viral infections from this report and recent published surveys in China has been summarized in Table 4 . The overall detection rate of viral infection among hospitalized adult patients in this report is 14.5%, which was consistent with the result of 16.8% in the age group above 14 years old by a national survey from 2009 to 2013 in China (Feng et al., 2014) . The dominant viral pathogen throughout this study period was PIV, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus. The national survey on hospitalized patients with respiratory infection in China from 2009 to 2013 showed that influenza virus had the highest detection rate of 8.0% in adult patients. The detection rate of respiratory viruses in the over 16 years age group was 24.2% in Shandong province of China (Liu et al., 2015) and was dominated by influenza virus (8.7%) from 2011 to 2013. From 2012 to 2015, the respiratory viral detection rate in hospitalized patients above 14 years old within Beijing and Shandong China was reported to be 38.9%, in which influenza virus had the highest frequency of 8.0% (Yu et al., 2018) . Compared with recent surveys in Beijing, Shandong and other regions in China, this report showed that the PIV dominated epidemic seasons from 2014 to 2017 in adult patients in Harbin, which should be important for preparing future epidemic control strategies in public health. The viral infection rate within asthma subgroup of this report was 5%, and it was one patient with RSV among 20 asthma patients in total as shown in Table 3 . Asthma is related to viral infection, while the detection rates varies among different pathogens. A recently published meta-analysis showed that the mean prevalence of RSV, influenza virus, PIV and ADV was 13.6%, 10%, 5.6%, and 3.8%, respectively (Zheng et al., 2018) . The apparently low detection rate within asthma group in this report could be possibly caused by the sampling bias due to the limited subgroup size. Air temperature was a major meteorological variable associated with respiratory viral infection (Chan et al., 2015) . Harbin city is located at 46 degrees north latitude with an annual average temperature of 4.9 degrees Celsius. Climate seasons are not in equal length in Harbin, according to historical statistics from 1981 to 2010. The longest season in Harbin is winter, which starts on the 4th of October and lasts 201 days, followed by spring on the 23rd of April with 61 days. Starting on the 23rd of June, summers in Harbin are relatively short at 53 days, while autumn is 50 days and is the shortest season, starting on the 15th of August. In routine epidemiological analysis, 12 months in a year were usually divided into four seasons equally, which is not the case in Harbin and possibly compromises contagious disease seasonality prediction. Based on climate seasons defined by the daily average air temperature, influenza, parainfluenza and RSV detected in this report all presented significant seasonal peaks in spring, although similar phenomena were absent within the calendar seasons.",

ADV strain GB was named VR-3 in the ATCC database, which was isolated from an adult patient with common cold in Maryland, United States in 1953 (Huebner et al., 1954) . The similarity of these strains across Asian and American continents through several decades may result from the globalization movement in modern China. It could also be explained by another hypothesis based on the evolution history of adenoviruses. On the geological scale, Homo sapiens inherit human adenoviruses from our ancestors within the Hominidae, resulting in an evolutionary rate of human ADV as low as 2.8E-8 substitution per site per year (Hoppe et al., 2015) . Considering its 36 kbp genome, we would have to wait a millennium (or 992 years exactly) before a single site mutation within an adenoviral genome occurred naturally.",
