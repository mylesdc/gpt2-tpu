These protocols allow for in vitro amplification of specific gene, thus enabling an accurate diagnosis of clinical isolates from patients. Indeed, a sensitive molecular detection for MERS-CoV was achieved by using the upstream of the envelope E (upE) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a (Memish et al., 2014; Shirato et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, according to the 2013 WHO announcement for MERS-CoV positive detection 2 , it is still necessary to develop as many specific genetic targets as possible, to allow reliable MERS-CoV diagnoses.",

LAMP has especially attracted considerable interest since it is a potentially comparable to the popular detection methods such as conventional PCR and real-time PCR, in terms of specificity and sensitivity. For example, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria genome markers have been used for the LAMP-based amplification assay (Aoi et al., 2006; Arunrut et al., 2016) . LAMP protocol can also be applied for the detection of RNA viruses, including the SARS corona virus (Hong et al., 2004) , influenza viruses (Poon et al., 2005) , and other infectious respiratory viruses, by merging the reverse transcription steps into the LAMP processes (Parida et al., 2005) . To date, RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of MERS-CoV RNA, targets within the ORF 1a and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene (Bhadra et al., 2015) . The researchers are able to improve their RT-LAMP by monitoring the real-time fluorescent signal using the labscale PCR machine, but are still limited by the need for gel electrophoresis imaging system, expensive thermal cyclers, and the time-consuming technique.",

Two additional loop primers (LF and LB) were used to enhance the LAMP reaction. The standardized dsDNA (1 ng/\u00b5L of MERS-CoV viral N gene) was used. The sequences of the primers and their locations are indicated in Figure 2B , and Table 1 . According to the previous study of LAMP assays (Kuboki et al., 2003; Parida et al., 2008) , typical thymine spacers were used to enhance LAMP efficiency by assisting the loop formation. Hwang et al. (Yang et al., 2010) investigated the effects of LAMP amplification associated by inserting T-bases into the FIP and BIP, which suggested that the LAMP primer containing T4 linker sequences would be greater than the conventional PCR method. However, in our experiment, the T4 linker didn't seem to affect gene amplification, and its use was rather a failure in LAMP reaction. Supplementary Figure  S2 shows the experimental results for the LAMP amplification depending on the primer configurations (P1, P1-T4, P2, and P2-T4). The experimental verification of the LAMP primer performance was critical for the successful amplification. Agarose gel electrophoresis and SYBR green I visible evidence (UV on/off) show that the P1 primer compositions contain the typical LAMP signature, as shown in Figure 2C . Moreover, there is only one mismatch in the essential F2, B2, and B3 regions, compared to the individual sequences of the other MERS-CoV (Figure 2A) . Thus, the Primer 1 set (P1) was selected for further investigations. We believe that the LAMP primer set utilized in this study is available to detect MERS-CoV N gene as a universal element in LAMP assay.",

The positive reaction was clearly observed in the 4 RNA copies of MERS-CoV RNA sample in the optimized RT-LAMP reaction, using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, UV and naked eye (Figures 4A,B) .

Significantly, with RT-LAMP, it was possible to detect the presence of viral RNA genome without a requirement for a reverse transcription step [total reaction time for RT-LAMP: 60 min, Figure 3B ].

All signal read-outs were distinguished after amplification between positive and negative results in end-point analysis by adding 2 \u00b5L of SYBR-green I dye to the LAMP reactants. Although the SYBR-green I based end-point signal read-out is more robust and effective than the fluorescent and naked-eye LAMP detection, the difficulty exists in applying in one-pot analysis, since the highly concentrated SYBR-green I dye is a strong inhibitor of DNA polymerase activity during the thermal cycling process. In order to study the effect of the SYBR-green concentration on one-pot RT-LAMP reaction, different concentrations were introduced into the mixture prior to the RT-LAMP amplification. As presented in Supplementary Figure S5 , the electrophoresis gel data clearly confirm that successful RT-LAMP amplification achieved in the range 0 \u223c 50X concentrated SYBR-green. However, as expected, we found that the fluorescent SYBR-green I signal observed in the highly concentrated solutions (100 \u223c 1000X) failed to represent any significant correlation between the LAMP-amplification and positive response. Even the signal difference between positive and negative samples was not obvious at maximum SYBR-green I concentration (50X, not inhibited to LAMP amplification). This suggests that an alternative detection method should be adopted to realize the one-pot RT-LAMP reaction.",

In addition, end-point detection for observing LAMP signals requires opening of the reaction tube caps; this is problematic when employing to large-scale screening and on-site field application. In this study, the one-pot RT-LAMP assay for detection of MERS-CoV was designed using EvaGreen modified microchamber method for visualizing the resultant signal. SYBR-green and EvaGreen are well known DNA-intercalating dyes for PCR. However, as shown in Figure 5 , EvaGreen was more suitable to LAMP monitoring because it did not significantly affect to Bst DNA polymerization, and therefore it was acceptable to be present throughout the entire one-pot RT-LAMP reaction.",

Our experiments conducted with the microchamber demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity comparable to the benchtop PCR results. After loading the one-pot RT-LAMP mixture into a single unit of microchamber, the reaction was performed for 60 min, using a basic water-bath. Finally, the onepot RT-LAMP in a microchamber displayed sufficient product sensitivity and specificity, which were useful to distinguish between MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses, such as 229E, MPV, Influenza type B (Yamagata lineage), Influenza type B (Victoria lineage), Influenza type A-H1N1 and Influenza type A-H3N2.
