However, patterns of person-to-person contact relevant to the spread of directly transmitted infections such as influenza remain poorly quantified in the region. We conducted a household-based survey of travel and contact patterns among urban and rural populations of Guangdong, China. We measured the character and distance from home of social encounters made by 1821 individuals. Most individuals reported 5-10 h of contact with around 10 individuals each day; however, both distributions have long tails. The distribution of distance from home at which contacts were made is similar: most were within a kilometre of the participant's home, while some occurred further than 500 km away. Compared with younger individuals, older individuals made fewer contacts which tended to be closer to home. There was strong assortativity in age-based contact rates. We found no difference between the total number or duration of contacts between urban and rural participants, but urban participants tended to make contacts closer to home. These results can improve mathematical models of infectious disease emergence, spread and control in southern China and throughout the region.",

            "text": "For many respiratory infections, spread is thought to occur predominantly through close person-to-person contact [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] There has been considerable interest in quantifying these interactions, particularly in understanding how different age groups mix and the extent to which mixing is assortative by age [6] . This interest has been driven by the role human contact patterns play in determining the effectiveness of vaccination and social distancing measures, and in the ability of mathematical models to predict the course of epidemics and the effectiveness of interventions [7] . However, empirical studies of social mixing specifically targeted at understanding the spread of respiratory infections have been restricted to European countries [6, 8] , the USA [9] , Vietnam [10] and Taiwan [11] . These studies have measured the distribution of number of daily contacts, the proportion of contacts made within various social and environmental settings, as well as other properties of contacts thought to be important for direct transmission of infectious disease, such as duration and frequency of encounter, and whether the contact included touch or not. There is evidence that these self-reported contacts are relevant to the transmission patterns of acute respiratory infections, such as mumps, influenza, chickenpox and parvovirus [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . While useful in its own right, studies thus far have not captured spatial aspects of social contact processes including spatial dispersal and heterogeneity, which may be useful in understanding the dynamics of contagion. Differences between urban and rural populations may be particularly important for the emergence and initial spread of zoonotic pathogens, as animal densities are generally higher in rural areas and urban locations tend to serve as hubs for global spread [17] . Spatial information on social contacts can increase our understanding of how acute respiratory infectious diseases spread regionally and provide an empirical foundation for models of the emergence, spread and control of novel pathogens of zoonotic origin, such as human-adapted avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Communities were divided into four categories based on the log of local population density: (i) low density-more than 1 s.d. below the mean, (ii) low-mid density-below the mean by less than 1 s.d., (iii) high-mid density-above the mean by less than 1 s.d., and (iv) high density-more than 1 s.d. above the mean.",

Contact surveys took the form of interviewer led questionnaires in which study participants report all the people they encountered the previous day (from waking to going to bed) with whom they had a face-to-face conversation or skin-on-skin touch; these types of contact are useful proxies for transmission opportunities [12 -16] . We define a contact event as an event where contacts are reported, either as an encounter with an individual or a group, and count each individual contacted in such an event as a 'contact'; hence, an participant's total number of contacts is the number of individuals reported across all contact events. However, we cannot determine whether all individuals are unique across contact events, and sometimes the same individual may appear in multiple events reported by a participant. Hence, the number of contacts reported should be considered a measure of the number of transmission opportunities that occurred through contact involving face-to-face interaction or touch, not necessarily the number of unique individuals who had the opportunity to infect (or be infected by) the study participant. To facilitate the reporting of high numbers of contacts, participants could report groups of similarly encountered individuals as a single event involving multiple people, rather than reporting each contact individually. This was to facilitate the recording of contact with large numbers of individuals and measure the right-hand tail of degree distributions with greater precision. Previous versions of contact diaries with single line entry for each contact (e.g. [6] ) possibly suffer from the underreporting of contacts [8] .There was no limit to the number of contacts (or contact events) that could be reported, and participants were not aware of how many slots for reporting were available on the questionnaire.",

[8] , we assigned contact durations (an integer number of minutes; multiplying by the number of individuals if the event was with a group) following an exponential distribution to each contact event. We summed the duration of each reported contact event to find the total duration of all contacts for each participant. We estimated the distribution of contact time using an adaptation of the expectationmaximization algorithm to fit the exponential model. The actual duration of a contact event was considered to be within the reported range, or one of the two adjacent categories (for example, if an individual reported 10 -29 min, the actual duration was considered to be between 0 and 59 min). Contacts were initially assigned a random duration within this interval based on an exponential distribution. This distribution was then re-estimated based on these times, and random contact times were reselected. This process was repeated until the distribution converged. In analyses, 100 parametric bootstrap iterations were performed in which contact times were randomly assigned in the same manner.",

However, some important differences were apparent. While European studies found that schoolage children have the highest rates of contact [6] , we found little difference by age group, except for a decreased number of contacts made by those older than 70 years. However, when we considered the total duration of contacts made, we found a steady decline with increasing age, a feature also present in European study data [6] , though previously unreported (see the electronic supplementary material). From an epidemiological perspective, such contact patterns may be relevant to the transmission and control of influenza and other acute respiratory infections [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Although total contact number determines the potential frequency of exposure to infections, the risk of infection may depend more strongly on contact duration [4, 8] . Modification of infection risk by time, not just frequency, of contact could be an important enhancement to models of infectious disease transmission. Age-assortativity can have a fundamental impact on patterns of infection, and it has been suggested that these patterns could inform the targeting of control measures [16, 26] . Age-assortativity in our population follows a similar pattern to that found in Europe and Vietnam [6, 10] . We found age-assortativity to increase the further contacts were made from home. This may be explained by considering why individuals may travel different distances from home; our findings suggest contact with smaller, similarly aged groups of other individuals occur more often far from home. This is consistent with the finding that clustering of transitive links between contacts has been found to increase with distance from home in a UK-based study [8] . These results suggest the location of contact events and the age distribution of contacts are not independent and may need to be modelled jointly to appropriately capture transmission dynamics.",

The most mobile adult age group, those aged between 20 and 29 years, also had high rates of contact in terms of both number and duration: this age group may be expected to play an important role in the geographical spread of closecontact infections and may be an important age group to target for the containment and control of emerging infections.",

While this reduction is in part explained by a higher prevalence of older individuals in these locations, it may also be evidence of 'urban isolation' [27] in a rapidly developing region of China. There is also the possibility this reflects a sampling bias, as most urban contacts happen outside of the home, hence the most social individuals may be harder to capture in our study (because they are frequently absent from home). The most marked rural-urban differences are found in the locations in which contacts occur, with more contacts occurring within the home in rural areas, but contacts made outside of the home occurring further from the home. This is in contrast to a previous study of travel patterns in a different province of China [28] which found rural populations stayed significantly closer to home than more urban populations. The frequency of more distant contacts among those living in rural communities (2% are 25 km or further from home) suggest that an emerging pathogen arising in a rural population will have numerous opportunities to make long distance jumps, and that containment may be difficult.",

The locations of contacts made far from home were measured with less spatial resolution than those made within the home or immediate neighbourhood (e.g. a contact made in a different province would be assigned to the centre of the town or city where that contact occurred). The age categories used here are coarse and differentially sized; hence, some measures of contact (e.g. the raw number in each group) might be biased towards assortativity. We address this concern by use of China national census data and calculation of relative contact frequencies compared to the expectation, given the size of the age categories. If the local population is not reflected by the population reported in the census, then this may bias our results; however, our study population is a good match to the census data, suggesting any such bias is likely to be small (see the rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 281: 20140268 electronic supplementary material). Allowing for the reporting of contacts in groups allowed us to avoid apparent truncation issues seen in other studies [6, 8] , but also made it difficult to determine how many unique individuals were encountered during the day and may have inflated the number of contacts reported. The duration of contact was also reported relatively coarsely, requiring a parametric approach to estimate total contact duration. There are some limitations regarding the day and dates of contact diaries collected. Participants were recruited and interviewed throughout the year, though relatively few interviews were conducted during February owing to holidays associated with Chinese New Year. Also, as a consequence of normal working practices, we collected fewer contact diaries about Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays than the other days of the week.",

The results show that the patterns seen when only examining numbers of contacts may differ from those seen when considering the duration of contact, though broad trends remain similar. Researchers should carefully consider which factor, duration or number, is more important in disease transmission when incorporating contact patterns into their models. This study directly relates contact patterns of individuals to measures of urbanization (here population density and official designation). We find little difference in the number and duration of contacts, or the age-mixing patterns, between these populations, but we do find substantial differences in the spatial distribution of contacts. Our results suggest that measurable social contacts occur in similar numbers regardless of urbanization if locations share a cultural context; hence, observed differences in disease incidence between urban and rural locations [29, 30] may be better explained by other factors: travel patterns, the structural properties of full contact networks or incidental contacts not easily measured or observed.",
