Piglets (n = 62) derived from 6 sows were assigned to one of 6 different treatments using a randomized block design which provided for allocation of all treatments to all sows' litters. Each treatment was designed to achieve a different level of circulating anti-PEDV antibody via intraperitoneally administration of concentrated serum antibody. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV (USA/IN/2013/19338E, 1 x 10 3 TCID 50 per piglet) 24 hours later and then monitored for 14 days. Piglets remained with their dam throughout the experiment. Sow milk samples, piglet fecal samples, and data on piglet clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature were collected daily. Fecal samples were tested by PEDV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Serum, colostrum, and milk were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virusneutralizing antibody. The data were evaluated for the effects of systemic PEDV antibody levels on growth, body temperature, fecal shedding, survival, and antibody response. The analysis showed that circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of PEDV infection. Specifically, antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster and demonstrated a higher rate of survivability than piglets without PEDV antibody. When combined with previous literature on PEDV, it can be concluded that both systemic antibodies and maternal secretory IgA in milk contribute to the protection of the neonatal pig against PEDV infections. Overall, the results of this experiment suggested that passively administered circulating antibodies contributed to the protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV infection.",

Specifically, swine serum proteins and serum antibody (IgG and IgA) were precipitated by single fractional precipitation using 30% and then 40% ammonium sulfate, respectively. The entire process was conducted in an environmental chamber (Caron 1 , Marietta, OH) maintained at 4\u00b0C. Initially, 2 PEDV naturally (field) exposed sows were acquired from a commercial swine farm. Testing of the pooled sow serum, before antibody purification and concentration, by PEDV WV ELISA resulted in S/P ratios of 5.0 for IgA and 2.6 for IgG. The 2 sows were humanely euthanized and exsanguinated to collect whole blood (ISU #2-14-7736-S). Serum was harvested, and stored in 1 L bottles (Biotainer\u2122, Nalge Nunc Corp., Rochester, NY) at -20\u00b0C. For the first precipitation, the serum was thawed for 24 h at 4\u00b0C, the volume of saturated ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) calculated to achieve 30% concentration was added in a drop-by-drop fashion while stirring continuously, and then the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 16 h with continued stirring. Following incubation, the mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0C) at 4,000 x g for 10 min to remove protein aggregates and less soluble proteins. For the second precipitation, the volume of the supernatant (IgM-free antibody fraction) was measured, additional saturated ammonium sulfate was added as before to achieve a final concentration of 40%, and then the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4\u00b0C with stirring. Thereafter, the mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0C) at 4,000 x g for 10 min to recover the antibody fraction. The pelleted antibody was gently resuspended with PBS (1X pH 7.4) at a 1:5 (pellet:PBS) volume ratio. To remove salts, the solution was dialyzed in 250 ml dialysis flasks (Pierce 1 , Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, CA) floating vertically in~15 liters of 4\u00b0C, continuously stirred PBS (1X pH 7.4). The entire volume of PBS was replaced every 4 h for 5 times and then the antibody solution was concentrated by polyacrylamide gel dialysis (Spectra/Gel 1 Absorbent, Spectrum Laboratories, Inc. Rancho Dominguez, CA). The PEDV WV ELISA S/P ratios of the concentrated antibody solution were 3.0 for IgG, and 7.2 for IgA. The concentrated antibody solution was then aliquoted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C until used.",

Physiologically, this approach relied on the fact that antibodies injected into the peritoneum are quickly taken up by the lymphatic system and enter the circulatory system via the vena cava [36] . Essentially, intraperitoneal injection gives the same bioavailability as intravenous injection. Thus, it was possible to produce different levels of circulating PEDV antibody by intraperitoneal inoculation with specific levels of concentrated PEDV antibody solution ( Table 2) . The passive antibody model has previously been used to study maternally-derived humoral immunity in mice [37] [38] [39] , rats [40] , and hamsters [41] . In swine, this method was previously used to study the effect of passive antibody on rotavirus infection [42] [43] [44] [45] and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [46] [47] . Hodgins et al. (1999) found that passive antibody provided protection against clinical rotaviral infection, but also suppressed the piglets' active immune responses [42] . reported that passive antibody protected neonates against rotavirus and determined that high titers of maternal antibody suppressed effector and memory B-cell responses [43] . Other workers found that intraperitoneal injection of PRRSV antibody sufficient to achieve serum neutralizing antibody titers of ! 1:16 inhibited PRRSV replication in 2 -to 5-week-old pigs [46] [47] .

A similar pattern was observed under the conditions of this experiment. Diarrhea was first observed at one DPI, all fecal samples were PEDV rRT-PCR positive on DPI 2, and mortality commenced on DPI 2. Statistical analyses found that circulating PEDV antibody did not protect piglets from the negative effects of PEDV on growth, reduce or eliminate shedding of PEDV in feces, or affect the humoral immune response against PEDV infection. However, circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of PEDV infection on body temperature and improved piglet survivability. Specifically, antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster (Fig 2b) and demonstrated higher survivability than PEDV antibody-negative control piglets (Fig 2c) . These results are compatible with previous reports for swine coronaviruses. Shibata et al. (2001) reported that passive PEDV-specific antibody was effective in preventing PEDV infection and reduced mortality in 2 day-old piglets [51] . Stepanek et al. (1982) demonstrated that the presence of sufficient levels of TGEV-specific passive antibody delayed mortality due to TGEV infection in 4 day-old pigs [52] . The mechanisms responsible for producing these results have not been established, but we hypothesize that one or more of the following four mechanisms may be involved:",

There are no reports on PEDV with which these results can be compared, but the results would be consistent with a previous report by Lopez et al.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effected by interactions between antibody and other components of the immune system, e.g. complement, phagocytic cells, and natural killer cells, could have expedited cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) against PEDV [56] . ADCC kills antibody-coated infected cells by inducing the expression of cell death-inducing molecules [57] . Presumably, this mechanism is effective for any PEDVinfected cells; not only enterocytes. Madson et al. (2015) has reported that, in addition to enterocytes, cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen may stain positive for PEDV by immunohistochemistry [17] .",

Passively-transferred, circulating PEDV IgG could have passed directly from capillaries into the small intestine by paracellular leakage and neonatal Fc receptors [42, 45, 58] . If so, the transported IgG may have neutralized PEDV in the intestinal lumen and/or assisted the humoral and CMI responses by facilitating uptake of PEDV antigen through receptors on apical surfaces of microfold cells [58] [59] . Again, there is no PEDV research against which to test this hypothesis, but IgG is known to play an important role against parvovirus infection in crypt cells [60] . Evidence against this hypothesis is the fact that IgA is believed to play a primary role in protecting against enteric viruses that infect villous enterocytes, e.g. TGEV and rotavirus [61] , and PEDV primarily infects villous enterocytes [17] .",

How do the antibody levels and antibody isotypes examined in this experiment relate to those achieved in production settings by feedback, vaccination, or a combination of the two? Regardless, it is clear that the optimal protection to piglets will be provided by dams able to deliver both high antibody titers in colostrum and high titers of secretory IgA in milk. ",
