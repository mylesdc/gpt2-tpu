Dengue is now endemic in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is at risk for Zika, another emerging arbovirus. The interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors that affect dengue and other arboviruses' transmission is understudied. Design. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors on dengue transmission in Puerto Rico and to draw lessons for Zika response. Results. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journal articles was performed, producing 562 articles; 26 were selected for this review. Findings indicate that human activities and behaviors (urbanization, migration, and consumption) as well as climate have a significant impact on the abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti, the vector for dengue, Zika, and other viruses. Conclusion. Despite the public health burden of dengue limited investments have been made in research and surveillance. Future research is needed to develop models that integrate the multivariate effects of climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors, which for Puerto Rico have mostly been examined independently. Such models have the potential to inform response to dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses.",

The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes [2] . The mosquito has four distinct stages in its life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The duration of the larval stages is 7-9 days at 25 \u2218 C and that of the pupal stages is 2-3 days at the same temperature [8] .

The disease surveillance system in Puerto Rico comprises primarily passive and some active surveillance activities [14] . The Dengue Branch of the CDC is located in San Juan and is responsible for the islandwide laboratory-based passive dengue surveillance system (PDSS) in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) [18] . The active surveillance system includes diagnostic testing and submission of serum samples accompanied by a Dengue Case Investigation Report (DCIR) from suspected dengue case-patients to the CDC Dengue Branch Laboratories [18] . DF and DHF reporting is mandated by law in Puerto Rico [18] .",

It also puts severe constraints on civic amenities, particularly water supply and solid waste disposal, thereby increasing the breeding potential of the vector species [4, 9] . Water that is left stored in the open can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry dengue fever [19] . Risk factors associated with dengue also include lacking mosquito control infrastructure and dengue vector control services [20] . In addition, increased air travel and globalization of trade significantly contributed to the introduction of all dengue virus serotypes to most population centers of the world. Globalization and travel have also contributed to hyperendemic transmission of all four dengue serotypes throughout the tropics [21] .",

Ten studies (38.5%) satisfied 80% or more of the applicable criteria (range 80%-93%), achieving a score of five and a \"high\" rating (see Table 1 ). Though none of the 26 studies satisfied 100% of applicable Fink criteria, all studies [25] . This positive association varied spatially and was associated with differences in local climate. For example, the effect of temperature on dengue incidence was highest in Puerto Rico's cool and wet mountainous area, while the effect of precipitation was greatest in the hot and dry southwestern coastal region. Likewise, M\u00e9ndez-L\u00e1zaro et al. (2014) found that dengue transmission increased by a factor of 3.4 for each 1 \u2218 C increase in sea surface temperature. In contrast, Jury (2008) found that monthly increases in dengue cases were driven by rainfall (May to November) while intra-annual variability in dengue cases related positively to temperature. Jury also found that the incidence of dengue had been relatively constant over time, despite global warming, which was possibly due to declining rainfall after 1998, improving health care and small changes in population size. He also found a weak association between year-to-year variability in dengue cases and local rainfall and an Index of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [48] . Keating (2001) considered the relationship between temperature and dengue incidence. Keating (2001) found a positive association between short-term interannual (monthly) variations in temperature and dengue incidence (as the temperature increases so does the number of dengue cases reported each month in Puerto Rico) [49] . Two studies also considered the effect of interannual climate variations (ENSO) on dengue incidence [48, 51] . Jury found that intra-annual variability in dengue cases was only weakly associated with ENSO [48] . Rigau-P\u00e9rez et al. found no positive relationship between the increase in dengue transmission and hurricanes and floods in 1995 and 1996, respectively [51] . He also found no significant correlation between increased transmission and rationed water supply and closed local landfills. Another study predicted that declining rainfall, improving health care, and limited population growth offset adverse effects of global warming [48] . A consideration of the potential mediating or constraining influence of nonclimatic factors of dengue transmission (socioeconomic factors) by Johansson et al. (2009) revealed that the association between weather variables and dengue incidence was stronger in areas with a higher poverty index [25] . Keating (2001) found that factors other than climate might be contributing to seasonal dengue incidence in Puerto Rico, such as predatorprey relationships, herd immunity, demographic changes, precipitation, and socioeconomic fluctuations [49] .",

It is important to note that this study was the first study of aquatic habitats producing dengue vectors anywhere in the Caribbean region or in Central and South America; the findings were unexpected because Ae. aegypti had been regarded as a \"clean water\" mosquito. Burke et al. (2010) also found a positive association between the number of mosquitoes and the conditions of septic tanks (cracked, uncapped openings, and septic water pH) in the dry season [54] .",

There was no significant relationship between temporal changes in mosquito production and rainfall. He also reported that Ae. aegypti adults emerging from septic tanks were significantly larger (3 to 9 times) than those emerging from surface water.

Of the articles discussing environmental factors, three considered entomologic surveillance and dengue vector control measures [58] [59] [60] . As mentioned earlier, pupal production is an indicator of vector abundance and density (vector density is the number of pupae per person). When vector density is considered high (all things being equal), the likelihood of an epidemic increases. Barrera et al. [59] found that sequential sampling provided substantial reductions in the sample size required to determine if vector density falls above or below a given threshold. For example, he found that, after sampling only 25 premises in the first survey and 125 in the second survey, it was possible to determine that pupae densities were above the dengue epidemic threshold (female pupae/person of 0.19) [59] . That study also examined the use of predictive computer models for validating threshold limits for epidemic risk in a particular locale [59] . He confirmed that simplified pupal surveys of Ae. aegypti (using sequential sampling programs) are an efficient method for validating entomological dengue transmission thresholds indicating when transmission might occur and thus forecasting epidemics [47] . Entomologic thresholds were based on mosquito simulation model and a dengue simulation model [59] . One study found that cost effective larval control programs are less than US$ 2.50 per person and reduce dengue transmission by 50%. Larval control programs in conjunction with an early warning system that provides information on possible outbreak of dengue are cost effective if below US$ 4.50 per person [60] (see Table 3 ).",

Two studies evaluated the island's laboratory-based, enhanced dengue surveillance system (EDSS), which was developed by the CDC and first implemented in Puerto Rico in 2005 [63, 66] . Ramos et al. (2008) concluded that the island's enhanced surveillance system allowed for a more accurate, populationbased estimate of dengue incidence and severity [64] . She also found that simplified case definitions for DHF based on WHO criteria might be useful for clinic-based surveillance. In addition, she postulated that early identification of dengue cases could be useful in reducing virus transmission in dengue endemic communities. Both Rigau-P\u00e9rez and Ramos stressed the importance of virologic surveillance in confirming the accuracy of dengue diagnosis [64, 66] (see Table 3 ).",

Seasonal rainfall enhances mosquito breeding and therefore vector abundance in areas where outdoor rain-filled surface containers are being used [58] and discarded containers, those used for animal drinking, ornamental purposes, and household cleaning filled with standing water were the most common oviposition sites.

The implications of these findings are significant as they suggest that the mosquito vector has adapted well to a multitude of urban habitats and environments and suggest that there may be other previously unknown breeding/oviposition sites. The wealth of research on environmental factors (social and cultural) affecting dengue emergence and disease emergence in Puerto Rico reflects the relative strength of Puerto Rico's dengue prevention and control services. Two studies reported on the effectiveness of epidemiologic and entomologic disease surveillance programs administered under the auspices of the PRDOH and the CDC [64, 66] .

Several emerging diseases have faced the same communication problems including Ebola, MERS-CoV, and now Zika. Health communication campaigns are often poorly resourced, rarely engage health communication experts from the affected area, and seldom benefit from meaningful evaluation. Despite this, community-based interventions remain to be critical to achieve long-term vector control through behavior change [61, 65] and public health interventions should address existing barriers to behavior which are deeply entrenched in the local culture's belief about health as well as gender roles and promote the integration of community groups and community leaders into current dengue prevention and control programs [17, 56] .",

First, although source reduction programs targeting the most productive surface container habitats remain an essential component of dengue prevention and control [61] , interventions should address structural problems that increase mosquito populations. Infrastructure investments should be used to convert homes from open sewage (ST) to sewer use [16, 55, 56] and to provide access to safe and a reliable water supply [17] . Though substantial, such investments would have a major impact on vector ecology and reduce the health burdens caused by dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and other emerging viruses. In addition to health gains, these investments would also help alleviate some of the existing structural poverty on the island.",

Other factors, such as intrinsic factors pertaining to human immunity and the dengue virus (infection parity, passively acquired antibodies, enhancing antibodies, absence of protective antibodies, viral strain, age, sex, race, nutritional status, and preceding host conditions), are important to consider in future studies. Second, there is an inherent risk of bias in the studies included in this review since only peer-reviewed studies were included (reporting bias). Third, there is also an inherit level of simplicity (relatively speaking) in the studies included as they investigated only one or two variables. Many of the included studies are limited by their design (ecological bias).",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this review indicates that extrinsic climatic, ecological, and environmental factors have an effect on dengue emergence and transmission in Puerto Rico. Changes in ecological factors, such as the vector utilizing alternative habitats such as septic tanks, and changes in human land use (urbanization) and vegetation provide new oviposition sites and feeding opportunities, allowing the vector to survive and increase its transmission potential. Social and cultural factors such as disease surveillance, community knowledge and behaviors (KAP), and social organization (gender role behaviors) play an important role in affecting vector control. These and other extrinsic factors do not act in isolation, but rather affect dengue transmission directly, indirectly, and in combination. Future research needs to further refine models in dengue transmission and include additional extrinsic factors such as demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic in order to understand further how they affect dengue transmission on a local level and over time. The problem of dengue, and now of Zika, transmission can change only if the vector can be controlled. However, for Puerto Rico, and in the context of global warming and increasing population growth and diversity, extrinsic factors are likely to remain influential well into the future.",

PR is characterized by a tropical climate with an average annual temperature of 25 \u2218 C. The dry season typically lasts fromDecember to April and the wet season (hot and rainy) runs from May to November. Hurricanes, high rainfall, landslides, and droughts have been major natural disturbances on the island.
