            "text": "Although members of the Flaviviridae display high incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates, the development of specific antiviral drugs for each virus is unlikely. Cyclophilins, a family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), play a pivotal role in the life cycles of many viruses and therefore represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral development. We report here the pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of a small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor (SMCypI). Mechanistic and modeling studies revealed that the SMCypI bound to cyclophilin A in competition with cyclosporine (CsA), inhibited its PPIase activity, and disrupted the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction. Resistance selection showed that the lead SMCypI hardly selected amino acid substitutions conferring low-level or no resistance in vitro. Interestingly, the SMCypI selected D320E and Y321H substitutions, located in domain II of the NS5A protein. These substitutions were previously associated with low-level resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir. Finally, the SMCypI inhibited the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family with higher 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 s) than for HCV. Thus, because of its chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with the potential for broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in viral life cycles.",

Among the HTAs, nonimmunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine (CsA) that target host cyclophilins (Cyps) yielded the most promising results. Alisporivir (ALV) was the first HTA to enter HCV clinical development and reach phase III clinical trials (5, 6) . Its development was halted following the report of seven cases of acute pancreatitis, including a lethal one (7) . These events were independent from Cyp inhibition, most likely due to ALV-induced hypertriglyceridemia that potentiated the pancreatic toxicity of interferon alpha that was part of the combination regimens. Although the cyclophilin inhibitors (CypIs) failed to reach the market for the indication of hepatitis C treatment, they remain attractive to combat other viral infections (8) (9) (10) (11) . Indeed, CypIs have been reported to be involved in the life cycles of viruses other than HCV (12) while having a high barrier to resistance, broad antiviral activity, and possibly additive or synergistic effects with other antiviral compounds in various models.",

The molecular mechanisms of the anti-HCV activity of CypIs are not yet fully understood.

Each of the 8 amino acid substitutions selected was introduced into a WT transient genotype 1b HCV-SGR for phenotypic analysis (compound susceptibility and replication capacity) in the presence of C31, ALV, and CsA (Table 2) . Among them, only the D320E and Y321H mutations were associated with a mild increase in the C31 EC 50 (\u03f32-to 5-fold), without an impairment of the replicon replication capacity.

Although ALV has been shown to potently inhibit HCV replication, its ability to block the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family is unknown. The immunosuppressive agent CsA has been reported to bear antiviral activity against DENV-2, WNV, and YFV (15), with less potency against WNV. Results regarding the susceptibility of ZIKV to CsA are limited and contradictory (24) . This sparseness of data prompted us to assess the anti-Flaviviridae activity of our new SMCypI. Here, we showed that C31, a SMCypI inhibitor of PPIase activity with anti-HCV activity in vitro, also inhibits the replication of several members of the Flaviviridae family in cell culture models. C31 was most effective against HCV and DENV replication, with EC 50s in the low-micromolar range. C31 inhibited YFV and ZIKV replication to a lesser extent, with EC 50s in the micromolar range. Although the EC 50 was above 50 M, the highest concentration tested, a trend toward a decrease of viral replication was also observed with WNV (data not shown). In contrast, no effect of C31 against JEV replication has been observed in our experiments (data not shown). To our knowledge, C31 is the first SMCypI with the potential for broad anti-Flaviviridae activity. Given the chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis of this new family of SMCypIs, a large number of new compounds will be synthesized in the future. It is thus likely that C31 derivatives with greater effectiveness against different members of the Flaviviridae family will be generated.",

Using several SMCypI derivatives with different potencies of inhibition of PPIase catalytic activity, we showed that the antiviral activity of the SMCypIs strongly correlates with their PPIase-inhibitory potency, confirming that Cyp PPIase activity is required for HCV replication. It was shown previously that CypA interacts directly with the HCV NS5A protein to regulate key processes of the HCV life cycle (17, 28, 30) . Disruption of this key interaction by CsA or ALV impairs HCV replication, possibly explaining the anti-HCV effect of these compounds (27, 31) . Whether similar mechanisms could be involved with other families of Cyp inhibitors remained unknown. We showed that the NS5A-CypA interaction was disrupted by C31. We also modeled the CypA binding modes of C31 and CsA. As expected, their superimposition suggested that both compounds shared a partially overlapping binding site. This result was confirmed by means of a TR-FRET assay, which showed that C31 displaces CsA from the CypA catalytic site. Interestingly, we also observed that the aniline moiety of C31 was deeply buried in a pocket contiguous to the canonical catalytic site, the gatekeeper pocket, which is out of reach for CsA, suggesting that the modes of inhibition of CsA and SMCypIs may partially differ. This could explain why CsA and ALV did not inhibit ZIKV replication in this study, whereas C31 did, possibly through a PPIase-independent mechanism different from that involved in HCV inhibition (data not shown).",
