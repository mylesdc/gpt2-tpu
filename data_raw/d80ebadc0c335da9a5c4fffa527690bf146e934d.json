Timely diagnosis also plays a crucial role in avoiding inappropriate use of antibiotics, thereby lowering the risk of antimicrobial resistance [9] . Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), especially reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are increasingly used to detect RSV because they are more sensitive than rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) [10] . Despite the superior sensitivity of RT-PCR over RADTs, RADTs remain an important diagnostic tool, especially in point-of-care settings, due to their shorter turnaround time and ease of use [11, 12] . Conversely, specialised training and sophisticated and costly instrumentation are required to perform RT-PCR. Consequently, the method is often confined to specialised and large central laboratories.",

To reduce the diagnostic time, we developed an isothermal reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA) assay for the detection of RSV. In RT-SIBA reactions, RSV RNA is first transcribed to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase and immediately amplified and detected under isothermal reaction conditions [13, 14] . SIBA utilize a recombinase-coated single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) for the separation of a target duplex. This leads to the generation of a single-stranded target template, which subsequently becomes bound and extended by target-specific primers via the action of polymerase. The repeated cycles of recombinase-dependent strand separation and subsequent polymerase-dependent extension of the target leads to an exponential amplification under isothermal conditions.",

The assay was designed to amplif\u1ef9 70 nucleotides within the highly conserved region of the RSV N-protein gene. The assay used the same target region within the RSV-A and RSV-B genomes. The RSV-A and RSV-B genomes share about 90% homology within the chosen target region. A set of primers and invasion oligonucleotides (IOs) were designed to amplify this target region. The RSV assay used one forward primer, one reverse primer, two IOs, and one probe. The use of multiple IOs facilitated improved detection of RSV-A and RSV-B in the same reaction tube, but could not differentiate between the two subtypes of RSV. The RT-SIBA assay was also developed to detect the bacteriophage MS2. Target-specific probes for both the RSV and MS2 assays were designed as previously described [17] . This allowed the RSV and MS2 assays to be multiplexed in the same reaction tube. The MS2 assay served as an internal control for monitoring sample-derived inhibition [18] .",

The sensitivities of the RT-SIBA and RT-PCR assays for RSV were evaluated in three independent experiments by adding serial dilutions of RNA extracted from RSV, with 10-10 5 copies per reaction. Five replicates of each dilution were used. RT-SIBA reactions were detected using both target-specific probes and SYBR Green. The RSV assay included the MS2 internal control to assess sample-derived inhibition. The RSV probe was labeled with ROX and Iowa Black FQ quencher, whereas the MS2 probe was labeled with Cy5 and Iowa Black RQ quencher.",

Both RT-SIBA and RT-PCR reliably detected as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA (5/5 replicates in every control dilution). The average amount of time taken to achieve positive reactions in RT-SIBA was compared with the corresponding cycle threshold (ct) values for RT-PCR (Table 2) . RT-SIBA reactions were performed at a constant temperature and consequently did not require thermal cycling. Hence, RT-SIBA data were collected at 1 min intervals. RT-SIBA RSV assays detected 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B at approximately 14 and 16 min, respectively. The corresponding ct values for 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B RNA were approximately 27 and 30, respectively. The corresponding average amount of time taken to achieve positive reactions with RT-PCR can be around 2 h due to the initial reverse transcription step as well as the instrument ramp time. RSV was detected faster by RT-SIBA than by RT-PCR.",

This reduces the complexity of specimen preparation and could further shorten the total amount of time needed to detect RSV from clinical samples. The results are shown in Table 3 . RSV was detected in all 25 RSV-positive NP specimens by RT-SIBA using this crude sample lysis method. The detection of RSV by RT-SIBA was faster with clinical specimens extracted using a commercial extraction kit than with clinical specimens subjected to the rapid sample processing method. This could be due to a difference in the final amount of RNA present in the reaction. RSV was not detected in any of ND not determined, NP nasopharyngeal, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, RT-PCR reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-SIBA reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification, UTM universal transport medium, VTM viral transport medium the RSV-negative NP specimens by the RT-SIBA RSV assay. It took approximately 5 min per specimen to perform the rapid specimen preparation protocol, whereas purification of RNA from NP specimens took approximately 45 min.

            "text": "In this study, we developed and evaluated an alternative NAAT, RT-SIBA, for the rapid detection of RSV from NP swab specimens. This method is reported to be useful for the detection of pathogens [13, 14, 17, 19] . SIBA is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that relies on a recombinase-dependent oligonucleotide and target-specific primers to rapidly amplify a DNA duplex [14, 17] . The inclusion of a reverse transcription enzyme in SIBA reactions (RT-SIBA) facilitates the rapid detection of RNA from pathogens [13] . SIBA reactions are performed at a low and constant temperature (41\u00b0C) and therefore do not require complex instrumentation, in contrast with RT-PCR. Consequently, RT-SIBA is compatible with less complex devices, which could be suitable for point-of-care applications. These portable devices do not require highly specialised personnel to run and interpret the results [19, 20] . In this study, RT-SIBA reactions were performed with a qPCR device for the convenience of performing multiple reaction conditions and replicates. The RT-SIBA assay was developed to detect both the RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes, but not to distinguish between them. The developed RT-SIBA RSV assay displayed a similar analytical sensitivity and specificity as the RT-PCR method for the detection of RSV. The RT-SIBA assay detected 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B RNA after 14 and 16 min, respectively. The detection time differed between the RSV subtypes because the RSV-B target region has two nucleotides that are not complementary to the assay. SIBA can typically tolerate 1-3 nucleotide mutations in the assay target region, but this leads to a slightly slower detection time, as seen with RSV-B RNA [14] . Nonetheless, the detection time reported for RT-SIBA RSV was significantly faster than that of RT-PCR, which took approximately 2 h. RT-SIBA detected RSV in a highly specific manner, without cross-reacting with other common respiratory pathogens.",

The method was compatible with a rapid sample processing method, further shortening the total amount of time needed to detect RSV from clinical specimens. The detection times of RT-SIBA are similar to those of RADTs. RADTs used to detect RSV can take 15-30 min [21, 22] . However, RADTs are often less sensitive than RT-PCR [10] . Despite the superior sensitivity of RT-PCR over RADTs, RADTs still play an important role in the diagnosis of RSV, especially within point-ofcare settings, due to their rapid detection time and ease of use. RT-SIBA displayed a detection time as rapid as that of RADTs and a high analytical sensitivity similar to that of RT-PCR.",
