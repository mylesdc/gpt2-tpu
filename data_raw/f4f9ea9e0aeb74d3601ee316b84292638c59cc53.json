However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test. We also compare the performances of networks with different connectivity density and find that PLPIHS performs well across all the networks. Furthermore, we use the proposed method to identify the related proteins for lncRNA MALAT1. Highlyranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

The KATZ measure 20 is a weighted sum of the number of paths in the network that measures the similarity of two nodes. CATAPULT 19 is a supervised machine learning method that uses a biased support vector machine where the features are derived from walks in a heterogeneous gene-trait network. RWR 21 is a method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of similarities in protein-protein interaction networks and it add weight to the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein interactome that extend beyond the disease proteins themselves. LPIHN 22 is a network-based method by implement a random walk on a heterogeneous network. PRINCE is a global method based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. Compared with LPIHN and RWR, PRINCE propagates information in a smaller network but contains more connotative meaning when build the initial probability values and has made great performance in gene prioritization 23 and disease identification 24 .",

In this paper, we adopt a method named HeteSim, which is a path-based measure to calculate the relevance between objects in heterogeneous network 25 . The basic idea is that similar objects are more likely to be related to some other objects. Considering the relatedness of heterogeneous objects is path-constrained, HeteSim gives a uniform and symmetric measure for arbitrary paths to evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous object pair (same or different types) with one single score. Due to the relevance path not only captures the semantics information but also constrains the walk path, the score is also a path-based similarity measure.",

Path 1\u2032~14\u2032 obtains the best performance across all measures, which means that the path with length greater than three contains more significant meanings. The constant factor \u03b2 is used to control the influence of longer paths. The longer the path length is, the smaller the inhibiting factor is.

We extract 2000 lncRNA-protein associations from the 0.9 network as positive samples, the same number of negative samples are chosen randomly from the 0.3 network as well, avoiding the error caused by imbalance dataset. The gold set which containing 185 lncRNA-protein interactions downloaded from NPinter database has been included in positive pairs as well. In the lncRNA protein prioritization, each lncRNA-protein interaction is utilized as the test set in turn and the remaining associations are used as training data. The whole experiment will be repeated 4000 times to testing each lncRNA-protein pairs in the dataset. ROC curve is drawn based on true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds. The AUC score is utilized to measure the performance. AUC = 1 demonstrates the perfect performance and AUC = 0.5 demonstrates the random performance.The ROC curve of PLPIHS, LPIHS, PRINCE and RWR are plotted in Fig. 5 . The results show that the AUC score of PLPIHS in 0.3 network is 96.8%, which is higher than that of PRINCE, LPIHN and RWR, achieving an AUC value of 81.3%, 88.4% and 79.2%, respectively.

Only a small number of lncRNA-protein interactions have been well-characterized. Computational methods can be helpful in suggesting potential interactions for possible experimentation 25 . In this study, we use HeteSim measure to calculate the relevance between lncRNA and protein in a heterogeneous network. The importance of inferring novel lncRNA-protein interactions by considering the subtle semantic meanings of different paths in the heterogeneous network have been verified 39 . We first construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network. Then, we use the HeteSim measure to calculate a score for each lncRNA-protein pairs in each path. Finally, a SVM classifier is used to combine the scores of different paths and making predictions. We compare the proposed PLPIHS with PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN and find that PLPIHS obtain an AUC score of 0.9679 in 0.3 network, which is significantly higher than PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN (0.813, 0.884 and 0.7918, respectively). We also compare the performance of these four methods in networks of different connectivity density. As a result, PLPIHS outperforms the other method across all the networks. Moreover, when analysing the predicted proteins interacted with lncRNA MALAT1, PLPIHS successfully predicts 63 out of 68 associations, while PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN retrieve much lower interactions of 57, 57 and 53, respectively. And the top-ranked lncRNA-protein interactions predicted by our method are supported by existing literatures.

The PLPIHS method. Among a heterogeneous network, different paths can express different semantic meanings. For instance, a lncRNA and a protein is connected via 'lncRNA-lncRNA-protein' path or 'lncRNA-protein-protein' path representing totally different meanings. The former means that if a lncRNA is associated with a protein, then another lncRNA similar to the lncRNA will be potential associated with the protein. The latter shows that if a protein associated with a lncRNA, then another protein interacted with the protein will be likely associated with the lncRNA. Therefore, the potential information hidden in each path is extraordinary essential to be taken into account during prediction.",

            "text": "The PLPIHS framework is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Firstly, we construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network. Three kinds of sparse networks are obtained from the heterogeneous network under different cutoff value 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 (see lncRNA-Protein associations). The larger cutoff is, the network is more sparse. A total of 15941 lncRNAs genes and 20284 protein-coding genes are extracted as presented in Section 2.3. We randomly take out 1511 lncRNAs and 344 proteins to construct a smaller network for the following experiments in consideration of computing costs. The construction of the smaller heterogeneous networks under different cutoff values are shown in Table 4 , where 'lnc2lnc' denotes the lncRNA-lncRNA network, 'lnc2code' denotes the lncRNA-protein network and 'code2code' denotes the protein-lncRNA network. Table 1 . We use id to indicate the path combination, i.e., 1\u2032~2\u2032 represents path 'LLP' and path 'LPP' . Next, we calculate the heteSim score for each lncRNA-protein pair under each path. The results of different paths are used as different features. And we combine a constant factor \u03b2 to inhibit the influence of longer paths.The longer the path length is, the smaller the inhibiting factor is. Finally, a SVM classifier is built with these scores to predict potential lncRNA-protein associations. On the account of the HeteSim measure is based on the path-based relevance framework 39 , it can effectively dig out the subtle semantics of each paths. ",
