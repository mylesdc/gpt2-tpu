A longitudinal profile of the infection showed that seroconversion detected by ELISAs based on the recombinant extracellular domain, S, S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens occurred as early as neutralizing antibodies were detected by the ppNT and earlier than antibodies were detected by the inactivated MERS-CoV and N-terminal domain (NTD) ELISAs. Antibodies detected by the NP ELISA occurred last. Strong correlations were found between the S1, RBD and NP ELISAs and the inactivated MERS-CoV ELISA. The S and RBD ELISAs were highly correlated with the commercial S1 ELISA. The S ELISA strongly correlated with the ppNT, although the MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs were also significantly correlated with the ppNT (Po0.001).",

Recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are preferred for diagnosis owing to their high efficiency and reproducibility. Importantly, such assays do not require cultivation of MERS-CoV in biosafety level 3 facilities, which are not readily available in most laboratories. Although an S1-based ELISA Kit is commercially available and has been used in many studies, 2-6 data are limited on comparing ELISAs that detect MERS-CoV antibodies in humans based on alternative recombinant antigens, including the extracellular domain (representative of the full-length spike protein (S)), N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (NP). We used a series of sera from the first imported case of MERS in China to longitudinally evaluate antibody production and to compare the antigenicity of whole inactivated MERS-CoV, S, S1, NTD, RBD and NP. The sera were also used to investigate the correlation of ELISAs with the pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test (ppNT).",

A case investigation revealed a history of exposure to the first confirmed MERS case in South Korea when the male patient in question had visited his father who had been admitted to the same hospital ward as that of the Korean patient with MERS-CoV. On 20 May, while in Korea, the patient complained of feeling unwell but had no respiratory symptoms; his temperature was 38.7\u00b0C on 25 May. However, 1 day later, against medical advice, he traveled from South Korea to Guangdong province (mainland China) via Hong Kong. On 27 May 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Health was notified of the patient's entry into China by the World Health Organization (WHO). The man was confirmed to be MERS-CoV-positive on 28 May and was immediately admitted to a hospital. 7 He was discharged from the hospital at the end of June 2015. A series of venous blood samples were collected from the patient after he was admitted to the hospital. Normal control sera from 40 healthy blood donors (both sexes) were used to detect background values and calculate the cutoff values for the methods used in this study. The blood samples were processed within 24 h of collection, and the sera were stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C.",

After 24 h of incubation, fresh medium was added, followed by incubation for an additional 48 h. The cells were washed with PBS and then lysed using the lysis reagent included in the Luciferase Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottomed luminometry plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY, USA), followed by addition of the luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative fluorescence intensity values were immediately determined using a Gaomax luminometer (Promega). The luciferase activity of Huh7.5-CD81 cells treated with pseudovirus alone (reference group) was defined as 100% infection. Cells not treated with pseudovirus were included as a background control. The results were expressed as the percentage of infection compared with those of the control group (Huh7.5 cells treated with only pseudovirus preparations). Fifty percent reductions in relative fluorescence intensity were used to calculate MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in the sera. The NAb titers were defined as the highest serum dilutions that resulted in a 50% reduction in luciferase activity. NAb titers lower than 1:100 were considered negative.",

In a previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) study, an S protein-based ELISA also appeared to be more sensitive than a virus-based Huada ELISA for detecting SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. 11 The NP of SARS-CoV is an immunodominant antigen that is used to detect SARS-CoV infection. 11, 12 In the present study, our NP-based ELISA illustrated the benefit of using recombinant NP for detecting MERS-CoV infection. However, seroconversion of NPspecific antibodies occurred later than seroconversion of antibodies against several S proteins and inactivated MERS-CoV. Woo et al. 12 evaluated the longitudinal profile of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV NP in patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV. The study showed that the levels of the two antibodies increased to detectable levels by the third week of illness, which was approximately 1 week later than that observed in another study by Lie et al., 13 based on a whole SARS-CoV ELISA. The 1-week delay in seroconversion of NP-specific antibodies in the study by Woo et al. 12 compared with the results of Li et al. 13 may reflect reduced sensitivity of NP-based ELISAs based on inactivated virus particles for detecting SARS-CoV infection at an early stage of illness, although clinical treatment may also interfere with the appearance of antibodies. The results of the two studies confirmed the characteristics of NP-specific antibodies in different contexts. Woo et al. 12 reported that IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV NP increased to detectable levels later than IgG antibodies, in contrast to the phenomena described for most other pathogens. We found that IgM antibodies against some antigens were detectable at the same time or later than IgG in the present study, which may have been due to the earlier development of IgG than IgM antibodies or the different sensitivities of the Ig class-specific ELISAs. 12 The S1-based ELISA Kit has the advantages of easy operation and convenience, and it has been validated and applied in many studies. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 14, 15 In the present study, gradual increases in S1-specific Figure 1A ) were plotted against neutralizing antibody titers (data are those from Figure 1C ). *Po0.05; **Po0.01; ***Po0.001. Antibody, Ab; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA; immunoglobulin G, IgG; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV; nucleoprotein, NP; N-terminal domain, NTD; optical density, OD; pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test, ppNT; receptor-binding domain, RBD; recombinant MERS-CoV full-length spike protein, S. serum IgG antibody levels were observed in the first patient to import MERS-CoV into China, as was the case for most MERS-CoV patients in other studies performed in South Korea 6, 15 and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 14 Seroconversion of the S1-specific IgG antibody was observed 8 days after admission (16 days after the onset of illness), which was consistent with previous findings. 6 Moreover, the S1 ELISA maintained an excellent correlation with inactivated MERS-CoV and S ELISAs (Po0.001). In the present study, the recombinant RBD (which is the main epitope of S1) was as sensitive as S1 for detecting MERS-CoV infection, and there was an excellent correlation between the RBD ELISA and S1 ELISA, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.9701. Therefore, RBD can be developed as an alternative antigen for ELISA kits to detect MERS-CoV infection.",

Moreover, the ppNT assay showed an excellent correlation with the S ELISA, although the latter is a binding assay while the former is a functional neutralizing assay. The MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs (OD 450 ) had acceptable but lower Pearson's correlation coefficients (0.71-0.8439) when compared with the ppNT titer. We speculate that this is because there are multiple components irrelevant to neutralization in inactivated MERS-CoV and fewer epitopes related to neutralization in recombinant S1, NTD and RBD.",

Fortunately, a series of serum samples was collected from this case. Additionally, a commercial S1-based ELISA Kit was available and was adopted as the reference test. We found that the ELISAs of various recombinant structural proteins, including S, S1, NTD, RBD and NP, as well as the ppNT assay, can be used for MERS-CoV diagnosis and seroepidemiology. The S, S1 and RBD ELISAs were more sensitive than other ELISA formats, especially the S1 and RBD ELISAs were advantageous because the recombinant S1 and RBD are smaller than the full-length S and easier to express and purify.",

Serum samples from the patient with MERS-CoV collected on days 2 (sample 1), 15 (sample 2) and 28 (sample 3) after admission to the hospital were serially diluted and dispensed into the wells of an ELISA plate. HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (left) and IgM (right) were used as the secondary antibody, with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate. The results are expressed as the absorbance reading at 450 nm. As the negative control had very poor ELISA responses, the results are not shown to avoid interference with the target profiles. enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, ELISA; horseradish peroxidase, HRP; immunoglobulin G/M, IgG/M; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV; nucleoprotein, NP; N-terminal domain, NTD; optical density, OD; receptor-binding domain, RBD; recombinant MERS-CoV full-length spike protein, S.
