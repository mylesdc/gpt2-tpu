            "text": "We have previously demonstrated that 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3HP)-modified bovine beta-lactoglobulin (3HP-\u03b2-LG) is highly effective in inhibiting entry of pseudovirus (PsV) of high-and low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) into the target cell. Intravaginally applied 3HP-\u03b2-LG-containing vaginal gel could significantly inhibit HPV infection and reduce viral load in the cervical region. However, we still do not understand the underlying molecular mechanism by which 3HP-\u03b2-LG is able to inhibit HPV infection. Here, though, we showed that 3HP-\u03b2-LG did not inactivate HPV PsV, but rather blocked entry of HPV PsV into the target cell via its interaction with virus, not cell. It bound to the positively charged region in the HPV L1 protein, suggesting that 3HP-\u03b2-LG binds to HPV L1 protein through the interaction between the negatively charged region in 3HP-\u03b2-LG and the positively charged region in HPV L1 protein, thus competitively blocking the binding of HPV to the receptor on the basement membrane in vaginal mucosa. Although 3HP-modified chicken ovalbumin (3HP-OVA) also carries high net negative charges, it exhibited no anti-HPV activity, suggesting that the interaction between 3HP-modified protein and HPV L1 protein relies on both electrostatic and matchable conformation of the binding sites in both proteins. When topically applied, 3HP-\u03b2-LG did not enter the host cell or blood circulation. These findings suggest that 3HP-\u03b2-LG targets HPV L1 protein and blocks HPV entry into the host cell, thus being safe and effective for topical application in the treatment of HPV infection.",

Almost all these cases result from the persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) (Bosch et al., 2002) . HPVs are a large viral family consisting of about 200 different types (Bernard et al., 2010) . Among them, 18 types have high oncogenic properties, and these are regarded as the high-risk types, such as HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58. The high-risk types of HPV have relatively low self-clearance rate compared to the low-risk types of HPV (Safaeian et al., 2008) . To prevent the infection of these highrisk HPVs and the occurrence of cervical cancer, several prophylactic vaccines, like Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9 (Deschuyteneer et al., 2010; McCormack, 2014) , have been developed and approved for marketing in many countries. However, no therapeutic vaccines or drugs have been approved for clinical use to treat HPV-infected patients.",

Analysis of the atomic structure of native T = 7 HPV virus-like particle (VLP) reveals that 72 L1 pentamers form the icosahedral shell of HPV (Baker et al., 1991; Li et al., 2016) . The L1 pentamer strongly binds to HPV receptors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), on the basement membrane to mediate viral entry and infection (Kines et al., 2009) . The highly potent neutralizing antibodies elicited by HPV vaccines were found to bind to the L1 protein and prevent HPV infection (Li et al., 2018) . Thus, the L1 pentamer is regarded as the most important target for development of antiviral agents against HPV infection.",

Jiang et al. reported the first peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor, SJ-2176 , in 1993 (Jiang et al., 1993 and the first HIV entry inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug, enfuvirtide, was approved by U.S. FDA for clinical use in 2003 (Dando and Perry, 2003) . Later, Jiang and colleagues have reported that anhydride-modified proteins such as 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3HP)-modified proteins are potent virus entry inhibitors against a number of enveloped viruses, such as HIV , herpes simplex virus (HSV) , and Ebola virus (EBOV) (Li et al., 2017) . In 2012, Jiang's group reported that 3HP-modified bovine beta-lactoglobulin (3HP\u03b2-LG) could also inhibit entry into the target cell of the pseudovirus (PsV) of non-enveloped virus, HPV (high-risk HPV16 and HPV18, and low-risk HPV6) (Lu et al., 2013) . In the clinical trial, the topical application of vaginal gel containing 3HP-\u03b2-LG was proven to be very safe and highly effective in suppressing HPV infection and reducing viral load in vaginal mucosa (Guo et al., 2016a,b) . However, we still do not understand the molecular mechanism by which 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibits HPV infection. In this study, we found that while 3HP-\u03b2-LG could not inactivate HPV PsV, it was effective in inhibiting HPV PsV entry into the host cell via its interaction with virus, not the cell. Unlike \u03b2-LG, 3HP-\u03b2-LG could bind with L1 protein and the peptides derived from the positively charged region in the HPV L1 protein, suggesting that 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibits HPV infection by binding, via its negatively charged region, to L1 protein, and thus competitively blocking HPV binding to the receptor on the basement membrane in vaginal mucosa, which then inhibits HPV from entering and replicating in the host cell. We have also shown that topically applied 3HP-\u03b2-LG does not enter the host cell and blood circulation. Therefore, the 3HP-\u03b2-LG-containing formulations can be safely used in vagina for treatment of HPV infection and prevention of cervical cancer development.",

To answer this question, we compared the inhibitory activity of 3HP-\u03b2-LG with that of 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (3HP-HSA) and 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified chicken ovalbumin (3HP-OVA) against entry of HPV16 PsV into HeLa cells, using the unmodified \u03b2-LG, HSA, and OVA as controls. As shown in Figure 1A , 3HP-\u03b2-LG exhibited potent anti-HPV activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.59 \u03bcg/ml, which is more potent than that of 3HP-HSA (IC 50 : 2.28 \u03bcg/ml). 3HP-OVA and all three unmodified proteins at the concentration as high as 10 \u03bcg/ml showed no significant inhibitory activity against HPV16 PsV entry into the target cell.

Therefore, we synthesized two positively charged peptides in this region of L1 protein, L1-I (residues 474-488) and L1-II (residues 493-505). The binding ability of 3HP-\u03b2-LG and \u03b2-LG to these peptides was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). As shown in Figure 2B , \u03b2-LG had no obvious binding to L1-I or L1-II peptide, while 3HP-\u03b2-LG showed high binding ability against both L1-I (binding constant K \u03b1 value equals 2.31 \u00d7 10 5 /M) and L1-II (binding constant K \u03b1 value equals 1.04 \u00d7 10 5 /M). These results suggested that 3HP-\u03b2-LG may bind to the positively charged sites in the C-terminal region of L1 protein on the HPV surface to block the interaction between the viral particle and cell receptor.",

As shown in Figure 3A , the treated virus could still infect the target host cell with no reduced activity, compared the control virus (DMEM-or \u03b2-LG-treated), suggesting that the binding between 3HP-\u03b2-LG and HPV PsV may be noncovalent and reversible so that 3HP-\u03b2-LG cannot permanently inactive the virus. HPV entry into the host cell takes more than 10 h, a relatively slow process compared to other viruses (Aksoy et al., 2017) , which provides a long window period for an entry inhibitor to bind with the viral protein responsible for interaction with the receptor on the target cell and block viral entry. Here, we performed a time-addition assay to pinpoint the window of functional 3HP-\u03b2-LG blocking of HPV entry into the target cell. As shown in Figure 3B , 3HP-\u03b2-LG (15 \u03bcg/ml) could fully inhibit HPV16 PsV entry when it was added to the cells 0.5 h before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after addition of HPV16 PsV, respectively, while about 70, 10, and 5% of HPV16 PsV entry were blocked when 3HP-\u03b2-LG was added to the cells 12, 24, and 48 h after addition of HPV16 PsV, respectively ( Figure 3B ). This result suggests that during this relatively long period of entry process (Aksoy et al., 2017) , the entry inhibitor 3HP-\u03b2-LG remains sufficiently active to inhibit HPV PsV entry into the target cell.",

At 4\u00b0C, HPV PsV could bind to cell receptors, but could not fully enter the cytoplasm because the speeds of membrane fusion and cytoskeletal transformation are largely reduced at such low temperature. We incubated HPV PsV and HeLa cells at 4\u00b0C for 12 h so that HPV could bind to the cell surface. Then we washed away the unbound HPV before shifting the cells to 37\u00b0C for further 72 h of incubation. When 3HP-\u03b2-LG was added into the cells at the beginning and then removed by washing, no viral entry occurred (Figure 3C ). This proved that 3HP-\u03b2-LG blocked the attachment between PsV and cell receptor at the earliest stage of infection. To determine whether 3HP-\u03b2-LG could also bind to the receptor on the target cell surface to block HPV entry, we incubated HeLa cells with 3HP-\u03b2-LG (control: \u03b2-LG) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were washed with DMEM to remove the unbound proteins, or not washed (as control), before addition of HPV PsV. Under the washing conditions, HPV PsV entry into the HeLa cells was not blocked, while under the non-washing conditions, HPV PsV entry into the HeLa cells was effectively blocked. No inhibition was observed in the \u03b2-LG control groups, no matter whether the \u03b2-LG-treated HeLa cells were LG was unable to inactivate HPV PsV. HPV PsV was incubated with 3HP-\u03b2-LG (control: \u03b2-LG) at room temperature for 2 h and then separated by PEG-8000 to analyze its entry activity.

Indeed, 3HP-\u03b2-LG can also inhibit infection of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (Wyand et al., 1999) and HSV , but it is not effective against infection of MERS-CoV and VSV (unpublished data) . In this study, we showed that 3HP-modified HSA (3HP-HSA) was also effective, while 3HP-modified OVA (3HP-OVA) was not effective in inhibiting HPV PsV entry (Figure 1) , even though 3HP-OVA also contains high net negative charges on its surface. Thus, aside from having high net negative charges, these results suggest that the active site in 3HP-\u03b2-LG for binding to the viral protein must possess a conformation that fits with that in the corresponding site in the viral protein (Figure 6B) , enabling 3HP-\u03b2-LG to strongly and closely interact with the viral protein to block HPV entry into the host cell. Indeed, the molecular docking analysis indicated that 3HP-\u03b2-LG could strongly bind to the positively charged region of HPV L1 protein, which is the binding site for the negatively charged HSPG receptor for HPV ( Figure 6B ). 3HP-\u03b2-LG has many more negative charges on the surface, and the interface between 3HP-\u03b2-LG and HPV-L1 is much larger than the HSPG molecule. Therefore, 3HP-\u03b2-LG can competitively bind to HPV L1 to block the binding of the HSPG receptor.",

The newly invaded HPV accesses the basal cell layer through micro lesions or breaks in the cervical epithelium and binds to the HSPG receptor on the basement membrane through interaction between the positively charged region in L1 protein of HPV and the negatively charged region in HSPG. This interaction results in a series of conformational changes in the capsid, which leads to protease digestion of L2 and exposure of its N terminus, thus initiating entry of HPV into to the epithelial cells (Kines et al., 2009; Pyeon et al., 2009) . After HPV infects the epithelial cell, it gradually matures along with the host cell cycles and moves toward the top layer of epithelia, followed by eventual release from the epidermal cells.

These biological properties of 3HP-\u03b2-LG make it an ideal anti-HPV agent for topical application to treat HPV infection because it can interact with HPV particles on the vaginal mucosa and block the virions binding to the receptor, e.g., HSPG, on basement membrane. Since 3HP-\u03b2-LG cannot enter into the cell or the blood circulation, it is not expected to cause systemic toxicity to human or induce harmful 3HP-\u03b2-LG-specific antibodies. Therefore, the topical formulations containing 3HP-\u03b2-LG can be safely used to treat local HPV infection.

The newly invaded or newly released HPV particles access the basal layer through the mucosal lesion, or breaks, and bind to the HSPG receptor on the basement membrane, resulting in the entry of HPV into and replication in mucosal epithelial cells. 3HP-\u03b2-LG can bind with HPV L1 protein, through the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged region in 3HP-\u03b2-LG and the positively charged region in L1 protein, to block the attachment of HPV to the HSPG receptor, resulting in inhibition of HPV infection in vaginal mucosa.",
