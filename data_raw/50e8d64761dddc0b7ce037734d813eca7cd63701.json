            "text": "Bats are reservoirs for many different coronaviruses (CoVs) as well as many other important zoonotic viruses. We sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1,044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within Colorado from 2007 to 2009. We detected alphacoronavirus RNA in bats of 4 species: big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 10% prevalence; long-legged bats (Myotis volans), 8% prevalence; little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), 3% prevalence; and western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis), 2% prevalence. Overall, juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for CoV RNA as adult bats. At two of the rural sampling sites, CoV RNAs were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study. CoV RNA was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested. Individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for CoV RNA and later sampled again all became CoV RNA negative. Nucleotide sequences in the RdRp gene fell into 3 main clusters, all distinct from those of Old World bats. Similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat, indicating that a CoV may be capable of infecting bats of different genera. These data suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species. Alphacoronavirus RNA was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations (10%) and known to have direct contact with people (19%), suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses. Further CoV surveillance studies in bats throughout the Americas are warranted.",

Two newly discovered human reoviruses, Melaka virus and Kampar virus, associated with influenza-like illnesses in humans, may be transmitted from small flying foxes (fruit bats; Pteropus hypomelanus) based on the close phylogenetic relationships of these viruses to Pulau virus, a bat reovirus [7, 8] .

The SARS pandemic of 2002-03 was caused by SARS-CoV, a zoonotic coronavirus recently emerged from horseshoe bats (suborder Microchiroptera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) from different locations in southeastern China [11, 12] . Extensive worldwide surveillance of bats showed that bats carry an enormous diversity of CoVs [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences of coronaviruses from bats, humans, birds, and other vertebrates suggests that bats may be the reservoir hosts from which all coronavirus lineages originated [23, 24] .",

Bats were identified to species based on external morphological characteristics as described in regional faunal manuals [26, 27] adopting revised taxonomy for Myotis occultus [28] and Parastrellus hesperus [29] . To determine whether CoVs persist in bat populations over the course of several years, additional bat fecal samples were collected during the summers of 2008 and 2009 at two rural sites in north central and southeastern Colorado. In addition, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were sampled at 5 different sites (sites #17-21) within a single urban municipality in Northern Colorado (Fort Collins) during the summers of 2007 and 2008. These sites were chosen because they were in close proximity to humans [30] . Site #17 was in a vintage farmhouse that is currently being used as a family visitation center; site #18 was a natural creek surrounded by suburban neighborhoods; site #19 was in the recreation center of a church; site #20 was within an education building, and site #21 was within a picnic pavilion at a public park. Several of these sites had been previously used in rabies ecology studies, and some bats had been tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) for host demographic analysis [31, 32] .

The closest bat coronavirus spike sequence to RM-Bt-CoV 453/2007 found in GenBank, was Bt-CoV A701, from an Old World species, Rickett's big-footed bat (Myotis ricketti) sampled in Southeast China in 2005 [14] (65% nucleotide identity, 65% amino acid identity).",

Our data indicate that nucleotide sequences of alphacoronaviruses harbored by Colorado bats are distinct from those found in Old World bats. Two recent studies of the bat guano virome using next generation sequence technology also only detected alphacoronaviruses in the New World bats of the species tested, as well as a diverse array of other types of viruses [41, 42] .

No bat families of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera occur in the New World. [43] . The finding of only alphacoronaviruses in our study may be because bats of these species are resistant to other CoVs and/or bats from different parts of the New World have yet to be tested for CoV infection, as we sampled bats from only a subset of the hundreds of species that reside in the New World.",

As 75% of living genera of all bats worldwide are found in the New Worlds tropics alone, further CoV surveillance in bats of additional species from different regions in the Western hemisphere may reveal hitherto undetected varieties of coronaviruses. The seasonal epidemiology and persistence of New World CoV infections in individual bats and within bat populations has not been elucidated. The most comprehensive epidemiological investigation of CoVs to date in Old World bat populations showed that the prevalence of SARS-Rh-BatCoVs in rhinolophid bats over a four-year period at collection sites in Hong Kong SAR and China peaked in the spring and varied from year to year. We found similar results in New World bats. At site #4 long-legged bats had an alphacoronavirus RNA prevalence of 31% in 2007, 19% in 2009, but only 6% in 2008. In all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled, CoVs persisted in bat roosts throughout the course of the non-hibernating part of the year (spring/summer) and persisted from year to year. We also found that the prevalence of CoV infection in these bat roosts tended to peak in late spring/ early summer. The prevalence of infection with human CoVs also shows significant annual variations [45] , possibly depending on environmental conditions and/or fluctuating CoV antibody levels in the population. Possible seasonal variation in CoV infection rates may explain why in our initial 2006 study we found a high prevalence (50%) of alphacoronavirus RNA in occult bats [17] , but in 2007 we did not detect any positive individuals (22 tested in the same region).",

In Asia and Germany, different species of bats roosting in the same cave were found to host different CoVs, whereas bats of the same species in different locations harbored similar CoVs [14, 19] . In Europe, strict associations were found between bat CoV deduced amino acid sequences in an 816 bp fragment of the RdRp gene and their specific bat hosts [40] . In Africa, CoVs found in one species of bat were not detected in bats of different species co-roosting in the same cave [38] . Similarly, our study showed that New World bats of the same species in geographically distinct locations and over the course of several years harbor similar CoVs. In contrast to these findings, in Kenya some CoVs appear to be able to infect Old World bats of several different species [21] . Our preliminary nucleotide sequence data also suggests that we found very closely related CoV nucleotide sequences in New World bats from three different species of Myotis (M. volans, M. evotis, and M. occultus). Furthermore, in site #4, we found similar nucleotide sequences in the spike and replicase genes in CoV RNAs from both a big-brown bat and a long-legged bat, suggesting that at least some New World bat CoVs may be able to infect bats of different genera. These findings are notable, as recent phylogenetic studies of rabies viruses in bats suggest that host species barriers play a key role in cross species transmission of viruses [46] .",

Big brown bats are common inhabitants of buildings in cities and towns in Colorado and across the United States, and are the primary species encountered by humans in terms of potential exposure to disease agents [30, 33, 47] These bats had a high prevalence of CoV infection, ranging from 0-67% (overall 10%) depending on the site and time of year. Big brown bats submitted to the CDPHE for rabies testing because of known direct contact with humans also had a very high prevalence (19%) of CoV infection. Because bats which have known or potential contact with humans have such a high prevalence of CoV infection, opportunities exist for potential transmission of these viruses to humans.",

            "text": "Following the SARS epidemic, intensive surveillance detected a great diversity of CoVs throughout the animal kingdom. CoVs can undergo a high frequency of RNA recombination, both in vitro and in vivo, which may play an important role in their evolution and virulence [48] . Old World bat CoVs of several different genotypes were found to co-exist in a single bat [49] . Thus recombination between different bat CoVs could potentially occur in vivo, giving rise to new CoV genomes. Two strains of HCoV-HKU1 have recombined to yield a novel HCoV-HKU1 genotype [16] , and recombination between different strains of SARS-CoV-like viruses in bats may have given rise to civet SARS-CoV [37] . The great diversity of CoVs, their high frequency of RNA recombination, their ability to persist in bat populations, and the finding that some CoVs can apparently infect bats of divergent genera, suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats may pose a continuing threat for emergence of novel CoVs into new hosts. Table S1 Primers and RT-PCR programs. A. Consensus primers targeted a highly conserved region of the S2 region of the spike gene and from an exact sequence obtained from one of the big brown bats. PCR was performed under the following conditions: one mL of cDNA was amplified in a 50-mL reaction containing, 0.2 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1 U of PhusionTaq High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), and 2.0 mmol/L primers by the following PCR program: 30 sec at 98uC; 40 cycles for 10 sec at 98uC, 15 sec at 50-52uC (depending on the primer set), and 15 sec at 72uC; and then 10 min at 72uC. B. Primers used for detection of CoV sequence in bat samples. One microliter of cDNA was amplified in a 50-mL reaction containing 1.5 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 0.2 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2.5 U of HotStarTaq (QIAGEN), and 2.0 mmol/L primers using the following PCR program: 15 min at 95uC; 45 cycles for 1 min at 95uC, 1 min at 48uC for MY-F and MY-R and 50uC for EF-F and EF-R, and 1 min at 72uC; and 10 min at 72uC. C. To obtain additional sequences for phylogenetic analysis, for two of the CDPHE intestinal samples, RT-PCR was performed using consensus degenerate primers from several areas within the RdRp gene in a SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). Primers and protocols were kindly provided by Suxiang Tong, PhD and Ying Tao, PhD of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",

The prevalence of CoV RNA was 12.0% (61 positive bats of 494 tested) for big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 8.2% (12 positives of 147 sampled) for long-legged bats (Myotis volans), 3.2% (1 positive of 31 sampled) for little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), and 1.9% (1 positive of 52 sampled) for western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis). CoV RNA was detected in bat samples from only 2 of the 16 rural locations, but in all five of the urban locations sampled (Figure 1). The CDPHE provided 61 bats of 4 different species for testing of intestinal samples for CoV RNA. Of those sampled, 7 (11%) bats from 5 of the 11 Colorado counties sampled were positive for CoV RNA (Figure 1).
