A lack of intense research over the last decades and increasing resistances to the recommended antibiotics call for a better understanding of gonococcal infection, fast diagnostics and therapeutic measures against N. gonorrhoeae. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify novel immunogenic proteins as a first step to advance those unresolved problems. For the identification of immunogenic proteins, pHORF oligopeptide phage display libraries of the entire N. gonorrhoeae genome were constructed. Several immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae. Corresponding full-length proteins of the identified oligopeptides were expressed and their immunogenic character was verified by ELISA. The immunogenic character of six proteins was identified for the first time. Additional 13 proteins were verified as immunogenic proteins in N. gonorrhoeae.",

It belongs to the genus Neisseria that also includes the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis and several non-pathogenic species, e. g. Neisseria lactamica or Neisseria cinerea. N. gonorrhoeae is often abbreviated as gonococcus and is the causative agent of gonorrhoea, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI) with an estimated number of 106 million new infections worldwide in 2012 [1] . It colonizes the urogenital epithelial cells and can shift to the upper genital tract which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women [2, 3] . In rare cases, gonococcal infection can cause sterility in men and infertility in women as implications of PID [4] . Furthermore, recent studies mention that a gonococcal infection increases HIV transmission rates [5, 6] . Given that around 80% of gonococcal infections in women [4] and to a lesser extent in men [7] [8] [9] [10] are asymptomatic, treatment as well as diagnosis are hindered.",

Lately, resistant strains against the last line of defence-the cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone-were isolated in different parts of the world [13] [14] [15] .

Due to a multiplicity of evasion mechanisms to circumvent the immune response, e. g. antigenic variability of surface structure [16, 17] as well as production of IgA 1 proteases [18, 19] , there is only a minimal antibody generation detectable after infection. Furthermore, the immune response primarily occurs at the mucosal level that is not sustained leading to potentially high reinfection rates even with the same strain [15] . For these reasons, the development of a vaccine is complex and is not in immediate sight [10, 12] . Nevertheless, by examination and determination of novel immunogenic proteins specific ways for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae could be possibly found, for instance, by inactivating virulence associated proteins preventing infection or by specifically disturbing essential cell processes.",

State of the art in gonococcal diagnosis is the isolation and cultivation followed by gram stain to identify N. gonorrhoeae and to simultaneously screen for antibiotic resistances [4] . Drawbacks are long incubation times and insensitivity to asymptomatic infections [20] . Possible alternatives include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which have many advantages, e. g. easy specimen collection, insusceptible transportation, and time savings, but still have to be conducted by laboratory personnel and cannot distinguish between different antibiotic resistances [15, 21] . Since a large number of infections occur asymptomatic and many people suffering from STIs feel ashamed to see a physician, it would be a great benefit to have an easy-to-use and inexpensive diagnostic tool such as a urine test strip to identify N. gonorrhoeae cells in urine. Due to antigenic variability and a limited knowledge, there is a lack of suitable proteins. Hence, these challenges might be overcome by identifying novel immunogenic proteins as targets for the development of detection methods or for vaccine research. Furthermore, the identified proteins might elucidate mechanisms of gonococcal infection. Commonly, the identification of immunogenic proteins is performed by 2D-PAGE and immunoblot followed by mass spectrometry [22] [23] [24] [25] , by time and labour consuming expression of the proteome and screening on nitrocellulose membranes [26] , or recently by microarray technique [27] [28] [29] . However, all of these methods have certain disadvantages. Approaches with 2D-PAGE and expression libraries with cDNA have limitations in detecting differentially expressed proteins, e. g. in host-pathogen interaction, weakly expressed proteins or proteins with a molecular weight below 10 kDa [30] [31] [32] . Expression libraries of the complete proteome entail complex production and purification procedures. Furthermore, screenings of thousands of clones have to be accomplished. In contrast, phage display of antigens may avoid these limitations. Phage display technology was invented by George P. Smith thirty years ago [33] . This technology is mainly used for antibody selection [34] [35] [36] but has also been applied to identify immunogenic proteins from genomic and cDNA libraries [37] .",

Oligopeptides or protein domains are displayed on the surface of the M13 phage particles and the corresponding genetic information on the phagemid is packaged in the phage particles. Thus, the phenotype (protein fragments) is coupled with the genotype (corresponding gene fragments). By using polyclonal antibodies, patient or animal sera, immunogenic oligopeptides are selected in a panning procedure [41] . This technology allows for the discovery of immunogenic proteins independent from pathogen cultivation, thus also identifying proteins only expressed in the patient (in vivo host pathogen context) [37] . This method has been used successfully to identify a list of novel biomarkers from Salmonella Typhimurium and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [41] [42] [43] . The technology was also used to identify biomarkers of ticks [44] . Compared to competing technologies like 2D-PAGE of proteins from cultivated pathogens followed by immunoblot using sera and mass spectrometry, the pHORF technology also allows identifying proteins expressed only in host-pathogen interaction and proteins smaller than 10 kDa. Other methods such as SEREX [45] working with lytic T7 phage or phage display systems also using M13 do not have a simple open reading frame enrichment to increase the library quality.",

Through two to three consecutive rounds of panning and final screening with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to N. gonorrhoeae, 21 potentially immunogenic oligopeptides were identified. Thirteen corresponding proteins were expressed in full-length and the immunogenic character of 11 thereof was verified. Six full-length proteins were identified as immunogenic for the first time; most of the remaining identified oligopeptides have been described in literature within the closely related pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The immunogenic character of these proteins was validated for N. gonorrhoeae in this study. Furthermore, the proteins were modelled and the phage displayed oligopeptides were mapped to the obtained models, indicating those parts of the protein with higher immunogenic character. The obtained immunogenic proteins could serve as promising candidates for the further clarification of gonococcal infection and for the development of effective agents against N. gonorrhoeae.",

In contrast, immunoproteome studies of N. gonorrhoeae have not been available yet. In this work, we conducted an immunoproteomic approach to identify novel immunogenic proteins of N. gonorrhoeae. Due to low antibody titers in humans, no human sera are accessible. Hence, polyclonal rabbit antibodies to N. gonorrhoeae were applied for panning and screenings. The screening of a pHORF phage display library successfully yielded a number of previously unknown immunogenic proteins. Identification of novel immunogenic proteins might grant additional insight into their role in pathogenicity and virulence of N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, proteins involved in the pathogenic pathway might serve as potential candidates for therapeutic treatments.",

Six of those proteins had not been identified as immunogenic before and their immunogenic character was successfully validated by ELISA: NGO0170 is an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein that is involved in the transport of zinc/manganese. The localization is predicted to be in the cytoplasmic membrane. The phage displayed oligopeptide is located at the C-terminal end of the protein indicating the immunogenic part of the protein. The closest homologous structure identified by I-TASSER was a putative metal-chelate type ABC transporter of Haemophilus influenza [62] which occurs as hetero tetramer with two identical chains each. By comparing the query and aligned sequence, the oligopeptide identified by phage display was mapped to the part of the protein that is not embedded in the membrane ( Fig 4G) . Therefore, the identified oligopeptide is accessible by antibodies raised against it. On the other hand, it is most likely that the protein is facing inward to the cytoplasm hindering the accessibility of antibodies from the outside. However, localization and orientation are only predictions making it necessary to further investigate NGO0170. Interestingly, homologies on the amino acid level between NGO0170 (NMB0588) and an ORF of a potential pathogenicity island of E. coli have been described [67] underlining the possible influence of NGO0170 on the pathogenicity of N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, the homologue in N. meningitidis (NMB0588) was found to be upregulated at low zinc levels [68] . This condition often occurs during infection of the human host cells. A deletion mutant lacking NGO0170 could provide further information on the importance of this protein for the viability and virulence of N. gonorrhoeae. Depending on the impact, NGO0170 could be an attractive target for a novel therapeutic treatment for N. gonorrhoeae. NGO0326 is a highly conserved host factor-I binding protein abbreviated Hfq. Its function is the modulation of posttranscriptional regulation in stress response as a RNA chaperone. It is known to play a vital role in the virulence of different bacteria [69] [70] [71] including N. meningitidis [72] . Furthermore, it has been shown that a deletion of the homologue of NGO0326 in N. meningitidis leads to a differentiated expression of 369 NGO0170 determined by I-TASSER, a HI1470/1 transporter from H. influenza, embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane [62] .

Consequently, a real-time PCR analysis was performed to validate the presence of mRNA coding for this protein. It was shown that the gene encoding NGO1634 is transcribed into mRNA resulting in an expression of the according protein in culture under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, no functional bacteriophages have been found in N. gonorrhoeae [4] , although there are genomic regions that are related to lysogenic phage [78] . However, the region including NGO1634 is assumed to encode incomplete phage genomes. Hence, NGO1634 might be a protein of bacteriophage origin with a novel but yet unknown function in N. gonorrhoeae. BLAST results show a high identity of hits within N. gonorrhoeae strains, while only a few strains of other Neisseria species carry this gene. Future studies with monoclonal antibodies might reveal the precise localisation within the cell as well as the expression rate. Furthermore, a functional analysis of this protein might be achieved by generating deletion mutants to investigate the protein's influence on infection, viability and gonococcal virulence.",

A possible explanation is that the epitope is inaccessible to the antibody within the full-length protein, while the shorter oligopeptide does not suffer from these limitations. Furthermore, if conformational epitopes are formed and recognised, it is highly possible that the secondary structure of truncated oligopeptide and full-length protein differ. Consequently, it is essential to validate the immunogenic character on full-length protein level. Apart from these newly described immunogenic proteins, this method revealed several other proteins that have been described in literature before, yet mainly in the closely related pathogen N. meningitidis and were verified to be immunogenic in N. gonorrhoeae as full-length proteins within this study: NGO1043 [51] , NGO1656 [48] and NGO1852 [46] .

Notably, the non-coding part included three stop codons and the immunogenic character was only validated for downstream NGO1656. Packaging with Hyperphage leads to an enrichment of open reading frames (ORF) [40] . Inserts with stop codons and out-of-frame arrangements are largely removed as infectious phage particles are only obtained if the coded sequence of insert and gIII is expressed as a full-length fusion protein. Since the insert also contained a start codon and signal peptide of NGO1656 according to SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) it is most likely that only the sequence coding for NGO1656 was translated into a fusion protein with the phage coat protein pIII followed by periplasmic translocation in E. coli and phage assembly. Hence, the NGO1657 derived oligopeptide may not have been displayed on the selected phage clone and selection was due to the display of only NGO1656 explaining the full-length protein of NGO1657 to fail the proof of immunogenicity in ELISA.

Furthermore, virulence-associated proteins were identified such as NGO0326 and NGO1577 increasing the likelihood of discovering virulence-associated factors among the identified proteins. Particularly NGO1634 will be further examined. Additional analyses for further characterisation of these immunogenic proteins will be conducted. Careful attention will be put on epitope mapping. Moreover, additional studies will be necessary to confirm the immunogenic character of the identified proteins also in-vivo. Furthermore, recombinant antibodies against selected proteins will be generated to further assist in characterising the identified proteins. Finally, the identified proteins in this work might be suitable targets for the development of novel therapeutic measures against N. gonorrrhoeae and could provide crucial information for a better understanding of gonococcal infection.",

The real-time PCR was run on a Roche Light-Cycler 2.0 using the following program: 95\u00b0C 10 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 15 s, 50\u00b0C 30 s, 72\u00b0C 30 s with a single data acquisition after the elongation step. Additionally, a melting curve was recorded starting at 95\u00b0C with 0.05\u00b0C/s slope decreasing to 45\u00b0C and continuous fluorescence acquisition (data not shown). The primers which were used for real-time PCR are listed in Table 3 .",

Signal peptides were predicted using SignalP 4.1 [95] . 3-dimensional structures were predicted using I-TASSER [60] . All models were selected based upon their C-score, which is a confidence score used by I-TASSER to estimate the quality of the predicted models. The C-score is usually in a range between -5 and 2. A Cscore with a higher value represents a model with a high confidence and vice-versa. Models were visualized using Chimera [96] .Model reliability was additionally checked by QMEAN [64] . A summary of available homologue structures was obtained by running PSI-BLAST (3 iterations) against the PDB database (S1 Table) . Evaluation of results was performed by Microsoft Excel and OriginPro 9.1 G (Originlab).",
