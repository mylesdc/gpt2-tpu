Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed (\u2265 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to infection, with IFN-\u03b3 as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/-129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the additional type I IFNdependent genes that we discovered may also be important for protection against MHV infection.",

Induction of type I interferons (IFNs), a well-known subset of cytokines with antiviral activity, is triggered by a selection of cellular pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs (Toll-like receptors), RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5). These receptors are activated in response to a range of pathogenspecific factors, which includes double-stranded RNA produced during virus infection [1, 2] . Secreted type I IFNs (i.e. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), subsequently induce an antiviral transcription program in the infected cell as well as in adjacent cells, thereby magnifying the \"danger\" signal and protecting against the infection.",

A number of studies has shown that CoVs, like the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, are poor inducers of type I IFNs in cell culture, and even escape from detection by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Consistently, virus-encoded IFN antagonistic functions have been described for both MHV and SARS-CoV [9, 10] . In vivo, however, MHV infection appeared to induce the production of IFN-\u03b1 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by a TLR7-dependent mechanism [11] . Moreover, MHV infections of primary neuronal cultures and of the central nervous system (CNS) induced IFN-\u03b2 gene expression, indicating that the production of type I IFNs in vivo is not limited to pDCs [12, 13] . Furthermore, neuronal cultures infected with MHV exhibited increased expression of several type I IFNinduced transcription factors [14] . More recently, Roth-Cross and co-workers reported that macrophages and macrophage-like microglia cells produce IFN-\u03b2 in the CNS of MHV-infected mice in a MDA5-dependent manner [15] .",

From these data we were able to identify host genes, the increased expression (\u2265 1.5 fold) of which could already be detected at day 2 (i.e. early genes; Figure 1C ) or only at day 5 (i.e. late genes; Figure 1D ). The group of earlyinduced transcripts contained many IFN-inducible genes, including the well-known interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1), and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (Oas) genes (Additional file 1A).

We also included known interactors of our hits in this analysis, while proteins that did not demonstrate any known interactions were excluded for clarity. The results are shown in Figure 2A and 2B. Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the \"early\" genes revealed two main modules. One module contained several proteins involved in antigen presentation, while the other module contained numerous proteins involved in the type I IFN response. The key player in this latter module appeared to be Irf7, which is the master regulator of type I IFN-dependent responses [23] . Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the \"late\" genes revealed a large network of proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions. Although the microarray analyses did not reveal the induction of IFN-\u03b3 gene expression itself, IFN-\u03b3 appeared at a central position in the network. In addition, the induction of a type I IFN response was also evident from this network as demonstrated by the presence of the transcription factors Irf1 and Irf8, both of which demonstrated elevated mRNA levels upon MHV infection. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that MHV infection induces a robust IFN response both at 2 and 5 days post infection, in which the transcription factors Irf7, Irf1, and Irf8 appear to be the key players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent.",

In agreement with the microarray expression profiles, significant induction of these type I and II IFNs could only be detected in the MHV-infected BALB/c animals ( Figure 1E ). The observation that the BALB/c mice, unlike the 129SvEv mice, exhibited abundant expression of IFN-responsive genes upon MHV infection appears counter intuitive as the 129SvEv mice are much more resistant to the infection than the BALB/c mice. Apparently, the resistance of 129SvEv mice to MHV infection is not controlled by a more robust IFN response. The reason for the observed difference in susceptibility between the different mouse strains after intranasal inoculation is not known. MHV-A59 was recently shown to replicate efficiently in the liver of 129SvEv mice after intraperitoneal inoculation [11] . Interestingly, the resistance of 129SvEv mice after intranasal inoculation is not restricted to infection with MHV, as it was also observed for vesicular stomatitis virus [24] . The microarray expression profiles described above suggested that the induction of an IFN response correlates with the viral load within the brain. To confirm this, we examined the data of the individual BALB/c mice at 5 days post infection in more detail. Clearly, the animals with the highest viral loads (mouse 2 and 4; Figure 3A ), also dis-played significantly higher levels of induction of type I and II IFN expression ( Figure 3B ). Likewise, the amplitude of the gene expression profiles ( Figure 3C and Additional file 2) of the individual mice also correlated with the viral loads in the brain. These observations are in agreement with results obtained by the profiling of SARS-CoVinfected macaques [25] . Also in that study a positive correlation between virus load and the induction of gene expression was observed. A few genes (n = 6), including ISG20, showed an inverse correlation with the viral load. We currently have no explanation for this observation as expression of ISG20 is known to be induced by type I IFNs [26, 27] . Interestingly, ISG20 has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against other viruses [28, 29] .",

Indeed, when these mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 of MHV-A59, viral RNA levels in their brains became much higher than in animals from the parental strain at 5 days post infection ( Figure 4A ). Interestingly, at this time point the viral RNA levels in the IFNAR-/-mice were comparable to those in the brains of the BALB/c mice. However, efficient dissemination of the infection, resulting in high viral loads in the liver as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, was only observed in the IFNAR-/-mice and not in the wild-type mice, which displayed viral RNA levels just above background ( Figure  4B ).

In contrast, at day 2, hardly any alterations in gene expression could be detected in these knock-out mice (Additional file 3). Figure 4C shows an expression-based cluster analysis of these 73 genes for the wild-type and IFNAR-/mice. Comparison of the complete expression profiles of these mice revealed that the transcriptional profile at day 5 in the IFNAR-/-mice has a larger similarity with the profile at day 2 of the parental 129SvEv mice than with that of the knock-out mice at day 2 post infection ( Figure 4C ). This observation may suggest the presence of an early host response to infection with MHV in the parental mice, even though no significant induction (\u2265 1.5 fold) of gene expression could be detected ( Figure 1B) . Such a response, may not be evident in transcriptional profiles of whole organs, but might only be apparent at the cellular level. We speculate that early decisive events are happening in initial target cell populations such as DCs and macro-Early and late transcriptional responses to infection with MHV As the knock-out mice lack a functional type I IFN receptor, the upregulation of gene expression observed in these mice apparently occurs independently of type I IFN signalling. Not much is known yet about type I IFN-independent responses to infection. The observation that the transcriptional upregulation of Irf1 was independent of type I IFN signalling is consistent with the notion that IFN-\u03b3 can also induce expression of this gene [32,33]. The type I IFN receptor-independent expression profile within the brains of IFNAR-/-mice after MHV infection Likewise, we also observed increased transcription of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 independent of type I IFN signalling, again corresponding with the literature [34, 35] . Interestingly, the expression of various genes encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation (i.e. H2, B2m, Psmb8, Psmb9, and Ctss) was also increased in the absence of type I IFN signalling. Psmb8 and Psmb9 encode immunoproteasome subunits which facilitate antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells after virus infection, a process that is primarily regulated by IFN-\u03b3 [36] . Furthermore, also the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) invariant chain, also called CD74 [37], was increased upon infection of the knock-out mice. These data are in agreement with the observation that the induction of genes involved in antigen processing is independent of STAT1 activation by . We also observed the transcriptional upregulation of the 3 isoforms of metallothionein (Mt1, Mt2, and Mt3), which encode proteins known to scavenge toxic metals [39] . The induction of these genes, which was not apparent in either wild-type mice, could reflect an acute-phase reaction in the brain of MHV-infected IFNAR-/-mice, which likely contributes to pathogenesis as has been shown for other viruses [40-42].",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that MHV [11, 15, 17] as well as several other viruses [48-50] replicate to much higher levels (up to 10 5 fold difference) in IFNAR-/-mice than in their wild-type counterparts. In this study we show that a strong correlation exists between the amplitude of type I and II IFN host responses with the viral load. The huge differences in virus replication between wild-type and IFNAR-/-mice therefore do not permit a fair comparison between gene expression profiles of these mice, with the aim of identifying type I IFN-dependent responses. Indeed, as no significant gene expression is observed in the wild-type 129SvEv mice, a comparison with the expression profile of the IFNAR-/-mice only provides information about type I IFN-independent and not IFNdependent responses. We now observe, in agreement with our previous study, that the brain of BALB/c and IFNAR-/ -129SvEv mice contain very similar MHV loads at day 2 and 5 post infection [17] . Since the type I IFN-responsive pathway is very well conserved among many different species [51], we considered it acceptable to compare the gene expression profiles of these mice with the aim of identifying type-I IFN-dependent responses, although comparing transcriptional profiles of wild-type and IFNAR-/-mice from a different genetic background should obviously be done very cautiously. Ideally, a comparison between wildtype BALB/c and IFNAR-/-BALB/c mice would have been more accurate. While the induced expression of a number of genes was similar for the two mouse strains (i.e. type I IFN signalling-independent gene-expression), that of other genes was only observed in the BALB/c mice (i.e. tentative type I IFN signalling-dependent gene expression). The expression of yet other genes appeared to be partially dependent of type I IFN signalling: increased expression of these genes was observed in the IFNAR-/mice, but much more so in the BALB/c mice.",

Genes, the transcriptional upregulation of which was at least 2 times higher in the BALB/c mice than in the IFNAR-/-mice, were also added to the list of tentative type I IFN-dependent genes. As expected, this set of genes (n = 82) contained many known IFN-responsive genes like Isg20, Ifit1, Ifit3, Isgf3g, Mx2 and Ube1l (Additional file 4). Functional association network analyses showed Irf1 and Irf7 to be the key players in the network (Additional file 5). Several of the tentative type I IFN-dependent genes (including Mx2 and Ube1l) have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections [52-56]. We speculate that other genes present in this list may also be important for full protection against MHV infection.",

BALB/c and 129SvEv mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS (control) or with MHV-A59. At day 2 and 5, mice (n = 4) were sacrificed and the brains and livers were harvested. The PBS-groups (n = 4) were also sacrificed at 5 days post inoculation. (A) Viral RNA (vRNA) levels within the brain were determined at 5 days post inoculation by quantitative RT-PCR targeting MHV-specific sequences. Standard deviations are indicated (*P < 0.0001). (B) Microarray analysis was performed as described in the Material & Methods section. The PBS-inoculated BALB/c or 129SvEv mice were taken as reference. Based on the significant alterations in gene expression (\u2265 1.5 fold change cut-off) within the brains of BALB/c mice at 5 days post infection, a cluster analysis (standard correlation) was performed resulting in the indicated gene tree (n = 121). The different conditions (i.e. mouse strains and day post infection) are indicated. (C-D) From the the gene tree shown in panel B, clusters representing \"early\" and \"late\" genes could be identified. For detailed information see the text and Additional file 1. (E) The IFN-\u03b14, IFN-\u03b21, and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The fold changes after infection with MHV relative to the PBS-inoculated animals are shown.
