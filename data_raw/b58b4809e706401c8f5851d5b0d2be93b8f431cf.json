            "text": "Bats have been proposed as major reservoirs for diverse emerging infectious viral diseases, with rabies being the best known in Europe. However, studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce. This study completes our active surveillance work on Spanish bat colonies that began in 1992. Herein, we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies. Between 2001 and 2011, we collected and tested 2,393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species. The results for dead confirmed the presence of EBLV-1 RNA in six species analyzed (for the first time in Myotis capaccinii). Samples positive for European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1)-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species, seven of which were found for the first time (even in Myotis daubentonii, a species to date always linked to EBLV-2). EBLV-1 seroprevalence (20.7%) ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed, with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer (July). EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness. Higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies, suggesting that intra-and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for EBLV-1 transmission in bat colonies. Although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines EBLV-1 variability, we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in batspecies seroprevalence. The results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding EBLV-1-prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials.",

Indeed, bats were shown to be involved in several emergent viral diseases (Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses, Astroviruses, and Adenoviruses etc.), with rabies being one of them [1] , [2] . Numerous bat species have been found to be infected by lyssaviruses [3] and bats serve as the reservoirs of 10 of the 11 Lyssavirus species described, suggesting that the lyssaviruses originated in these mammals and progressively diverged from a common ancestor [4] , [5] . Two new recently described tentative of the three novel Lyssavirus species further enlarged the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses found in bats [6] [7] [8] . In Europe, two Lyssavirus species, European bat Lyssavirus Types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, respectively), and one tentative species, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, circulate among several bat species [7] . EBLV-1 is widely distributed throughout Europe and two variants have distinct distributions and evolutionary histories: one is EBLV-1a, which has an east-west distribution from Russia to France, with very little genetic variation; and the other is EBLV-1b, which exhibits a south-north distribution and far more genetic diversity [9] .",

Few data are available on the infection incidence in other European bat species. However, active surveillance indicated that several other bat species has serological evidence of previous infection. The role of these species in EBLV-1 epidemiology, particularly Lyssavirus cross-species-infection dynamics, remains unknown. Given the fact that E. serotinus is a non-migratory bat [15] , it is possible that migratory species may have a more important role in the dispersion [16] , [17] and distribution of the different EBLV-1 genetic variants. With the aim of understanding more about the role of the different bat species in EBLV-1 dynamics and identifying ecological factors that might favor EBLV-1 transmission and, consequently, serological responses to infection in bat colonies, active surveillance of bat colonies in Spain was implemented in 1992. In this study, we analyzed ecological and epidemiological factors that might be associated with the infection dynamics observed in colonies where we previously detected EBLV-1 infection [17] [18] [19] , and completed with data collected during 2001-2010.",

Solitary individuals, mostly of the Rhinolophus genus, were not considered in species richness. Sibling species, such as Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii, and Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, were assimilated to form two groups due to the difficulty of identifying them when they were not captured.

Although the model with one interaction was a little better, we retained the first model without interaction to explain the EBLV-1-seroprevalence variation because it did not differ significantly from the former and it was more parsimonious. The results obtained with the best model indicated that EBLV-1 seroprevalence varied widely among months, with July having highest seroprevalence. Seroprevalence also differed among the taxon, with the Vespertilionidae family having the highest EBLV-1 seroprevalence, compared to other families, that was significantly higher than those of Rhinolophidae and Molossidae families (McNemar test, p,0.001 for both).",

The high percentage (65%) of seropositive species found suggests that most Spanish species of bats can be exposed to EBLV-1 (Table 1) . Even EBLV-1 neutralizing antibodies were identified in M. daubentonii, a species so far linked only to EBLV-2 infection in more northern parts of Europe [40] , [42] , [44] (Table 3) . Furthermore, evidence of EBLV-1 infection was found in 68% of the bat colonies sampled.

Our results showed that EBLV-1 seroprevalence varied broadly among the bat species and localities sampled. Previous studies demonstrated that bat Lyssavirus dynamics exhibited a strong seasonal pattern [25] and that the breeding period could favor bat infection [26] . This seasonal variability was also detected by our model, which indicated significantly higher EBLV-1 seroprevalence in summer (July), when maternity colonies are present in most of the localities. The model that includes the variable sex was not better than the best model (without sex), suggesting that sex-ratio changes observed during the year did not influence EBLV-1 seroprevalence.",

This variability might be explained by different susceptibilities to infection or immunological responses of the bat species to EBLV-1 virus. For example, we observed important differences between two species from two families: R. ferrumequinum had the highest percentage of positive clots and organs compared to other species, e.g., M. myotis, while the percentage of seropositive R. ferrumequinum was much lower than that of M. myotis. Our results are less in favor of the hypothesis of the difference in susceptibility because R. ferrumequinum bats were infected (nRT-PCR-positive in this study). These differences might rather suggest different seroconversion rates in these two species. In this sense, Turmelle et al. [45] reported that significant differences in seroconversion probabilities were found among bats depending on whether they had previously been infected, suggesting that long-term repeated infections of bats might confer significant immunological memory and reduced susceptibility to rabies infection. Immune competence in bats can vary with body condition (via nutritional status and stress) and reproductive activity and, as a consequence, can lead to a lower rabies seroprevalence between or within bat species [26] , [46] , [47] .",

            "text": "Our analyses revealed that the colony size and species richness it harbored were two important ecological factors and showed their relevant roles in seroprevalence variability. Notably, EBLV-1 seroprevalence and the colony size, especially large colonies, had a strong positive association. Previous studies suggested that larger colony size could also raise host density and simultaneously favor contact rates between individuals and, hence, the probability of infection spread [49] [50] [51] . However, colony size alone could not explain all the variability observed, especially when the colonies were comprised principally of one species, suggesting that other factors might be involved in bat seroprevalence. In this sense, Streicker et al. [52] showed that rabies virus (RABV) seroprevalence in common vampire bats was independent of bat-colony size. The absence of a relationship between RABV seroprevalence and colony size in that study could be explained by Desmodus rotundus generally forming small-or medium-sized monospecific colonies. Our results suggested that EBLV-1 seroprevalence was strongly affected by the colony size and species richness, and indicated that multispecies, large colonies, especially those with three or more different bat species, had a higher probability of EBLV-1 infection (Figure 2 ). Large colonies and multispecies associations occurred frequently among cave-dwelling bats, principally during the maternity period. This colonial behavior confers thermodynamic and social advantages to reproductive females during pregnancy and lactation [53] . Higher seroprevalence was observed in multispecies colonies compared to monospecific colonies, suggesting that interspecific virus transmission plays an important role in EBLV-1 dynamics. A higher number of species might not only increase the rates of contact between bat groups but could also facilitate virus entry or spread through the higher mobility of individuals among colonies, especially if there are migratory species. Cross et al [54] showed that the probability of a pandemic event depended on the interaction between colony size and movement of hosts among groups during their infectious lifetime. They suggested that large groups and frequent movements were more heavily impacted by acute diseases than hosts with small groups and infrequent movement. This could explain the high EBLV-1 seroprevalence observed in large multispecific colonies comprising M. schreibersii and, sometimes, M. capaccinii, both species being considered regionally migratory [15] . Indeed, these species migrate seasonally a few hundred kilometers [55] , [56] , and even between Balearic Islands [19] . This migratory behavior can be important for EBLV-1 dispersion within colonies or among localities at local and regional scales [17] .",

In accordance with our results, this species might be less exposed to lyssavirus than cave-dwelling bats because it colonizes buildings and its colonies are often monospecific, small, highly philopatric. These observations could be indicative of a low public health risk associated with P. pipistrellus.",
