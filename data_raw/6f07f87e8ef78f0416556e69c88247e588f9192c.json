Phylogenetic analyses showed the conservation of potential three-stemmed pseudoknots in the frameshift signals of all other coronaviruses in the GenBank database. Though the presence of the three-stemmed structure is supported by nuclease mapping and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies, our findings suggest that interactions between the stem structures may result in local distortions in the A-form RNA. These distortions are particularly evident in the vicinity of predicted A-bulges in stems 2 and 3. In vitro and in vivo frameshifting assays showed that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is functionally similar to other viral frameshift signals: it promotes efficient frameshifting in all of the standard assay systems, and it is sensitive to a drug and a genetic mutation that are known to affect frameshifting efficiency of a yeast virus. Mutagenesis studies reveal that both the specific sequences and structures of stems 2 and 3 are important for efficient frameshifting. We have identified a new RNA structural motif that is capable of promoting efficient programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The high degree of conservation of three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot structures among the coronaviruses suggests that this presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics.

The rapid response of the World Health Organization is credited with containing this contagion by late June 2003, and only a few cases were reported during the winter cold season of [2003] [2004] . The severity of this crisis mobilized the scientific community as well: by March 24, 2003 , scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in Hong Kong had announced that a new coronavirus had been isolated from patients with SARS (reviewed in [1] ).

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped animal viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases. Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, the 70% (approximately) at the 59 end of its large single (\u00fe) stranded RNA genome consists of two sizable genes called ORF1a and ORF1b. The 39 ORF1b overlaps, and is out of frame with, its 59 neighbor, ORF1a, and similar to other coronaviruses, a programmed \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift (\u00c01 PRF) was posited to be used by the virus to produce an ORF1a/1b fusion protein [2] . A wide range of RNA viruses use \u00c01 PRF for the production of viral fusion protein (reviewed in [4] [5] [6] ). In many such cases, e.g., the Retroviridae and Totiviridae, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting determines the stoichiometric ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins available for viral particle assembly, and even small changes in frameshift frequencies can have profound negative effects on virus propagation, thus targeting \u00c01 PRF for antiviral therapies (reviewed in [7] ). It has been shown that the SARS-Cov \u00c01 PRF signal is able to promote efficient frameshifting in a rabbit reticulcyte system, and the \u00c01 PRF signal reported in that publication consisted of a typical heptameric ''slippery site'' (UUUAAAC), a 5-nt spacer, and a typical Hform mRNA pseudoknot containing two double-stranded RNA stems and two single-stranded loops [8] . Two very recently published papers have suggested that the SARS-CoV mRNA pseudoknot may contain a third stem-loop structure [9, 10] . In this work, we present computational, comparative genomic, molecular, biophysical, and genetic evidence demonstrating that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal includes a new type of highly ordered three-stemmed mRNA pseudo-knot that likely contains a large number of noncanonical base interactions. Although total deletion of the third stem does not significantly alter frameshifting efficiency, its disruption significantly inhibits this process. The fact that this general structure appears to be conserved among the coronaviruses raises questions regarding its biological function.",

The nucleotide sequence suspected of featuring a \u00c01 PRF signal between ORF1a and ORF1b was scanned by RNAMotif [12] , using a pattern-based description capable of finding common \u00c01 PRF signals in other RNA viruses. As expected, a so-called slippery site (UUUAAAC) and a large H-type pseudoknot were identified-the two primary stimulating elements required for efficient ribosomal slippage. This analysis was coupled with Pknots [13] , a software package that predicts the most thermodynamically stable structure for a given RNA sequence. The predicted structure for the SARS-CoV frameshift signal was extremely stable, with a calculated minimum free energy (MFE) of \u00c026.68 kcal/mol. The surprising result was that the 29nt sequence designated loop 2 by Thiel et al. [8] was predicted to form a third helix, nested within the sequences defined by stems 1 and 2 ( Figure 1B) . Though a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14] , such an extensive basepairing pattern has not to our knowledge been heretofore demonstrated for any other viral frameshift signal. To determine the statistical significance of this finding, a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. Each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. The resulting normal distribution had mean MFE of \u00c021.12 kcal/mol (standard deviation = 2.67, 5003), revealing that the predicted three-stemmed pseudoknot structure of the native sequence is highly significant with a z-score of \u00c02.05 and a p value of 0.02 (one-tailed Student's t-test).",

The SARS-CoV frameshift signal itself is homologous to all of the nine other frameshift signals for coronaviruses whose genomes have been fully sequenced. A multiple sequence alignment of the ten coronavirus frameshift signals is presented in Figure 2 . This shows that both stems 1 and 2 are highly conserved, with a strong conservation of base complementation in the cores of both stems 1 and 2 (blue and red sequences, respectively). This analysis also shows all of the coronavirus frameshift signals have the potential to form a third helix, although the structures and sequences are less well conserved ( Figure 2 , in green). In addition, the potential of sequences located approximately 200 nt downstream of the slippery site to form long-range ''kissing loop'' interactions with the 59 half of stem 2 was previously noted for HCoV-229E [16] and TEGV [17] . This property was only conserved among all of the group 2 coronaviruses, not in any of the others (see Figure 2 ). The potential significance of this observation is discussed below. A phylogenetic tree of the \u00c01 PRF signals constructed from the multiple sequence alignment is presented in Figure 3 . As expected, the group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses cluster together, and neither the SARS-CoV nor the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) frameshift signals cluster with either group. Of particular interest, however, is that very similar In light of the computational findings, we conducted biochemical analyses of the SARS-CoV frameshift signal using a [ 32 P] 59 end labeled SP6 RNA polymerase product spanning nucleotides 13399-13475. RNase A cleaves preferentially at single-stranded pyrimidine bases, RNase T1 cuts at single-stranded guanosine residues, and RNase V1 cleaves double-stranded RNA. We also examined alkaline hydrolysis cleavage patterns at low concentrations of sodium hydroxide to identify exposed phosphodiester bonds. Representative autoradiograms of the reactions are shown in Figure 4A and 4B, and the predicted cleavage patterns mapped onto the pseudoknot structure are shown in Figure 4C .",

Some notable deviations from the predicted structure were observed, however. These fell into three general classes. One class consisted of distortions in predicted helical A-RNA structures, typified by bases that were equally digested by both single-and double-strand-specific nucleases and by nearby bases that were refractory to nuclease attack. These clustered in the middle of stem 1 (13406-13410 and 13427), near the middle of stem 2 (13419-13420), and in the middle of stem 3 (13436-13439 and 13458-13461). Another major group consisted of bases located in regions predicted to link the three stems that were completely protected from nuclease attack. Specifically, these were G13405 and G13435 at the stem 1/stem 3 junction, G13414 and G13423-C13425 at the stem 1/stem 2 junction, and C13463 and U13464, which link stem 2 with stem 3. We also observed enhanced susceptibility of the three pyrimidines in the predicted loop 2 region (C13447, U13448, and U13451) to attack by both single-and double-strand-specific endonucleases, suggesting that this region is structurally dynamic under the conditions assayed. The ability of the bulged adenosine residue at position 13467 to be recognized by RNaseV1 demonstrates that it is involved in a basepairing interaction, whereas the opposite pertains with regard to A13446, A13452, and A13456. The three bases at the 59 and 39 terminal ends of the molecule could not be meaningfully resolved.",

In this study, we have obtained sequential imino 1 H and 15 N assignments for the A-form helices of the frameshifting SARS pseudoknot, using a combination of information from 1 H, 1 H-NOE and 1 H, 15 N-HMQC spectra. The latter experiment distinguishes between uridine and guanosine iminos by the characteristic 15 N Assignments were made for 8 bp in stem 1, 4 bp in stem 2, and 5 bp in stem 3 ( Figure 5 ). As a result of fraying, the terminal basepairs of helical stem regions are not observed. Of those basepairs assigned, 16 are Watson-Crick-type basepairs and only one is a canonical wobble G:U basepair. This G:U basepair present in stem 3 can be inferred directly from the strong NOE correlation between the G38 and U59 imino protons ( Figure 5C ). The corresponding donor G38:N1 and U59:N3 imino nitrogens are evidently not engaged in G:C or U:A hydrogen bonds ( Figure 5D ).",

As a minor modification, instead of using a simple readthrough construct as the zero-frame control, the corresponding control contained the SARS-CoV \u00c01 PRF signal with one additional base inserted 39 of the Renilla luciferase sequence and 59 of the \u00c01 PRF signal. The resulting zero-frame reporter places the firefly luciferase ORF in frame with Renilla and inactivates the \u00c01 PRF signal by moving it out of frame with regard to elongating ribosomes, while controlling for ribosomes dislodged from the reporter mRNAs by the mRNA pseudoknot. This seemed to alleviate the large errors observed by other groups using similar methodology (e.g., [9] ).",

The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 6A . In vitro, the SARS-CoV sequence was able to promote efficient \u00c01 PRF in both wheat germ protoplasts (23.7% 6 1.9%) and rabbit reticulocytes (14.3% 6 3.7%). In vivo, the sequence was able to promote efficient \u00c01 PRF in the Vero epithelial cell line (14.4% 6 0.6%), a finding that is important in light of the fact that the SARS-CoV infects lung epithelial cells. The sequence also promoted efficient \u00c01 PRF in yeast cells, suggesting that this frameshift signal might be amenable to the molecular genetic toolbox available in the yeast system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of a drug (anisomycin) and of a host cell mutant (mak8-1) that were previously shown to specifically affect L-A virusdirected \u00c01 PRF in yeast cells [20] [21] [22] . The results of these experiments show that, similar to their effects on L-Apromoted \u00c01 PRF, anisomycin was able to inhibit SARS-CoVdirected \u00c01 PRF (21% inhibition, p = 5.04 3 10 \u00c08 ), whereas \u00c01 PRF was stimulated in cells harboring the mak8-1 allele of RPL3 (25% stimulation, p = 5.0 3 10 \u00c05 ) ( Figure 6B ). These findings show that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is amenable to analysis by the full array of yeast-based genetic, pharmacological, and molecular tools that we and others have developed. Interestingly, the absolute values for frameshifting in yeast (2.99% 6 0.06%) were significantly less than those observed in the other systems (ranging from approximately 15% to 25%), suggestive of differences between fungal and metazoan ribosomes that might be pharmacologically exploited.

            "text": "Six different stem 2 mutants were assayed for their ability to promote efficient \u00c01 PRF (Figure 7 ). Not surprisingly, disruption of stem 2 (S2A and S2A9) precluded efficient \u00c01 PRF. Unexpectedly, however, compensatory mutations that should promote re-formation of the basic stem 2 structure (S2B9) did not restore wild-type levels of frameshifting, suggesting the involvement of a primary mRNA sequence in this region in stimulating \u00c01 PRF. However, the adenosine base at position 13465 in this construct had to be replaced with a guanosine to avoid creating a \u00c01 frame termination codon. Though this substitution retains the potential to basepair with U13424, it is possible that the identity of the base at this position is critical. To examine this parameter, the base at this position was changed to guanosine in the context of an otherwise wild-type \u00c01 PRF signal (A13465G). Though this mutation did not abrogate efficient \u00c01 PRF, frameshifting efficiency was decreased by approximately 38% (p = 1.7 3 10 \u00c06 ). This result suggests that though this mutation was not the main cause of the dramatic reduction in \u00c01 PRF observed with S2B9, the identity of the base at this position is important for maximizing \u00c01 PRF efficiency. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that both the general structure and base-specific sequence of stem 2 are required for efficient \u00c01 PRF. (B) SARS-CoV-directed \u00c01 PRF was monitored in wild-type yeast cells with or without anisomycin (20 lg/ml), or in isogenic RPL3 gene deletion cells expressing either the wild-type or mak8-1 alleles of RPL3 on an episomal plasmid [21] . Changes in \u00c01 PRF efficiencies are shown as fold wild-type, and p-values are shown as described previously [25] . DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030172.g006",

Two constructs were assayed to examine the requirement of the bulged residue at position 13467 for efficient \u00c01 PRF. In mutant S2C9, A13467 was substituted with cytosine, whereas in construct S2C, the adenosine at position 13467 was removed from the middle of stem 2 and repositioned six bases downstream to maintain translational reading frame. Either replacing the A-bulge with cytosine (S2C9) or deleting it entirely (S2C) dramatically reduced frameshifting in Vero cells (.94%, p , 3.3 3 10 \u00c016 ), repressing \u00c01 PRF to a similar extent as the mutants S2A, S2A9, and S2B9. Similar to the approach described above, five mutants were constructed to investigate stem 3 (Figure 7 ). Constructs S3A, S3A9, S3B, and S3C9 were directed toward addressing the function of stem 3: in S3A, the guanine and cytosine residues in the 59 half of stem 3 were mutated to cytosine and guanine, respectively, disrupting stem 3; the opposing mutations were made in the 59 half of stem 3 in S3A9; and S3B harbored the compensatory mutations to allow re-formation of stem 3. Frameshifting with S3A was reduced by 68% (p = 2.61 3 Constructs used to examine the contributions of stem structures and bulged adenosine residues to programmed \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting are depicted. Shading is used to indicate mutagenized bases.

Similar to the effects observed in stem 2, the presence of compensatory mutations in construct S3B did not rescue \u00c01 PRF efficiency to near wild-type levels, again suggesting that both the general structure of stem 3 and specific sequences within it are required for maximal stimulation of \u00c01 PRF.",

In addition, as no significant internal nested stems have been observed in other viral frameshift pseudoknots, and because deletion of sequence corresponding to this region did not dramatically affect \u00c01 PRF in AIBV [27] , the entire stem 3-forming region was deleted in construct DS3 to create a more typical two-stemmed H-type RNA pseudoknot.

There were some notable contrasts, however: though the S2C9 and S2C constructs dramatically reduced frameshifting in Vero cells (95%), they only reduced \u00c01 PRF by approximately 25%-33% in yeast. More strikingly, some of the mutations that resulted in a 25%-30% decrease in \u00c01 PRF in Vero cells (A13465G, S3B, and S3C9) did not affect the overall rate of \u00c01 PRF in yeast at all.

Here, the coronaviruses have again revealed a new twist on mRNA pseudoknots and \u00c01 PRF. The phylogenetic comparisons presented in this study reveal that stem 1 lengths and G:C compositions are highly conserved in all ten coronavirus sequences analyzed. Their relatively long G:C-rich composition presumably contributes significantly to the stability of these structures. In contrast, stem 2 structures are predicted to vary significantly between the different coronavirus groups. Specifically, the group 2 coronaviruses (HCoV-043C, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV) have the longest and most stable predicted stem 2 structures, whereas the stem 2 regions of the group 1 coronaviruses (TGV, PDEV, HCoV-NL, and HCoV-229E) are anticipated to be the least stable. The stem 2 regions of SARS-CoV and AIBV appear to be intermediate between these two. Although the sequences in the stem 3/loop 3 region are not well conserved, a third stem independently predicted in the SARS-CoV \u00c01 PRF signal [10] has been demonstrated in this work, and we predict third stems in other coronavirus frameshift signals. Similar structures are generally predicted to be able to form within groups.",

Longrange interaction anchors mediated by adenosine residues such as those at positions 13456 (stem 3) and 13467 (stem 2), making contact with the shallow minor grooves of two stacked basepairs of A-form helical stems, are a recurring theme in RNA structural biology. For example, the crystal structure of the ribosome reveals that RNA has a remarkable propensity for contributing adenine bases to such A-minor interactions [31] , thereby stimulating the assembly of higherorder RNA structures [26] . Mounting evidence suggests that stimulation of \u00c01 PRF by mRNA pseudoknots requires specific noncanonical basepairing between helical stems and pseudoknot loop regions to set specifically required frameshift efficiencies. The structures of the few frameshiftpromoting pseudoknots that have been determined at the atomic level are revealing that a large range of higher-order noncovalent interactions serve to promote stable, novel structures [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . It is clear that the three-helix-containing mRNA pseudoknot described here represents a novel global architecture stimulating ribosomal frameshifting, and possibly a source of new structural motifs in the coming future. Experiments are currently underway to define this structure at the atomic level, using high-resolution NMR techniques. Elucidation of this novel mRNA structure will be of great utility in the rational development of therapeutic agents designed to interfere with SARS-CoV programmed \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting, and in furthering our understanding of how different pseudoknots stimulate translational recoding.",

For example, the findings that changing the identities of the bulged adenosine residues in stems 2 and 3 from adenosine to cytosine (S2C9 and S3C9), or deleting the bulge in stem 2 altogether (S2C), abrogated the stimulatory effects of the pseudoknot support the notion that this structural property of bulged adenosine residues is functionally important in this context. In addition, water-nucleobase ''stacking'' in the form of H-p and lone pair-p interactions have been demonstrated at the junctions between the stems in the BWYV pseudoknot [34] . The corresponding regions of the wild-type SARS-CoV pseudoknot were refractory to nuclease attack and were disrupted in S2A, S2A9, S2B9, S3, S3A9, and S3B, possibly explaining the effects of all of these mutants on frameshifting.

It may be that frameshifting levels in coronaviruses need to be regulated in a manner not supported by a two-stem pseudoknot. For example, the frameshift signal marks the boundary between proteins required during the immediate early phase of infection (e.g., ORF1a-encoded proteases used to prepare the cell for virus production) and those required for intermediate functions in the viral life cycle (i.e., ORF1b-encoded RNAdependent RNA polymerase and helicase used in transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, [\u00c0] strand synthesis, and genome replication). One of the fundamental problems of in the biology of (\u00fe) RNA viruses regards the switch between translation and replication. An elegant model proposes that the \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift in barley yellow dwarf virus plays a central role in remodeling the (\u00fe) strand from translation competent to replication competent: frameshifting enables synthesis of the replicase, which in turn is able to denature the frameshift-promoting cis-acting element, eventually clearing the (\u00fe) strand of ribosomes that could potentially block the replicase [23] . In coronaviruses, the idea of functional switching by RNA remodeling has been demonstrated for MHV [38] , and similar functional elements are present in both SARS-CoV and BCoV [39] .",

A subsequent report also found this potential motif in the TGV genome [17] . The phylogenetic analysis presented here reveals the potential to form similar short imperfect stem 2 structures for the other two group 1 coronaviruses for which the sequence is known (HCoV-NL and PEDV). In contrast, similar interactions cannot be readily discerned in SARS-CoV, nor among the group 2 and group 3 coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the idea that viral sequences in the pseudoknot may interact either in cis with sequences on the (\u00fe) strand or in trans with either sequences in subgenomic mRNAs or on the (\u00c0) strand to modulate frameshifting remains an intriguing possibility.",

This represents a potentially exciting avenue of exploration, as it may be indicative of mRNA folding differences between the two systems or of differences in how yeast versus metazoan ribosomes interact with downstream mRNA structures. This could be a result of relative size differences in the ribosomes. Alternatively, the lower levels of frameshifting in yeast relative to wild-type in the Vero cells could reflect a higher sensitivity of these ribosomes to subtle changes in the frameshift signal. The normal levels of frameshifting in yeast promoted by the S3B and S3C9 mutants further support the notion that the reason for stem 3 may lie with some function other than programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",

First, a pattern matching descriptor of known \u00c01 PRF signals was used in conjunction with RNAMotif [12] to identify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the frameshift signal's slippery site. Second, Pknots [13] was employed to ''fold'' the sequence immediately downstream (39) to the slippery site and to produce a predicted MFE value in kilocalories per mole for the sequence. The statistical significance of the predicted MFE value of the threestemmed RNA pseudoknot was tested by generating 500 randomly shuffled sequences derived from the native sequence, refolding each of these, and calculating their MFE values using Pknots. This resulted in a normal distribution of MFE values, against which the native sequence could be compared and z-scores calculated. FASTA3 v3.4 [40] was used to initially identify sequences homologous to the SARS \u00c01 PRF signal based on primary sequence similarity. The search space included 1,724 viral genome sequences downloaded using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Entrez Taxonomy Browser [41] . The resulting pairwise alignments produced by FASTA3 were used to produce a multiple-sequence alignment using ClustalW v1.82 [42] . An unrooted phylogenetic tree was created from this alignment and visualized using Tree View v1.6.6 [43] .",

The Renilla and firefly bicistronic elements were amplified by PCR using previously described primers [19] , SpeI-and XhoIdigested, and cloned into p416ADH [47] . One additional base was introduced after the BamHI restriction site, using the Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States) QuikChange XL kit to correct the reading frame.

A zero-frame control plasmid, pJD474, was constructed by adding one cytosine residue upstream of the BamHI restriction site of pJD465.

Imino resonances were assigned sequence-specificity from water flip-back, WATERGATE 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) [52] spectra (s mix = 200 ms), and a jump-return [53] 1 H, 15 N-heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) [54] . Elucidation of basepairing and secondary structure was verified from scalar 2h J(N,N) couplings through hydrogen bonds in the quantitative J(N,N) HNN correlation spectroscopy (COSY) data [55, 56] .",

(D) 2D Quantitative J(N,N) HNN-COSY spectrum showing interstrand 1 H3-15 N3(U) to 15 N1(A) and 1 H1-15 N1(G) to 15 N3(C) correlations. Data were collected on a uniformly 13 C/ 15 N-labeled sample. Red peaks correspond to diagonal resonances and are labeled with assignment information for the basepaired stem regions matching the color coding in (C). Green cross peaks are caused by scalar cross hydrogen bond 2h J(N,N) couplings detected using a defocusing delay of 36 ms. Carrier positions were on water for 1 H and 185 ppm.
