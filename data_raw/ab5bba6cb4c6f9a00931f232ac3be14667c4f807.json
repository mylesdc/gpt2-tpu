Scanning electron micrographs provided the morphology of these particles with observed sizes ranging from 10 to 50 nm, whilst FTIR spectra confirmed the absence of polar bonds and organic impurities, and strong Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 1604 and 1311 cm \u22121 ascribed to C-C vibrational motions were observed. Carbon signals that resonated at \u03b4 C 126 ppm in the solid state NMR spectra confirmed that sp 2 hybridised carbons were present in high concentration in two of the nanoparticle types (AMNP1 and AMNP2). X-ray powder diffraction suggested that AMNP0 contains single phase Tungsten carbide (WC) in a high state of purity and multiple phases of WC/WC 1-x were identified in both AMNP1 and AMNP2. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) analyses revealed and quantified the elemental ratios in these composite formulations. Nanomaterials 2017, 7, 152 2 of 16",

The findings assisted in the development of novel and innovative antimicrobial agents in an era of ever-increasing antimicrobial resistance. The potential of using nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents raised concerns about the possibility of nanoparticle toxicity on the central nervous system (CNS) [21] [22] [23] . In vivo investigation using hippocampus cells in young rats suggested an interactive connection between nano ZnO/Ag/CuO and the effectiveness of learning ability and the flexibility of cognition [21, [24] [25] [26] . Nevertheless, incremental nano-dosages increased the excitability in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons and confirmed a safety threshold of 0.05 wt % of injection suspension, which has provided an insight regarding the relative toxicity concern over the use of nanoparticles in biomedical engineering [27] [28] [29] . These findings proved the novelty of antimicrobial nanoparticles (AMNP) in a cost-effective fashion for inhibiting microbial growth, which may bring major changes in policy and new regulations on the wider uses of nanoparticles in biomedical healthcare [7, 16, 30] .",

Through the chemical investigation, we found that C, W, Ag, Cu, and O are the main elements contained in these AMNP formulations, and we also identified several phases present in these series (i.e., WC, WC 1\u2212x , CuO). By understanding the lattice structures and chemistry of these antimicrobial nanoparticle composites, we hope to identify biological surface-interactions between these ultra-small particles and the microbes. This will help in studying the reaction mechanisms involved in target bacterium or viruses, and will also help to design and create custom-made antimicrobial formulations in the future.",

            "text": "FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify the types of components (organic/inorganic/polymer) that may be contained in these nanoparticles. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies provided complimentary analyses to characterise the presence of intramolecular bonding in these composites. Four samples were investigated; this included the commercially available WC (<1 \u03bcm) from Alfa Aesear \u00ae (Lancashire, UK), AMNP0, AMNP1, and AMNP2. Figure 2a shows the vibration spectra of Alfa Aesar WC in both FTIR (top) and Raman (bottom) modes, while Figure 2b shows the two spectra obtained from AMNP0. Similarly Figure 3a ,b showed both FTIR and Raman vibration spectra of the AMNP1 and AMNP2 powder samples. The FTIR spectra of all four samples (top spectrum of Figures 2a,b and 3a ,b) showed only symmetrical stretches near the low frequency fingerprint region (500-1000 cm \u22121 ). No distinctive asymmetrical vibration stretches were observed in any of these samples, which suggested that these samples were clean of organic contaminants (i.e., C=O, CH, H2O). Upon detailed analysis of the Raman spectra acquired, additional composition information was obtained in line with the characteristic spectral profiles. In this regard, Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 265, 715, and 803 cm \u22121 observed in the AMNP0 spectrum ( Figure 2b ) coincide with those for the commercial WC sample [38] (Figure 2a ), associated to stretching vibrational motions of the WC triple bond. In turn, the Raman spectra for AMNP1 and AMNP2 (Figure 3a ,b) were observed to exhibit significant differences with respect to those of the commercial WC and AMNP0. In summary, clearly defined vibrational bands centred at ca. 1335/1298 and 1582/1597 cm \u22121 were observed for AMNP1/AMNP2, respectively, with the Raman active peaks at lower frequency associated with the so-called D-band characteristic of the A1g mode of diamond type carbon with sp 3 hybridisation. Thus, the vibrational bands at higher frequency were observed to be in agreement with the G vibrational band (E2g) characteristic of sp 2 hybridised graphitic carbon [38, 39] . The relative intensity of the D and G vibrational bands indicates a greater degree of graphitisation in AMNP2 [40] . In addition, Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 807, 716, and 272 cm \u22121 in the spectrum of AMNP1 (Figure 3a ) are consistent with the presence of WC (vide supra). In fact, these active Raman bands may also be present in AMNP2 (Figure 3b ), only it was swarmed by overlapping with other active signals due to the high complexity of the samples. Upon detailed analysis of the Raman spectra acquired, additional composition information was obtained in line with the characteristic spectral profiles. In this regard, Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 265, 715, and 803 cm \u22121 observed in the AMNP0 spectrum ( Figure 2b ) coincide with those for the commercial WC sample [38] (Figure 2a ), associated to stretching vibrational motions of the WC triple bond.

We were unable to obtain a 13 C signal from the commercial WC, however, this may be due to the paramagnetic effect caused by the presence of impurities in the commercial sample which was detected later from the XRD analysis. At present, there is insufficient NMR reports relating to metal carbides, whereas here we report the first 13 C-NMR resonance observed in a WC sample. The lack of NMR study in metal carbides is due to the lack of aliphatic carbon (CH) present in carbide ions and also the attribution of the sp hybridised carbon, which are known to largely reduce the sensitivity of detection. With the chosen parameters (10 s relaxation delay) applied to these NMR experiments, we were able to observed three active carbon chemical signals resonating at \u03b4C 123, 254, and 307 ppm (top spectrum in Figure 4 ) in the AMNP0 sample. The one that resonated at \u03b4C 123 ppm is typically associated with aromatic/graphitic/charcoal type of carbon. Whereas the other two deshielded resonances at \u03b4C 254 and 307 ppm indicated carbon environments that are less electronegative, which match the chemical property of a carbide type carbon [41] . In contrast, the signal observed at \u03b4C 254 ppm was indeed comparable to the NMR shifts observed in Scandium carbide Sc2C2 (\u03b4C 253 ppm) and Yttrium carbide Y2C2 (\u03b4C 257 ppm) reported by Yamazaki et al. [41] and Zhang et al. [42] . An exceedingly rare 13 C-NMR resonance published by Buss et al. [43] observed a carbon resonance exhibited at \u03b4C 546 ppm from a novel molybdenum carbide complex, thus the unusually sharp signal observed at \u03b4C 307 ppm could also be interpreted as a metal carbide resonance.

            "text": "Raman and FTIR spectra of (a) AMNP1 and (b) AMNP2. 13 C-NMR spectroscopy is probably one of the best techniques to analyse and study carbon environments. We were unable to obtain a 13 C signal from the commercial WC, however, this may be due to the paramagnetic effect caused by the presence of impurities in the commercial sample which was detected later from the XRD analysis. At present, there is insufficient NMR reports relating to metal carbides, whereas here we report the first 13 C-NMR resonance observed in a WC sample. The lack of NMR study in metal carbides is due to the lack of aliphatic carbon (CH) present in carbide ions and also the attribution of the sp hybridised carbon, which are known to largely reduce the sensitivity of detection. With the chosen parameters (10 s relaxation delay) applied to these NMR experiments, we were able to observed three active carbon chemical signals resonating at \u03b4C 123, 254, and 307 ppm (top spectrum in Figure 4 ) in the AMNP0 sample. The one that resonated at \u03b4C 123 ppm is typically associated with aromatic/graphitic/charcoal type of carbon. Whereas the other two deshielded resonances at \u03b4C 254 and 307 ppm indicated carbon environments that are less electronegative, which match the chemical property of a carbide type carbon [41] . In contrast, the signal observed at \u03b4C 254 ppm was indeed comparable to the NMR shifts observed in Scandium carbide Sc2C2 (\u03b4C 253 ppm) and Yttrium carbide Y2C2 (\u03b4C 257 ppm) reported by Yamazaki et al. [41] and Zhang et al. [42] . An exceedingly rare 13 C-NMR resonance published by Buss et al. [43] observed a carbon resonance exhibited at \u03b4C 546 ppm from a novel molybdenum carbide complex, thus the unusually sharp signal observed at \u03b4C 307 ppm could also be interpreted as a metal carbide resonance. The NMR investigations of AMNP1 and AMNP2 (Figure 4 ) are straight forward, and the only observable 13 C chemical shifts resonated at 126 ppm are again associated with the presence of graphene/graphite types of carbons in both samples. Such high aromatic carbon contents found in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 NMR studies support the hypothesis that was drawn from the previous Raman analyses.",

(Figures 9a and 10a) indicating that both AMNP1 and AMNP2 have a high concentration of sp 2 carbons [54, 55] . This feature is also supported by the broad and asymmetric tail towards high eV, hence, if the sample contains a high sp 3 concentration, the C1s peak will appear to be more symmetrical. Again the high content of graphitic carbon present in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 samples measured in the XPS analyses agrees with the results obtained from the corresponding Raman and NMR data reported earlier in Section 3.2. As shown in Figure 9b , several binding energies were measured at the W4f core in AMNP1. They all appeared as asymmetric doublets at 30/32 eV, 31.5/33.5 eV, and 32.5/35 eV, and these three sets of doublets are believed to be associated with the multiple phases of W identified in the XRD results (Table 1) . Metal Tungsten (W) has a reference XPS binding energy of 31.6/33.5 (doublet) and this W4f7/2/W4f5/2 feature in lost as the transition state of W changes to other W compounds (i.e., W2C/WC), hence eV shifts to higher energy are observed in the cases of both AMNP1 (Figure 9b ) and AMNP2 (Figure 10b ) [53] . Again, two sets of doublets in the W4f spectrum for AMNP2 (Figure 10b ) were measured at 32/33.2 eV and 32/34.2 eV, which suggest different phases of the W compounds (i.e., W and WC) are present in AMNP2.",

            "text": "Although Cu/CuO were not detected in AMNP1 during the XRD analysis, it was perhaps embedded beneath the particle surface. XPS analysis had clearly picked up a trace of Cu as observed in the Cu2p spectrum (Figure 9c ), in which the binding energy was measured at 932 \u00b1 1 eV as the etch level increased. Cu2p content was later quantified as 0.5% (Table 2 ) relative to the entire AMNP1 sample. Similar to the W4f core, significant split spin-orbit doublets (\u2206 = 19.75 eV) [53] were found in both XPS Cu2p spectra for AMNP1 ( Figure 9c ) and AMNP2 (Figure 10c ). In contrast, the Cu content (CuO as identified from the XRD analysis) measured at 932.8/952.6 eV in AMNP2 is substantially higher than those found in AMNP1. Similarly, a significant amount of Ag in AMNP2 was detected when compared to AMNP1, and Figures 9d and 10d represent the Ag3d spectra for AMNP1 and AMNP2, respectively. All of the Ag3d regions for both AMNP1 (368/374 eV) and AMNP2 (368/374 eV) samples, as expected, appeared as asymmetric doublets and have well separated spin-orbit components (\u2206 = 6.0 eV). Small shifts observed in these binding energies, particularly in AMNP1, may have been associated with the For AMNP0 (Figure 8 ), two binding energies at 285 and 283 eV (indicated in red in Figure 8a ) were initially measured in the C1s spectrum at the 0 s etch time. C1s binding energies were then subsequently stabilised from etch time 30 s onwards. As expected, AMNP0 gave only singlets at 283.4 eV in the C1s spectrum, which is ascribed with the metal carbide energy state [39] . Figure 8b shows the XPS W4f spectrum acquired from AMNP0, consistent binding energies (eV) at 32, 34 (4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 doublet), and 37 (5p 3/2 ) were measured throughout, and these signals again indicated the presence of the carbidic bonding associated with WC in the AMNP0 [53] . Figures 9 and 10 show the XPS energy profiles measured in AMNP1 and AMNP2. It is worth noting that the initial asymmetric peak at 284 eV with a tailed binding energy of 288 eV was found in both C1s spectra (Figures 9a and 10a) in AMNP1 and AMNP2. These are associated with the common adventitious carbon contaminant (according to Thermo Scientific instruments application note). These peaks were subsequently removed by applying Argon clusters and were not observed at the 30 s etch time and onwards. Multiple binding energies (satellite features) were measured between 183 and 285 eV in the C1s spectra (Figures 9a and 10a) indicating that both AMNP1 and AMNP2 have a high concentration of sp 2 carbons [54, 55] . This feature is also supported by the broad and asymmetric tail towards high eV, hence, if the sample contains a high sp 3 concentration, the C1s peak will appear to be more symmetrical. Again the high content of graphitic carbon present in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 samples measured in the XPS analyses agrees with the results obtained from the corresponding Raman and NMR data reported earlier in Section 3.2.",

Metal Tungsten (W) has a reference XPS binding energy of 31.6/33.5 (doublet) and this W4f 7/2 /W4f 5/2 feature in lost as the transition state of W changes to other W compounds (i.e., W 2 C/WC), hence eV shifts to higher energy are observed in the cases of both AMNP1 (Figure 9b ) and AMNP2 (Figure 10b ) [53] . Again, two sets of doublets in the W4f spectrum for AMNP2 (Figure 10b ) were measured at 32/33.2 eV and 32/34.2 eV, which suggest different phases of the W compounds (i.e., W and WC) are present in AMNP2.",

In summary, the overall atomic ratios were found and the average values were calculated using the data obtained from 30, 60, 120, 200, and 240 s intervals, as the sample surfaces at these intervals were stabilised under the conditions applied.

As can be seen from both the FTIR/Raman spectra and the XRD analyses, no observable contaminant was detected in AMNP0 when compared with micro-metre sized commercial WC. This suggested that the production method (Tesima TM thermal plasma technology) used to manufacture these formulations have reliable quality control. To further support the chemical content found in AMNP0, XPS analyses have recorded C1s and W4f binding energies emitted by the carbidic bonding presence in AMNP0. XPS analysis also measured the atomic ratio of the C1s:W4f content as 42.7:47.3%. It is also worth noting that a carbidic type of carbon signal (\u03b4 C 254/307 ppm) associated with WC was detected using solid state NMR and it is the first report that has been published regarding this finding.",

The high metallic ratio in AMNP2 was found to be five times more than that found in AMNP1 (17% vs. 3%) and can impart potential antimicrobial functions. The majority of the high carbon content found in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 (confirmed by Raman, NMR, and XPS analyses) may have been designed to increase bio-compatibilities and to reduce cytotoxicity effects.",

In this aspect, identifications of any active sites and intermetallic properties present in the particles will provide insights for AMNP modifications and so to develop customised antimicrobial agents for selective pathogens.
