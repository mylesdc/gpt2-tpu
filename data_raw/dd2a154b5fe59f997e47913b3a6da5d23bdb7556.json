Resveratrol (RSV) has been used as a preclinical drug for the treatment of the metabolic disorders. However, the impact of RSV on HBV replication remains unknown. In this study, the HBV-expressing hepatocelluar carcinoma cell line and mouse model created by hydrodynamic injection of viral DNA were used. We found that RSV activates Sirt1, which in turn deacetylates PGC-1\u03b1 and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b1, leading to the enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that this pathway is also required for fastinginduced HBV transcription. Taken together, this study identifies that RSV enhances HBV transcription and replication especially acting on the core promoter, which depends on Sirt1-PGC-1\u03b1-PPAR\u03b1 pathway. We conclude that RSV may exacerbate the progression of hepatitis B and that patients with hepatitis B infection should be cautious taking RSV as a dietary supplement.",

RSV was also found to be effective in treating influenza virus 18 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 19 . RSV has also been shown to synergize with several antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 20 and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 21 . In an in vivo study, 25% RSV cream can achieve the same efficacy in the treatment of HSV-1-induced skin lesions on the abraded epidermis of SKH1 mice as 5% acyclovir cream 22 .

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cell viability for RSV treatment was 106.3 \u03bcM and then the 50 \u03bcM was an effective concentration chosen for the following experiments of RSV (Fig. 1a) . To explore the impact of RSV on HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells, equivalent numbers of cells were exposed to 50 \u03bcM RSV or control vehicle for 72 hours and HBV DNA in the culture medium was measured by real-time qPCR. We found that RSV treatment dose-dependently upregulated HBV DNA levels by nearly 8 times higher than the control (Fig. 1b) . Same results were obtained in HepG2 (data not show) and Huh7 cells transiently transfected with 1.3mer HBV genomic DNA (Fig. 1c) . We then established an HBV replication mouse model with hydrodynamic injection of 1.3mer HBV genomic DNA (10 \u03bcg/per mouse) according to a previous study 24 . After injection, the serum HBV DNA number in mice remained at a low level of [10 3 ] IU/ml for more than one month (Fig. 1d) , which is consistent with the previous data 25 . After treatment of RSV (100 mg/kg/d) via daily oral gavage of RSV for 2 weeks, the serum HBV DNA levels were significantly increased and maintained at a higher level towards the end point of the drug administration (Fig. 1e) , suggesting that RSV is a strong stimulator for HBV DNA replication.",

            "text": "RSV activates the HBV core promoter. To further investigate the mechanism by which RSV upregulates HBV replication, we measured the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and preC RNA in HepG2.2.15 cells by real-time qPCR, HBcAg expression by Western blot, and the HBsAg and HBeAg contents released into the culture medium by ELISA. We found that RSV treatment increased not only pgRNA and preC RNA levels by almost 6-fold and 4-fold respectively, but also HBeAg and HBcAg levels by nearly 5-fold and 3-fold respectively, with a slight increase in HBsAg expression (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that the transcription of HBV DNA was activated by the RSV treatment, especially at the region of viral core promoter. Our in vivo experiments further supported these observations. RSV treatment (100 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks increased HBsAg and HBeAg levels in circulation (Fig. 2b,c) , indicating that the viral core promoter plays a key role in the process. We then measured the activities of the preS1, preS2 and core promoters respectively in HepG2 cells. We found that while RSV treatment increased the core promoter activity by nearly 16-fold, it activated preS1 and preS2 promoters with much less potency (Fig. 2d) . To further confirm the results in vivo, 6 \u03bcg of 1.3\u00d7 HBV-Cp-Luc plasmid DNA was hydromatically injected into the mice. 72 hours later, the mice were treated with RSV for 20 minutes. The activity of the core promoter in mice liver was measured by the animal imaging system in real time. We found that RSV increased the luciferase signals in the liver by nearly 1.3-fold, compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 2e) . These results suggest that RSV promotes HBV replication by activating the HBV core promoter. In vivo luciferase analysis of mice was observed after administration of water (control group, NC) or RSV (experimental group, Exp). Representative images for visualization of luciferase activity (left) and their quantitative analysis data (right) were shown. The gels have been run under the same experimental conditions. *p < 0.05 with n = 6 /group. 26 . To identify the transcription factor(s) involved in the activation of the core promoter by RSV, we knocked down various HBV-related transcriptional factors including Jun Proto-Oncogene (c-Jun), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alpha/retinoid x receptor, alpha (PPAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1), CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha (C/EBP\u03b1), farnesoid x -activated receptor (FXR\u03b1), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha (HNF4\u03b1) in HepG2.215 cells by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Real-time qPCR data demonstrated that knockdown of PPAR\u03b1 or RXR\u03b1 abolished RSV-induced HBV replication ( Fig. 3a) , while knockdown of the others didn't affect supernatant HBV DNA levels (Fig. 3b ). To examine whether PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 could regulate the HBV core promoter, we knocked down PPAR\u03b1 or RXR\u03b1 by siRNA in HepG2 cells following pGL3-Cp transfection and RSV treatment. Evidently, knockdown of either PPAR or RXR reduced the luciferase signal of the core promoter (Fig. 3c) . To further evaluate the activity of PPAR\u03b1 / RXR\u03b1 affected by RSV treatment, we measured the expression of PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 target genes by RT-qPCR in HepG2.2.15 cells and the mouse liver. RSV stimulated the expression of PPAR\u03b1 target genes promoting fatty acid oxidation (FAO), such as key mitochondrial medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), microsome cytochrome P450 in FAO and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (mHMG-CoAs) in ketogenesis (Fig. 3d) . Taken together, the activation of PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 on core promoter plays a key role in RSV-induced HBV transcription.",

To analyze whether PGC-1\u03b1 is a signal that links Sirt1 to PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 in RSV-induced HBV replication, we examined the PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation in HepG2.2.15 cells. RSV treatment significantly decreased the acetylation level of PGC-1\u03b1 protein in HepG2.2.15 cells (Fig. 5a ) and increased the interaction between endogenous Sirt1 and PGC-1\u03b1 (Fig. 5b) . Pretreatment of nicotinamide (NAM), a Sirt1 activity inhibitor, restored the acetylated PGC-1\u03b1 level to that of the untreated group (Fig. 5a) . To determine whether PGC-1\u03b1 is required for RSV-induced HBV replication, we knocked down PGC-1\u03b1 by siRNA in HepG2.2.15 cells. PGC-1\u03b1 deficiency caused a significant decrease of HBV DNA in the culture medium compared to the control (Fig. 5c) . Similarly, knockdown of PGC-1\u03b1 significantly reduced RSV-stimulated core promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5d ). In sum, these findings indicate that Sirt1 activated by RSV directly regulates PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation, resulting in RSV-induced HBV replication.",

Given that the fact that PPAR\u03b1 's transcriptional activity can be activated by fasting 38, 39 and the essential role of PGC-1\u03b1 /PPAR\u03b1 axis in mediating RSV-induced HBV replication, we reckoned that PPAR\u03b1 may be required for fasting-triggered HBV replication.

The core promoter activity, assessed by the luciferase intensity, was time-dependently increased in all fasted mice (Fig. 6a,e) . To verify the role of (g) Sirt1 antagonist NAM markedly blocked RSV-stimulated activity of the viral core promoter. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with pGL3-Cp and pRL-TK plasmids for 24 hours and cells were then treated with RSV (50 \u03bcM) or RSV (50 \u03bcM) plus NAM (10 mM) for 72 h.

Although RSV was found to have effects on several viral infections, this study is the first time to demonstrate that RSV actually induces HBV replication in vitro and in vivo. Given the fact that there are increasing successful cases of preclinical trials of RSV treatment on a variety of human diseases 43, 44 , our data raises a serious concern about the risk of possible side effects of RSV, such as treatment of RSV in patients with metabolic disorders simultaneously infected with HBV. In addition, RSV exists in a number of fruits such as red grapes (50-100 mg/g) 45 and drinks such as red wine (0.2 mg/l to 5.8 mg/l) 46 at a notable concentrations. Patients with HBV infection, especially HBV carriers and occult infection patients, would have a risk of HBV recurrence when drinking over-dosed red wine. Given the drinking culture in large populations worldwide, additional studies would be required to determine the guideline amount for red wine drinking in HBV patients.",

The discrepancy between the two studies discussed above may be partially due to different cell models and experimental conditions used. In our study, unlike Act3, RSV alone displays a strong ability to promote HBV replication in a Sirt1-PGC-1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 -dependent manner. Sirt1, PGC-1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b1 / RXR\u03b1 proteins appear to constitute a sub-network that modulates the HBV core promoter activity and viral transcription. RSV-induced Sirt1 activation mediates HBV transcription, and inhibition of Sirt1 by NAM attenuates this effect, suggesting that activation of Sirt1 is required for RSV-induced HBV replication. Given the limited effects of Sirt1 overexpression or activation by Act3 on the HBV transcription, the most likely explanation is that RSV has both Sirt1-dependent and independent functions 50 , which can simultaneously activate other signals to augment the function of this sub-network, such as activation of PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1 through other pathways.",

Dramatic changes in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation are prominent features of the energy-metabolic responses. Shlomai A et al. demonstrated that PGC-1\u03b1 controls HBV replication through nutritional signals and interestingly, PGC-1\u03b1 co-activates HNF4\u03b1 , a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, to promote HBV replication 37 . However, we think that the role of HNF4\u03b1 is not conclusive due to lack of loss of function study to demonstrate the necessity of HNF4\u03b1 in this process. In our study, although the expression of gluconeugenic genes was upregulated after 7-hour fasting, there was no similar change in the gene expression in the time points of prolonged fasting (Fig. 6c) , suggesting that the activation of gluconeogenesis is not associated with fasting-induced HBV viral replication. Instead, we found that genes involved in FAO were closely associated with fasting-induced HBV transcription and replication. This was further confirmed by our experiments where inhibition of PPAR\u03b1 , a key enzyme of FAO, alleviated fasting-induced HBV transcription in vivo, providing strong evidence that FAO plays an important role in HBV replication in the hosts exposed to nutrient/energy deficiency.",
