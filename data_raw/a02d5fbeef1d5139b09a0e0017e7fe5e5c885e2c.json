Deep sequencing and functional screening of viral metagenomic DNA from a near-boiling thermal pool identified clones expressing thermostable DNA polymerase (Pol) activity. Among these, 3173 Pol demonstrated both high thermostability and innate reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. We describe the biochemistry of 3173 Pol and report its use in single-enzyme reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Wild-type 3173 Pol contains a proofreading 39-59 exonuclease domain that confers high fidelity in PCR. An easier-to-use exonuclease-deficient derivative was incorporated into a PyroScript RT-PCR master mix and compared to oneenzyme (Tth) and two-enzyme (MMLV RT/Taq) RT-PCR systems for quantitative detection of MS2 RNA, influenza A RNA, and mRNA targets. Specificity and sensitivity of 3173 Pol-based RT-PCR were higher than Tth Pol and comparable to three common two-enzyme systems. The performance and simplified set-up make this enzyme a potential alternative for research and molecular diagnostics.",

Most RT-PCR protocols rely on two DNA polymerase (Pol) enzymes; a retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) to copy RNA into cDNA and a thermostable DNA Pol to amplify the target sequence. We describe a unique single-enzyme alternative to the traditional format based on the innate reverse transcriptase activity of the thermostable 3173 Pol, which was recently isolated from a viral metagenomic library [1, 2] . We believe this is the first report of a reagent enzyme produced from a viral metagenomic library, the first viral Pol shown to be fully thermostable in vitro and the first single-enzyme RT-PCR protocol with high sensitivity and specificity comparable to two-enzyme systems.",

Cells were pelleted at 2,800 rcf and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication and host proteins were denatured by incubation at 70uC for 10 minutes. Soluble proteins were collected from the supernatant after centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 10 minutes and assayed for DNA Pol activity based on their ability to extend a 59 fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primer. The labeled assay primer was annealed at room temperature to the assay template and incubated for 10 minutes at 70uC with 5 ml of each clarified lysate. Primer extension was detected using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in GeneScan mode. For preparative expression, the coding sequence of 3173 Pol was inserted into pET28 and used to transform BL21(DE3) cells according to the manufacturer (EMD Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Pol proteins were expressed, extracted and heattreated as described for the functional screen and purified using heparin-agarose and Q-sepharose chromatography.",

Influenza A RNA was isolated from cultures of MCDK cells infected with Influenza A strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). Infected cells were clarified by centrifugation and RNA isolated by QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit was frozen immediately. No DNase treatment was used for either preparation. For detection of transcripts, total human liver RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used. For quantification, MS2 RNA was re-suspended in 100 mM EDTA and the RNA concentration was estimated by absorbance at 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 40 mg ml21 OD21. The estimated MS2 RNA copy number was calculated from the determined concentration using an average molecular weight for an RNA base of 340 g mole21 and the MS2 genome length of 3,569 nt.

Both radioactive and fluorogenic incorporation assays indicated strong RNA-dependent DNA synthesis (reverse transcription) activity for 3173 Pol in buffers containing either magnesium or manganese (not shown). We used two assays (Figure 3 ) to compare the RT activities of the wild-type and exonuclease deficient 3173 Pols to those of AMV and MMLV RTs at 37uC or 65uC on an oligo dT primed poly A substrate. The AMV and MMLV had higher RT activity at 37uC while the 3173 Pol RT was much more active at 65uC using the fluorogenic incorporation assay ( Figure 3A ). The Taq polymerase and no enzyme controls had no detectable RT activity at either temperature. Extension products from a 59fluorophore-labeled dT20 primer were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel to further demonstrate RT activity and to assess the relative lengths of the extension products of the 3173 Pol and MMLV RT ( Figure 3B ). Both RTs were able to efficiently extend the primer when polyA RNA template was provided. The length distribution of the 3173 Pol cDNAs was visibly shorter than that produced by the MMLV RT, although a subset of the 3173 extension products appeared to be so large that they barely entered the gel. Incubation of the DNA primer:RNA template complex with the Taq Pol negative control resulted in a structure-dependent 59-39 exonuclease cleavage product that migrated at the dye front [39] . As an additional test to compare the RT activity of the 3173 Pol to that of MMLV-RT on a complex RNA substrate, a primer specific to bases 714 to 690 of the negative sense RNA MS2 genome [40] was 59-fluorophore-labeled. The labeled cDNA primer was extended using extracted MS2 RNA as a template ( Figure 3C ). The 3173 Pol and MMLV RT were both able to extend the primer to produce faint, nearly full-length products although the 3173 Pol product was detectably longer than that of MMLV RT. The 3173 Pol also synthesized a larger amount of several shorter length extension products from 175 to 300 bases in length. The MMLV RT formed a visible template-independent product in the absence of added RNA template that was not resolved by the gel, while the 3173 Pol did not.",

Of the two longer target sequences tested, only the 821 bp beta-actin sequence (Lane C3) was reverse transcribed by the 3173 Pol and this synthesis appeared less efficient than that of MMLV RT. Interestingly, both enzymes appeared to reverse transcribe with primers that would not be expected to prime near the target. (A1, A11, B14) and even in the absence of primers (Lane A7, B17, C17). In the case of 3173 Pol, it is likely that both cDNA synthesis and amplification occur during the PCR step so the presence or absence of primers during cDNA synthesis may be inconsequential.

Replication of native retroviral genomes depends on specific sequences within the terminal repeats [43] , which may be related to a significant bias seen with certain combinations of primer Table 1 and 3173 Pol. A. Products from 89 to 362 bp in length were amplified using one-step singleenzyme RT-PCR cycling conditions: 15 sec @ 94uC, (10 s @ 94uC, 30 s @ 72uC)*40. Products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. B. The MS2 RNA was diluted from 10 1 to 10 7 -fold and amplified using a primer pair corresponding to the 160 bp fragment in Panel A. Real-time PCR fluorescence in RFU (relative fluorescence units) vs. PCR cycles. C. Post-amplification thermal melt in -dRFU/dTemperature vs. Temperature (uC). Light blue region indicates melt curves for specific products. D. Standard curve PCR Cycle threshold vs. log 10 RNA copy number in triplicate with linear least squares best fit line. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0038371.g006 sequences and reverse transcriptases [44] used in vitro. In particular, the two 39-terminal nucleotides of the primers can account for a 35,000-fold range in the frequency of misincorporation, a measured Km variation of 100-fold and Vmax range of several-fold when used with MMLV or AMV RTs [5] . These preferences are possible causes of amplification errors, amplification bias [8] , poor concordance between tests [9, 45] and sequences that are completely refractory to reverse transcription [44, 45] .",

Additional mutations incorporated into SuperScript III RT (Life Technologies) to increase thermostability may have resulted in lower sensitivity [10] and exacerbated the interference with Taq Pol [16] , but still have not provided adequate thermostability for single-enzyme RT-PCR.

The physiological role of the RT activity of 3173 Pol is not clear. Lacking a cultivated virus/host combination, the replication mechanism of the source virus can only be inferred from sequence data. Based on the method of library construction, the virion has a double-stranded DNA genome. Thus, the overall viral replication mechanism is distinct from retroviruses.",

A previously reported half-life of Taq Pol at 95uC is 20 minutes [50] . Although the thermostability of 3173 Pol is significantly lower than Taq and most other commonly used thermostable Pols, it is clearly adequate for PCR since product continues to accumulate up to forty cycles (Figures 6  and 7) . The combination of thermostability and reverse transcriptase activity in one enzyme has practical implications. Because the two enzyme RT systems contain a thermolabile protein component, the use of hot start technologies to improve specificity of reverse transcription is not practical. The 3173 Pol should allow ''hot start'' methods to function during reverse transcription as well as amplification, which should improve specificity (data not shown).",

The higher reverse transcription temperature, combined with the strand displacement activity, should improve specificity and allow synthesis through difficult, structured and G/ C rich RNA templates and may have been the basis of the lower amount of spurious products in PyroScript reactions seen in Figure 8 .

The nucleotide dissociation constants for Pol I enzymes from T. thermophilus and three thermostable Bacillus species were reportedly between 115 and 85 mM [54] . Processivity is probably related to affinity for template. The phi29 Pol has a processivity value of greater than 70,000 nt [27] . The processivity of 3173 (47 nt) is comparatively modest but still higher than either Bst or Taq Pols (37 and 9 nt, respectively). While processivity measurements are highly dependent on reaction conditions, the measured result for Taq is comparable with previously published values [50] .",

            "text": "Although it is not as important for detection and quantification applications, fidelity is critical for preparative cDNA synthesis methods and for transcriptome sequencing. Published methods of fidelity measurement use DNA templates [35] . Using a variant of these methods, the wild-type 3173 Pol had a fidelity of 6.7610 4 similar to our measurements for the most accurate PCR enzymes, Pfu and Phusion Pols (5.8610 4 and 7.5610 4 respectively) when assayed in parallel. An exonuclease deficient mutant of 3173 Pol had a PCR fidelity of 0.9610 4 , similar to the value measured for Taq Pol (1.4610 4 ) and slightly below the reported range of 2.5 to 5.0610 4 for Taq Pol [32, 35] . Published in vitro fidelity measurements for MMLV RT are especially difficult to compare since the assay conditions and temperatures are quite different; however, the reported fidelity for MMLV RT is between 1.7 and 3.0610 4 [55] . Measurement of the fidelity of 3173 Pol on RNA templates will require extensive studies beyond the scope of this report. If the fidelity on RNA is similar to the fidelity on DNA, 3173 Pol could prove especially valuable as an RNA sequencing enzyme for transcriptomics research. Thus, the determination of 3173 Pol fidelity is the basis of ongoing study. The PyroScript mix was comparable in sensitivity to three leading commercial two-step RT-PCR kits when used to detect either MS2 phage or influenza A RNA. Background amplification in the absence of target, especially after 40 cycles of PCR, is problematic in clinical diagnostic tests where RNA target copies may approach single molecule levels. This problem is exacerbated in two-enzyme, one-step RT-PCR since the retroviral RTs are not thermostable and background reduction during reverse transcription using hot start methods for these RTs are not possible. We found that both the MS2 and the influenza one-step RT-PCR amplification reactions exhibited some propensity for non-specific product formation. However, all of the one-step kits produced background at similar or higher levels. Furthermore, these background products were often generated in earlier cycles than the 3173 enzyme false products. The yield of end product formed by the Transcriptor and by the Superscript reagents appeared greater than those of the Quanta and the PyroScript mixes ( Figure 5 ), likely due to higher recommended amounts of primers used by these reactions (500 nM vs. 200 nM). However, the higher concentration of primers probably resulted in increased background observed with the Transcriptor and SuperScript reagents. With additional effort, reaction parameters for any of the enzymes could undoubtedly be optimized for specificity or for yield. This higher yield of end product does not appear to affect qPCR results.",

            "text": "While the PyroScript enzyme mix shows utility for a range of detection applications, we noted some limitations. The use of 3173 Pol for amplification of targets greater than about 350 nt is not reproducible although both the 3173 wild-type and exo-mutants generate PCR products from DNA targets up to 5 kb and higher (data not shown). This is consistent with the shorter length of cDNA products that we observed in the labeled primer extension experiments ( Figure 3B) . Figure 3C indicates a small amount of full-length, 714 nt cDNA product, although the bulk of product is less than 300 nt. Each of these shorter products terminates within a region of secondary structure of the MS2 RNA associated with RNase sensitivity [56] so these apparent size limits may reflect labile sites in target RNA and may have to do with RNA stability at the high extension temperatures used with 3173 Pol (72uC) than with inherent properties of the enzyme. Most detection modes amplify much shorter targets, but preparative RT-PCR with 3173 Pol will likely be affected by this observed limitation. In contrast to the two-enzyme mixes, use of 3173 Pol in RT-PCR was significantly more reliable when the primers were designed to anneal at the higher (72uC) annealing/extension temperature of the two step PCR protocol. Throughout the RT-qPCR studies, we used dye binding as the detection mode. An alternative detection chemistry uses hydrolysis probes commonly known as TaqManH probes (Life Technologies) [57] . This chemistry was not tested since the 3173 Pol lacks the 59-39 exonuclease activity required to cleave a TaqMan probe. Finally, while the 3173 Pol reliably detected high abundance transcripts, as shown in Figure 6 , it was noticeably less consistent with less abundant targets. The reason for this inconsistency is not fully understood and is under investigation. One explanation may be that the enzyme is sensitive to high abundances of non-target sequences, typical in total RNA extracts. This effect has been seen to a lesser extent with MMLV RT-based RT-PCR [10] and with optimization may be ameliorated. Such abundant non-target RNA is generally absent in viral RNA preparations and the 3173 Pol has proven especially useful for detection and quantification of RNA viruses. For detection of RNA viruses the PyroScript mix appears to be competitive with two enzymes systems that use a retroviral RT and a thermostable Taq Pol. Since RNA viruses including influenza, HIV, Dengue, West Nile and SARS coronavirus represent a substantial portion of emerging pathogens worldwide, an improved means of detecting and quantifying these viruses could have an important impact on global health care.",

Primer extension has traditionally been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis of fluorescently tagged primer extension products allows quantitative determination of processivity by direct measurement of the number of nucleotides incorporated and the amount of each extension product based on electrophoretic mobility and peak integration. Reactions where the observed lengths of extension no longer increased with time were chosen for analysis. This approach showed a mean processivity of 47 nucleotides for 3173 Pol. The same analysis indicated processivity of 9 and 37 nucleotides for Taq and Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) Pol I enzymes, respectively. The 3173 enzyme has a half-life at 94uC of about eleven minutes. In contrast Taq Pol measured under the same conditions lost 45% activity over the two hour assay. The thermal profile of 3173 Pol (",
