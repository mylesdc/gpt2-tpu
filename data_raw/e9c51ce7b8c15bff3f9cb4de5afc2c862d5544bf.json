Currently, there are no effective drugs approved for the treatment of JEV infection. Drug-repurposing screening is an alternative approach to discover potential antiviral agents. In this study, high-content screening (HCS) of a natural extracts library was performed, and two hit FDA-approved Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 -ATPase inhibitors, ouabain and digoxin, were identified as having robust efficiency against JEV infection with the selectivity indexes over 1,000. The results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the JEV infection at the replication stage by targeting the Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 -ATPase. Furthermore, it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by JEV in a BALB/c mouse model. This work demonstrated that Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 -ATPase could serve as the target of treatment of JEV infection, and ouabain has the potential to be developed as an effective anti-JEV drug.",

To reveal novel targets and inhibitors against JEV infection, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)-based HCS assay was performed by screening a library of 1,034 natural extracts for the anti-JEV activities ( Fig. 1A ; Table S1 ). As shown in Fig. 1B and C, 851 compounds were selected for the second screening because of their solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature and absence of any obvious cytotoxicity on Vero cells. Compounds (50 M) that exerted a \u03fe90% inhibition against JEV were defined as prime candidates; based on this criterion, 23 compounds (2.22%) were selected. A screening to reconfirm the results was then carried out using these prime candidates over a broader concentration range (3. 125 to 50 M). Eight hit compounds (0.77%) were selected based on their concentration-dependent inhibitory effects and a cell viability of \u03fe80% ( Fig. 2A and B) . Among the 8 compounds, ouabain and digoxin were subjected to further investigation because of their high selective indexes (SI, which is defined as 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ]/50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]) and similar mechanisms (namely, they are cardiac glycoside compounds and act as inhibitors of Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 -ATPase) of \u03fe1,917 and \u03fe969.9, respectively.

As ouabain exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity on JEV infections, we further examined the protective effect of ouabain on JEV-induced lethality by using the BALB/c mouse.

The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, ouabain treatment significantly reduced viral load in infected mice compared to untreated infected mice. Notably, no plaques formed in the ouabain-treated group on day 21 postinfection (Fig. 6B) . Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, and vacuolar degeneration, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 7 postinfection, while ouabain treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 6C) . These results indicate that alleviation of histopathological changes is accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in mortality rate, further confirming the curative effects of ouabain on viral encephalitis. The viral loads of brain, blood, and spleen were also evaluated at the early stage of infection. As shown in Fig. 6D , on day 1 postinfection, viral titers in the brain were almost undetectable, and ouabain exhibited little effect on viral titers in the brain at the preclinical stage. Accordingly, ouabain had little effect on decreasing viral titers in the blood and spleen at the earlier time points, which was mostly due to that the detectable viral genome copy numbers were too low to be comparable. Notably, titers in the blood decreased sharply from day 1 to day 3 postinfection, which was in line with the characteristic viremia caused by JEV. These results indicate that ouabain could alleviate histopathological changes and reduce viral loads in the brain, thus protecting mice against JEV-induced lethality and confirming the curative effects of ouabain on viral encephalitis. FGIN-1-27, an anxiolytic drug that targets the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, reduced the JEV infection in vitro (15) . Drug screening and repurposing has become a very useful approach for identifying antiviral drugs, as it explores novel molecular targets to study virus pathogenesis.",

Recently, ouabain and digoxin have been proven to inhibit different kinds of viruses, including enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses, nonenveloped viruses such as reoviruses, DNA viruses such as human cytomegalovirus, positive-sense RNA viruses such as chikungunya virus, and negative-sense RNA viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Notably, we have tried to select drug-resistant variants by serial passaging of JEV using increasing concentrations of digoxin and ouabain, respectively. However, no adaptive mutant was found after 25 passages with either drug. This result suggested that both drugs might exert the antiviral effects by targeting the cellular protein other than the viral protein, making the barrier to resistance more difficult to overcome.",

In this study, ouabain exhibited therapeutic effects on JEV infection in an adult mouse model by decreasing viral loads and alleviating pathological injuries in the brain, which significantly improved the survival rate of JEV-infected mice. We proposed two mechanisms that may contribute to the antiviral effects. First, ouabain may block JEV infection by inducing the cellular stress response. Ouabain treatment in mammalian cells causes the interaction between the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor and Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 -ATPase to induce calcium oscillations and further activate calcium-dependent transcription factors, such as the NF-B and activator protein (27) . Some evidence suggested that cardiac glycosides mediate inflammatory processes via the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (28, 29) . These signaling pathways also cause the activation of NF-B. Many of the genes expressed were elicited by activation of NF-B, including innate immune response, growth, and differentiation, which stimulate an antiviral state that might block JEV infection in the end (30) . Second, JEV could replicate in the central nervous system (CNS), and infections result in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) along with an influx of inflammatory cells; the breakdown of BBB caused by JEV infection may have allowed BBB-nonpermissive ouabain to enter the brain, bind the murine ATPase \u24232 and \u24233 isoforms (31) , and inhibit viral replication in neurons.",

Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment for JEV infection. Recently, Wang et al. performed a library screen of 1,018 FDA-approved compounds and reported that manidipine, a calcium blocker using in the treatment of hypertension, inhibited JEV infection in vitro and in vivo (11). Similarly, Fang et al. tested 1,280 FDA-approved drugs and found that",

(A) Survival of mice in each group was monitored for 21 days after inoculation of JEV by intraperitoneal injection. Data are shown as Kaplan-Meier survival curves (n \u03ed 14 to 15 for each group). (B) The viral loads in mouse brains were measured by plaque assay on days 7, 10, and 21. (C) Ouabain treatment alleviated the histopathological changes in mice caused by JEV infection. Arrows indicate the histopathological changes such as meningitis, perivascular cuffing, and glial nodules. (D) The viral loads in brain, blood, and spleen were measured by qRT-PCR on days 1 and 3, respectively. Dashed lines indicate limit of detection.
