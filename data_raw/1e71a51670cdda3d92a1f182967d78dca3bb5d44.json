We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8 + T cells (which express \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed \u03b27 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA. Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.",

Therefore, in our study, we used RA combined with whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) to immunize piglets via subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination 22 in order to induce T cell homing to the small bowel intestinal mucosa, as well as to generate more mucosal DCs.

The mucosal immune mechanism includes naive lymphocyte activation in classical inductive sites (such as intestinal Peyer's patches), after which the sensitized lymphocytes migrate to the blood circulation before homing to effector sites (such as the intestinal epithelium or lamina propria) and differentiating into effector lymphocytes that contribute to immunity 6 . Effective viral clearance requires the rapid migration of effector T cells to the site of intestinal infection. Intestinal lymphocyte homing includes lymphocytes selectively passing through the postcapillary venule and migrating directly to the intestinal epithelium or lamina propria. T cells migrating to the intestine require the expression of specific receptors, including homing receptors, such as \u03b1 4\u03b2 7-integrin and CCR9, and their corresponding ligands (i.e., addressin-cell adhesion molecule 1, MAdCAM1) on endothelial cells from intestinal postcapillary venules 7 as well as ligands (such as CCL25) on the intestinal epithelium 8, 9 . CCR9/CCL25 interactions can induce the homing of effector T and B cells to the gut 10, 11 . Additionally, these interactions can guide plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) to the intestine 12, 13 .",

For TGEV-specific IgA antibody detection, 0.3 g faecal sample was resuspended with 1 ml of PBS, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0C for TGEV-specific IgA antibody detection. On days 35 after first vaccination, pigs were exsanguinated, the ileum and the right side of the inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) were stored in PBS. And then cells from the ileum and ILNs were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry 25 . A portion of the ileum was triturated with a mortar and liquid nitrogen, and the homogenate was weighed and dissolved in PBS at a dilution of 1 mg per 5 \u03bcl. The supernatants of these homogenates were collected after centrifugation for the detection of specific IgA antibodies. After dilution, the homogenate supernatant protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce).

We subcutaneously immunized piglets with corn oil, RA, or WI-TGEV alone or in combination with RA, or we orally immunized piglets with WI-TGEV alone. To analyze whether RA has the capability of generating gut-homing cells; therefore, cells were isolated from the right side of the inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) and ileum after immunization. Intriguingly, the flow cytometry data from the ILNs showed that the number of CD8 + cells that expressed \u03b2 7-integrin and CCR9 was significantly increased after RA administration compared with the control (Fig. 1A ,B, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8 + cells expressing \u03b2 7-integrin and CCR9 compared with the s.c. administration of TGEV alone in the ILNs (Fig. 1A ,B, P < 0.05). Lymphocyte homing to the small intestine is believed to play a crucial role at mucosal immunity effector sites, and CD8 + effector T cells in intestinal epithelium can effectively prevent or directly limit infection at the entrance site of enteric viruses 33 . Furthermore, effector T cells maintain the epithelial barrier and tissue homeostasis 34 . In our study, the ileum was selected as the mucosal immune effector site. Additionally, we assessed the level of CD8 + cell homing to the ileum. Notably, the flow cytometry data from the ileum showed that following the RA plus TGEV s.c. and oral TGEV treatments, the gut tropism receptor frequency on CD8 + cells was remarkably enhanced compared with the controls (Fig. 1C ,D, P < 0.05). Next, we further evaluated the number of CD3 + cells in the porcine ileum with immunohistochemistry. In the cross-sectional view, CD3 + T cells were gathered in the epithelial layer and villous lamina propria (Fig. 1E, 400\u00d7 magnification) . The RA plus TGEV s.c. administration substantially expanded the areas with CD3 + T cells compared with the controls (Fig. 1F , P < 0.01), although these levels were lower than those observed with the oral TGEV treatment.",

In the ileum, the areas of IgA-secreting cells of the RA plus TGEV s.c. and oral TGEV treatment were significantly increased than control (P < 0.01), and the RA plus TGEV s.c. treatment significantly increased the areas containing IgA-secreting cells compared with the TGEV s.c. alone treatment (Fig. 2G, P < 0.01) , however, this level was slightly less than the level observed following the oral TGEV delivery. Furthermore, we noted that the IgA-secreting cells displayed IgA and CCR9 co-expression in the villous lamina propria after the RA plus TGEV challenge (Fig. 2H-J) . A similar finding was observed in the faeces, in which the subcutaneous RA plus TGEV immunization obviously increased the TGEV-specific IgA levels compared with the s.c. TGEV alone treatment at days 7, 14 and 21(ELISA method) (Fig. 2K, P < 0.05) , and this effect lasted longer than that of the oral TGEV immunization. For the systemic immune response, in the serum, we found that the TGEV-specific IgG titres in the RA plus TGEV s.c. treatment group remained at a high level during the entire immunity period (7-35 days) and were substantially greater than those in the other groups at day 7 (Fig. 2L, P < 0.05) .

To determine whether RA in the vaccine could recruit DCs to the small intestine, we isolated intestinal cells from piglets and determined the DC numbers in the lamina propria by flow cytometry. Very few HLA-DP + CD16 + DCs (Fig. 3A,C) or SWC3a + CD11b + DCs (Fig. 3B,D) migrated to the small intestinal lamina propria following TGEV s.c. treatment. Nevertheless, the s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV and oral TGEV (positive control) significantly enhanced the frequency of these migrated DCs compared with TGEV s.c. treatment (Fig. 3C,D, P < 0.05) . These findings suggested that s.c.

Two types of TGE vaccine are currently licensed for commercial use, including live attenuated vaccines, which are delivered orally, and inactivated vaccines, which are administered via parenteral inoculation to induce immunity 3 . Although live attenuated vaccines induce efficient protective immunity, live viruses are unsafe and can revert to virulence. In the development of a vaccine, safety and effectiveness are important considerations. In recent years, inactivated vaccines have been known for their safety and have been given higher priority in the pig industry, but inactivated vaccines require multiple booster immunizations and/or supplementation with adjuvants, because they are less immunogenic than live vaccines. The initial TGEV infection occurs in the digestive tract. The oral route of vaccine delivery should be an effective method to prevent viral adhesion and colonization, thus decreasing viral shedding in the digestive tract 28 . However, the oral route for vaccine delivery is the most challenging and difficult to achieve, particularly for inactivated vaccines. The efficacies of oral inactivated vaccines are currently poor, mainly because inactivated antigens must overcome a series of mucosal barriers, including mucus, digestive fluid, and compact epithelium, before they are captured by submucosal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) 27 . Thus, oral administration generally requires a large concentration of antigens to achieve effective immune protection levels 36 . In this study, the antigen dose for the oral immunization (positive control) was 10 times greater than that of the subcutaneous immunization, which significantly increased the production cost of the vaccines. An ideal TGEV vaccine should induce both local mucosal and systemic immune responses.",

CD8\u03b1 \u03b1 T cells of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) that likely function as regulatory T cells 38 , these CD8\u03b1 \u03b1 T cell subsets in gut maintain gastrointestinal homeostasis 39 . In agreement with the migration of gut-homing CD8 + cells, our observations showed that after RA plus TGEV s.c. treatment, many CD3 + T cells were recruited to the intestinal villi and lamina propria, and these data also showed that RA-assisted antigen s.c. can establish a stronger and faster cellular immune response to defend against foreign pathogens 40 .",

Thus, a large amount of IgA-secreting cell homing to the gut is important to produce IgA antibody against intestinal pathogens 41 . RA is required to induce gut-tropic IgA-secreting cells in mice and humans 32, 42, 43 . In our study, IgA-secreting cells were, remarkably, recruited to the intestinal lamina propria after the s.c. RA-TGEV treatment, which was in line with the subsequent strongly initiated IgA antibody response in the local porcine intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, the CCR9 expression on the IgA-secreting cells helped their cellular recruitment, and this was consistent with a previous report that RA was critical for the generation of gut-homing receptors on IgA-secreting cells 41 . Interestingly, RA plus TGEV immunization generated a long-lasting specific-sIgA response in the faeces, even though it was lower than the levels following the oral immunization, implying that an enhancement in SIgA secretion may be conducive to TGEV eliminate and infection resistance in the gut. However, it is worth mentioning that the antigen dose in the oral immunization was 10 times higher than that in the subcutaneous immunization in our study. Thus, at equal amount of antigen, it is possible that RA addition increases IgA secretion even above the secretion seen in response to the oral vaccine. Therefore, the RA administration in the subcutaneous immunization not only improved TGEV mucosal humoral immune responses but also was less expensive. Moreover, serum IgG plays a vital role in systemic immune responses, particularly for protecting against invasive pathogens that enter the bloodstream 44 . RA combined with the s.c. TGEV injection indeed induced a pronounced IgG response, which could compensate for the disadvantages of the oral immunization.",

To investigate the mechanisms by which RA acted on DCs, we directly treated porcine BM-DCs with RA (in vitro), However, the RA treatment was unable to up-regulate the gut-homing-specific molecules as in mice 8 , even with a wide range of doses. The possible reason for this may have been due to the species differences between porcine and mice. Our results also showed that RA couldn't up-regulated the expression of maturation phenotype molecules on porcine BM-DCs in vitro, such as SWC3a, CD1a, and HLA-DR molecule expression; these findings were supported by a previous study showing that RA treatment endowed BM-DCs with immature phenotypes via the down-regulation of CD80/86, CD40, and MHCII expression in mice 51 . These observations suggest that RA inhibits porcine BM-DC maturation, and they may help explain our previous observation that the DCs recruited to the intestinal lamina propria following RA-TGEV treatment were immature DCs that were conductive to capturing antigen and initiating a specific antibody response.",

            "text": "Given that RA failed to directly induce gut-homing receptors on DCs, we wondered whether RA could induce porcine lymphocytes to express the integrin \u03b2 7 and CCR9 receptors. However, in the porcine in vitro and competitive homing experiments, RA was unable to directly induce unactivated T cells to express gut-homing-specific receptors, and it also failed in inducing T-cell migration to the small bowel. We wondered about the mechanisms that induce CD8 + T cells to express the integrin \u03b2 7 and CCR9 receptors after RA-assisted TGEV s.c. challenge Scientific RepoRts | 6:24152 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24152 in vivo. Some studies have suggested that DCs are crucial in regulating downstream activation and differentiation of T cells 52, 53 . Moreover, some evidence has demonstrated that CD8 + T cells and IgA-secreting B cells express gut-homing receptors via intestinal DC interactions 10, 54 . The above analysis tempts us to speculate that RA may regulate DCs in the porcine inguinal lymph nodes to imprint gut tropism receptors on lymphocytes. Intriguingly, our data confirmed that RA cooperated with BM-DCs in promoting T cell proliferation, suggesting that RA-pretreated BM-DCs may have a powerful capacity to transfer antigens to T cells. Our data further indicated that T cells expressed high gut-homing-specific receptor levels following incubation with RA-pretreated BM-DCs, implying that porcine RA-pretreated BM-DCs may have the ability to imprint integrin \u03b2 7 and CCR9 receptor expression on lymphocytes. Moreover, a cell migration assay was performed using transwell inserts, and the T cells that were treated with RA and DCs displayed a strong chemotactic response to porcine CCL25, which was consistent with a recent study in mice 8 that showed a powerful homing capacity for these cells. Additionally, the capacity of RA-pretreated DCs to induce gut-homing receptors on responding T cells was blocked by an RAR antagonist, and those T cells lost the ability to migrate, supporting the hypothesis that RA is indispensable for generating gut tropic T cells in piglets. In view of the in vitro study, the RA-pretreated BM-DCs showed a significant ability to activate T cells to express gut-homing receptors for migration. One possible mechanism for this, with regard to the RA-pretreated DCs, is that RA could act as a \"mucosal adjuvant\" to induce mucosal DC and lymphocyte activation 18, 54 . Furthermore, exogenous RA promotes intestinal lamina propria DCs to produce endogenous RA 55 , which guarantees gut-homing \u03b1 4\u03b2 7 and CCR9 expression by effector T cells 11 . Thus, another possibility is that the RA-pretreated DCs may also generate or combine with other cytokines to jointly promote gut-homing molecule expression, such as RA inducing mucosal DCs to secrete TGF \u03b2 and IL-6, which enhance gut-homing receptors on lymphocytes 18 . However, the mechanistic knowledge by which porcine intestinal DC subsets develop is still limited; therefore, further studies will be needed to obtain insights into these potential mechanisms.",

BM-DCs were treated with or without RA, or with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 2 days and then co-cultured with CD3 + T cells for 5 days.(B,C) In MLR experiments, RA-treated BM-DCs were used in two graded cell numbers to stimulate CFSE-labelled CD3 + T cells (DC:T cell ratios, 1:1 (B) or 1:10 (C)), and T-cell proliferation was detected with flow cytometry. (D,E) The expression levels of gut-homing-specific PE-\u03b2 7-integrin + DyLight 649-CCR9 + on FITC-CD8 + T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. DC:T-cell ratios, 1:1 (D) or 1:10 (E). (F) The schematic depicts co-cultured cells (RA-treated BM-DCs and CD3 + T cells 1 \u00d7 10 6 ) that were resuspended in 0.35 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and loaded onto the apical side of transwells (Corning, Lowell, MA; pore size, 8 \u03bcm). Then, 0.9 ml of medium or medium plus CCL25 (10 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the transwells. The numbers of cells that migrated to the basolateral side were measured. (G) Co-culture of CD3 + T cells and RA-treated BM-DCs, (H) co-culture of CD3 + T cells and RA and/or RO 41-5253-treated BM-DCs. *P < 0.05. The data represent the means \u00b1 S.D. of three samples. The results shown are from a representative experiment out of three. Scientific RepoRts | 6:24152 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24152",
