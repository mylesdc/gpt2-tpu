The most important viral agent include bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) [1] . BRSV, belonging to the genus Pneumovirus within the family Paramyxoviridae, and is one of the most important causes of lower respiratory tract infections in calves [2] ; however, adult animals with subclinical infection are the main source of infection, since reinfections are common in the herds. It is highly prevalent in cattle, with a significant economic impact as the most important viral cause of BRDC worldwide [3] . BVDV is a Pestivirus from the family Flaviviridae [4] , which affects the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems in different production animals [5] . Clinical signs include pyrexia, diarrhea, reduced production, and highly morbid disease but cause low mortality of infected animals [6] . Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is an important infectious disease of domestic and wild cattle caused by BHV-1. This virus is a member of genus Varicellovirus, which belongs to the Herpesviridae family. Clinical signs infection includes symptoms of inflammatory reactions in respiratory, genital tracts, abortion, and neurological disorders [7] . Betancur et al. [8] found a statistical association between seropositive animals for BHV-1 with respect sex and age in Colombia, while Ochoa et al. [9] reported higher infection in cows older than 5 years of age. BPI-3V is in the genus Respirovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae [10] , which cause serious economic losses in small and large ruminants. Clinical disease is usually mild, with symptoms of fever, nasal discharge, and cough [11] . Betancur et al. [12] reported a statistical association between seroprevalence values for BPI-3V and age groups.",

For serum, 5 ml whole blood was collected from the coccygeal venipuncture in a sterile vacutainer tube without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The serum was separated and clarified by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until the tests were performed. The total samples were proportionally distributed according to the total number of bovine present in each herd examined. Included animals showing clinical signs and healthy animals, belonged to the dual-purpose type, with ages between 7 months and 13 years. The following two age groups were conformed: <24 months and >24 months. Epidemiological data on potential risk factors were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd at the time the blood samples were collected. According to this information, none of the cattle herds were vaccinated against BHV-1, BRSV, BVDV, and BPI-3. Other data gathered in the questionnaire were included in the analysis: Municipality, herd size (small: 50-200 and Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/July-2019/4.pdf large: 201-500 animals), clinical signs (no and yes), age group of the animal (\u226424 and 24 months old), and to sex, i.e. male and females.

These values were analyzed by the Chi-square test and according to the results obtained, there was statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV in the three municipalities: About 25.5% (164/643) in Aguachica, 54.4% (37/68) in La Gloria, and 52.2% (151/289) in Rio de Oro. According to these results, the seroprevalence for BVDV is present in different proportions in the three municipalities of the Cesar department, Colombia. Nevertheless, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that the seroprevalence is present in similar proportions in the three municipalities (Table-1 ). Regarding the herd size (small and large), all the examined herds were positive for antibodies against BHV-1, BRSV, and BPI-3V; however, for BVDV 86.2% (25/29) resulted positive. According to these results, viral pathogens circulate widely in the herds with different size of the evaluated municipalities. Table-2 shows the comparison between percent positive for the viral pathogens and the age of the animals. These values were analyzed by Chi-square test, and according to with the results obtained, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV, BRSV, and BPI-3V with respect to age groups. In contrast, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between positive percent for BHV-1 and the age of the animals. Young calves were no tested for any respiratory viral pathogens. Table-3 shows the frequency of clinical signs observed in the animals tested. The retention of placenta presented the highest frequency (75.1%), followed by abortion (56.8%), fever (56.8%), and diarrhea (55.7%). The diseased animals showed temperature ranges above 40\u00b0C and the abortions pattern was observed in any trimester of the gestation. The comparison between percent positive for the viral pathogens with the presence or absence of clinical signs is shown in Table-3 . These values were analyzed by Chi-square test and according to the results obtained, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and the most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion (p>0.05). In contrast, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between positive percent for BHV-1, BRSV, and BPI-3V with the most of clinical signs, except for vulvovaginitis and conjunctivitis in BHV-1 and BPI-3V, respectively. All herds infected with BRSV showing similar clinical signs. In the present study, other infectious pathogens were not studied; however, the sensitivity of the ELISA test is high, which allows to estimate the seroprevalence of these viral pathogens in the dual-purpose cattle breeds.",

The results obtained demonstrate that BRSV is widespread among animals and dual-purpose cattle herds in Cesar department. Probably, after the initial infection occurs in some animals, the virus is rapidly spread throughout the animals, probably by aerosols, particularly in herds without prior exposure to the virus, increasing seropositivity [17] . The several herds in Colombia are not being vaccinated against BRSV and result from this research demonstrates that this virus circulates among the animals and herds from the three municipalities. It would be important to include BRSV in vaccination programs with the aim of controlling infection in this region. Regarding the age, BRSV infection was observed in both age groups in this research. Although the analysis was not done in younger animals, as reported in the literature, the clinical disease is more frequent in calves [26] . This seroreactivity in adult animals suggests possible reinfections during the course of their life. The result obtained in this research agrees with those reported by Betancur et al. [19] , who found no statistical association between infection and age group. Nevertheless, the results obtained differ from those published by Bidokhti et al. [27] , who found statistical differences with respect to the age of the infected animals. They demonstrate that after infection with BRSV, the animals will remain seropositive for several years. The older cows were seropositive while the younger cows were seronegative, i.e., there had been no virus circulating for several years. In this study, municipality, sex, and herd size were not a significant risk factor (Table-4 ). Regarding the clinical signs, animals with respiratory problems (34.9%) and conjunctivitis (38.5%) were found (Table-3) . However, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between seroprevalence values and respiratory signs in tested animals. These results are due to BRSV, which is observed in any age group, but infections that result in severe clinical disease are typically observed in calves [26] . Nevertheless, there was no sampling in calves in this research.",

These results agree with those by Carbonero et al. [14] , who found high seroprevalence values in cattle of Yucatan, Mexico. However, the results obtained in this study differ with those published by Betancur et al. [12] , who reported lower seroprevalence values (13.5%) in cattle from Monteria, Colombia. The high seroprevalence of BPI-3V found in this research is in agreement with the ubiquitous nature of the virus and with its worldwide distribution [36] . In this research, the seroprevalence was higher in the age group of >24 months of age (Table-4 ). This age group was a significant risk factor for BPI-3V transmission (OR=3.5). Possibly, due to the presence of some stress factor in these animals that favors reinfections with or without respiratory signs. In adults, especially BPI-3V, it is subclinical unless it is part of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma spp., and immunosuppressive factors [37] . With regard to the clinical signs, conjunctivitis had a statistical association with the BPI-3V seroprevalence values, and regarding sex, female was a significant risk factor for BPI-3V infection (OR=3.6).

These results agree with those by Betancur et al. [8] who reported high values of seroprevalence for BHV-1 in herds of Monteria municipality, Colombia. However, these results differ with those by Ochoa et al. and [9] Guarino et al. [38] , who reported 35.6% and 37% seroprevalence in cattle of Boyaca department, Colombia and Uruguay, respectively. With regard to the clinical signs, vulvovaginitis had a statistical association with the BHV-1 seroprevalence values, and sex and age were significant risk factors for the viral infection. The age wise seroprevalence to BHV-1 infection denoted that there was an increase in the occurrence of the infection as age advances, and seroprevalence was low in the young animals. In this research, it is revealed that the seroprevalence of BHV-1 in animals over 24 months of age was found to be higher than the lower age groups (<24 months). For this reason, the seroprevalence of BHV-1 in cows may reflect the proportion of BHV-1 carriers because, after a primary infection, the virus stays latent in neural ganglions that innervate genital or respiratory mucosae and maybe re-excreted on immuno-suppressive stimuli, such stress after shipment and calving [36] . With respect, the sex, the high prevalence in female might be attributed to the use of infected bulls for natural service and infected semen for artificial insemination [39] . The fact that animals were not vaccinated and that all age-groups had high seroprevalence indicates that the viral pathogens respiratory are naturally circulating in this population. So is urgently needed to establish measures for the epidemiological control and prevention of these diseases with the aim to decrease their incidence. Therefore, vaccination of animals could be considered. The distribution of virus and risk factors identification is important to establish prevention and control programs against economically important diseases such as BPI-3V, BRSV, BVDV, and BHV-1.",
