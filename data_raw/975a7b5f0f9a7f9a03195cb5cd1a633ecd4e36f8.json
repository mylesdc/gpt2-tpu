Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, a programmed \u060a1 ribosomal frameshift (\u060a1 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that \u060a1 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3= RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient \u060a1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses.",

With few exceptions, \u060a1 PRF occurs on specific \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of \u060a1 PRF in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of \u060a1 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a \"ribosome sink\") to downregulate synthesis of the 3=-encoded replication proteins.",

The latter encompasses a number of divergent viruses, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), rat theilovirus (RTV), and Saffold virus (SAFV). The approximately 8-kb genome contains a long open reading frame (ORF) that is translated as a polyprotein and subsequently processed by the virus-encoded 3C protease (1) (2) (3) . Separation of the L-1ABCD-2A and 2BC-3ABCD components, however, occurs cotranslationally via a process termed \"StopGo\" or \"Stop-Carry on\" (4-6) (Fig. 1 ). This unusual proteolysis-independent but ribosome-dependent mechanism is mediated by the amino acid motif D(V/I)ExNPG|P (where the symbol \"|\" represents the junction between 2A and 2B), together with less conserved but nonetheless functionally important upstream amino acids, which prevent the formation of a peptide bond between Gly and Pro but allow the continuation of translation with up to near-100% efficiency (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .",

            "text": "Many RNA viruses contain sequences that stimulate a proportion of ribosomes to undergo a \u03ea1 frameshift and to continue translating in an alternative reading frame. Where functionally utilized, this is termed programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting (\u03ea1 PRF). In eukaryotic systems, the stimulatory elements for \u03ea1 PRF typically involve a \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequence, where the shift in reading frame actually occurs, and a downstream RNA stem-loop or pseudoknot structure. The consensus motif for the shift site sequence is X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX normally represents any three identical nucleotides (though certain exceptions occur, including GGU), YYY represents AAA or UUU, Z represents any nucleotide except G, and underscores separate codons in the initial reading frame (12) . During the frameshift, the P-and A-site tRNAs detach from the zero frame codons XXY and YYZ and re-pair in the \u03ea1 frame to XXX and YYY. Frameshifting on a suitable shift site is stimulated to high levels (typically to a final \u03ea1 PRF efficiency of 5 to 45%, depending on the particular frameshift sequence) by a downstream stimulatory element usually in the form of an RNA pseudoknot or a stem-loop structure, separated from the shift site by a 5-to 9-nucleotide (nt) spacer (13, 14) . RNA structures at this distance from the shift site are thought to be located at the mRNA unwinding site of the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome when the shift site sequence is located within the decoding center (15, 16) . Failure to efficiently unwind the RNA structure-perhaps due to the presentation of an unusual topology-is thought to interfere with ribosome progressivity and may also induce tension within the mRNA that leads to uncoupling and subsequent realignment of the codon-anticodon duplexes (15, 17, 18) .",

This mutation was shown previously to inhibit StopGo from occurring, thereby fusing the 2A and 2B (or 2B*) proteins together, and this mutant was constructed to assess the relative importance of StopGo and frameshifting for TMEV replication and to assess whether StopGo affects frameshifting.

To investigate this, we used metabolic labeling to quantify viral protein production. In TMEV, the frameshifting efficiency cannot be robustly estimated simply by analyzing the ratio of upstream and downstream products for WT virus, due to the presence of intermediate polyprotein processing products, as well as potential differences in protein turnover rates. However, by normalizing WT protein levels to the corresponding levels for the SS mutant-in which proteins encoded upstream and downstream of the shift site are expected to be produced in equimolar amounts-we can at least partly correct for these confounding factors.",

(Fig. 3A) , indicating that a substantial proportion of ribosomes leave the polyprotein frame in the vicinity of the frameshift site and that this departure is mediated by the sequence of the predicted frameshift site. This is most obvious when the intensities of the 2C and VP1 proteins are compared. The intensity of each band depends on the number of methionines present and the abundance of the protein. There is clearly much more of the downstream product 2C relative to VP1 in the SS sample than in the WT, LVWT, and SCM samples.",

Previously, frameshifting in the related EMCV was shown to depend upon virus infection and on at least 50 nt of the 3= sequence (19) . The EMCV 3= sequence is predicted to form a stem-loop at an unusual distance from the shift site. However, the role of the predicted structure in EMCV frameshifting remains uncertain, as all mutations tested in a reporter system-even ones predicted to restore the stem-loop structure but with an altered sequence-inhibited frameshifting (19) . A stemloop with similar spacing (14 nt) is also predicted in TMEV ( Fig.  2A) . To investigate the important elements for TMEV frameshifting, we cloned the relevant region into a dual-luciferase reporter construct, pIDluc, which is a modified version of pDluc (24, 25) . As picornavirus infection results in host translational shutoff, pDluc was adapted to contain the EMCV IRES to allow cap-independent translation during viral infection. The TMEV WT shift site sequence (G_GUU_UUU) or mutated shift site sequence (SS; A_GUG_UUU), together with 6 nt of upstream sequence and 92 nt of downstream sequence (including the predicted stem-loop structure), was cloned between the Renilla and firefly luciferase ORFs in pIDluc such that frameshifting is required for expression of the firefly ORF. Two additional changes were introduced: a or their tagged equivalents, and frameshifting efficiencies were calculated from radiolabeled products as described in Fig. 3C . All viruses were normalized by SS; thus, the frameshifting efficiency for SS is zero by definition. Negative frameshifting efficiencies are likely an artifact of measurement errors and/or biological variability. Each bar represents the mean value (\u03ee standard deviation) from three biological repeats (the three untagged WT and LVWT data points are also used in Fig. 3C ). (C) Western blot of virus-infected cell lysates. BHK-21 cells were infected with V5-tagged viruses at MOI of 1 for LVSS, 5 for SS, and 10 for WT and LVWT, and lysates were prepared when cytopathic effect was extensive. Fivefold-smaller amounts of the LVWT and LVSS samples were loaded to give band intensities similar to those of the WT and SS samples, where only proteins generated by StopGo failure are detected. The proteins with the GP-to-LV mutation may migrate slightly faster than the wild-type ones. Samples were run on bis-Tris gels with 6 M urea and MOPS buffer, which results in altered mobility of the prestained 14-kDa and 17-kDa markers. (D) Mass spectrometric analysis of tagged products. Lysates from BHK-21 cells infected with V5-or HA-tagged TMEV LVWT were immunoprecipitated with V5 or HA antibodies, respectively, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Products migrating at the expected size for 2A-tag-2B* were subjected to in-gel trypsin digest, and peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Fragmentation ions are shown for the shift site peptide derived from V5-tagged 2A-2B* (top), a peptide consistent with 3C-Pro cleavage of tagged 2A-2B at the conserved Q|G encoded just downstream of the frameshift site (middle), and the shift site peptide derived from HA-tagged 2A-2B* (bottom). Amino acids derived from the V5 or HA tag are in green. The b-and y-series ions correspond to N-and C-terminal fragments. See Fig. S1 in the supplemental material for the fragmentation spectra. Below, the nucleotide sequence in the vicinity of the shift site G_GUU_UUU is shown, with conceptual amino acid translations in all three reading frames. The C-terminal end of the frameshift tryptic peptide is underlined in green, and the C-terminal end of the 2B cleavage peptide is in blue. (E) Low-molecular-mass radiolabeled TMEV translation products. BHK-21 cells were infected with WT, SS, LVWT, or LVSS viruses or their tagged equivalents at an MOI of 10 or mock infected. Cells were labeled from 8 to 9 h p.i. and harvested at 9 h p.i., and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. U-to-C mutation (removing the \u03ea1 frame stop codon) was introduced into all plasmids to allow \u03ea1 frame translation to continue into the downstream firefly luciferase, and a CAA-to-UAA mutation was introduced to generate a stop codon in the zero frame at the third codon after the shift site. The latter mutation was introduced as preliminary experiments indicated that, without it, the extended C-terminal tail that is appended to the Renilla luciferase when frameshifting failed to occur was inhibiting its enzymatic activity. An in-frame control (IFC) in which the firefly ORF was placed in the same frame as the Renilla ORF by inserting an extra U at the end of the G_GUU_UUU shift site was also constructed.",

As expected, pIDluc SS failed to support frameshifting either with or without virus infection. To test whether frameshift stimulation by TMEV infection is restricted to the TMEV frameshift signal, two other dual-luciferase constructs harboring unrelated frameshift signals from infectious bronchitis coronavirus (pDluc IBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (p2luc HIV) (26) , and their corresponding IFCs were tested alongside the TMEV constructs.

However, the predicted stem-loop in EMCV and TMEV is separated from the shift site by 13 or 14 nt (19) . In order to evaluate whether the predicted stem-loop is involved in the stimulation of frameshifting in TMEV, three mutants were generated ( Fig. 5C ): (i) pIDluc SL5=, where the first three bases of the 5= half of the stem were mutated (5=-GGU-3= to 5=-CCA-3=); (ii) pIDluc SL3=, where the last three bases of the 3= half of the stem were mutated (5=-ACC-3= to 5=-UGG-3=); and (iii) pIDluc SL5=\u03e93=, where both sets of mutations were combined so as to restore the predicted structure but with reversed base pairings. For each mutant, a corresponding IFC was constructed. Frameshifting efficiencies for both pIDluc SL3= and pIDluc SL5= were found to be negligible even with TMEV infection (Fig. 5D ). In contrast, the frameshifting efficiency for the restoration mutant (pIDluc SL5=\u03e93=) was \u03f319% when stimulated by TMEV infection, similar to that for pIDluc WT. This strongly indicates that the predicted 3= RNA stem-loop structure does indeed form and plays a critical role in the stimulation of frameshifting in TMEV.",

Frameshift stimulation also involves a downstream RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing (14 nt) from the frameshift site. While canonical \u03ea1 PRF-stimulatory RNA structures (5-to 9-nt spacing) are expected to be positioned partly within the mRNA entrance channel at the onset of frameshifting, the cardiovirus stem-loop structure will be located close to the leading edge of the ribosome when the P and A sites are positioned on the shift site sequence. One possible explanation for the observations may be that a virus protein, or virus-stimulated host protein, binds to the stem-loop structure and that this RNA-protein complex is able to mimic a canonical \u03ea1 PRF-stimulatory RNA structure at a different spacing or otherwise interact with the ribosome to promote \u03ea1 PRF. Recent work on Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (family Arteriviridae) has demonstrated that in at least one other case of ribosomal frameshifting, the 3= stimulator involves mRNA-protein interactions (27) .",

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the kinetics of polyprotein processing may be modified in the mutants, the very high efficiency of the TMEV frameshifting signal is consistent with recent metabolic labeling and ribosome profiling data for the cardiovirus EMCV, where frameshifting was found to be 50 to 70% efficient (R. Ling , J. D. Jones, I. Brierley, and A. E. Firth, unpublished data). Why frameshifting is noticeably less efficient in the context of the dual-luciferase reporter system (although still TMEV infection dependent) is uncertain, although similar observations have been reported for EMCV (7% in pDluc [20] ). One possibility is that distal frameshift-stimulatory elements exist in the virus genome that are not present in the dual-luciferase reporter vector. A more likely explanation, however, is that the reduced frameshifting efficiency is a consequence of a relative buildup of the nonframeshift product (Renilla luciferase) in cells prior to the onset of virus-stimulated frameshifting. A reduced frameshifting efficiency would perhaps also be observed if the dual-luciferase reporter mRNA and \"virus transactivator\" were not appropriately localized in the cell or if the reporter was present at an inappropriate molar ratio.",

However, in EMCV, frameshifting results in the production of a much larger transframe 2B* protein (128 or 129 aa, depending on the isolate) than in TMEV (14 aa). In EMCV, a mutation (PTC2) that truncated 2B*, but that was not expected to interfere with frameshifting, produced an intermediate phenotype, suggesting that both the 2B* protein and frameshifting per se are functionally important (19) . In TMEV, frameshifting is critical for efficient viral growth in cell culture, but it is unclear whether the 14-aa 2B* has a function in its own right or whether it is simply the by-product of a functionally important frameshift. Frameshifting in TMEV diverts 74 to 82% of ribosomes out of the polyprotein reading frame, thus greatly reducing expression of the 3=-encoded replication proteins relative to the 5=-encoded structural proteins. This, in itself, may provide a selective advantage, as the structural proteins are required in much greater quantities than the replication proteins. Although the mutant with 2B* extended (the SCM mutant) exhibited a slight defect in growth kinetics compared to WT, this could be due to a reduction in frameshifting efficiency since the mutation is within the frameshift-stimulatory stem-loop structure and radiolabeling indicated that this mutant had a decreased frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 3C ). At this time, however, a functional role for TMEV 2B* cannot be ruled out.",

However, consistent with previous results (22) , our data show that StopGo in TMEV is not crucial for efficient viral growth in cell culture, as judged by the similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotypes exhibited by LVWT and WT viruses. In addition, inhibiting StopGo had no or only a slight detrimental effect on the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting (Fig. 3C ). It has been suggested that the apparent redundancy of StopGo in TMEV may partly stem from the presence of a potential 3C-Pro cleavage site within 2B (QG, encoded just downstream from the shift site; also conserved in EMCV) (22) . Cleavage at QG in a StopGo mutant would yield 2A fused to the N-terminal 9 amino acids of 2B (2A-2B N ) and a separate N-terminally truncated 2B. Consistent with this, no product of the expected size of 2A-2B (\u03f330 kDa) was observed in the radiolabeling experiment using LVWT virus. Instead, a product (or products) migrating slightly more slowly than WT 2A was observed, consistent with either 2A-2B* or 2A-2B N . Mass-spectrometric analysis of V5-tagged LVWT confirmed that V5-tagged products migrating at this size comprise both V5tagged 2A-2B* and V5-tagged 2A-2B N . If N-terminally truncated 2B can carry out all necessary 2B functions, then it would appear that the importance of StopGo is to produce the correct C terminus of 2A and/or the correct N terminus of 2B*.

In many RNA viruses, transcriptional or translational control mechanisms are used to downregulate production of the latter relative to the former (reviewed in reference 28). However, in viruses that use a single-polyprotein expression strategy, such mechanisms would appear to be unavailable, and any regulation of relative protein levels must normally occur posttranslationally, e.g., via polyprotein processing, protein turnover, the production of inactive conformers, or sequestration of enzymatic proteins in inclusion bodies or the nucleus. We suggest that highly efficient \u03ea1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of a single-polyprotein expression strategy, allowing efficient downregulation of replication protein synthesis while simultaneously releasing translational resources for enhanced structural protein synthesis.",
