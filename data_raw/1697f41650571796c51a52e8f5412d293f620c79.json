Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. Conclusion. e FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.",

If testing is completed, it is usually done on an easily accessible specimen type (e.g., throat swab or nasopharyngeal [9] (NP) swab) and is generally limited to targeted pathogens (e.g., influenza virus). However, in patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill, a rapid, syndromic panel may be of benefit. Furthermore, patients with persistent or progressive symptoms may require a more extensive diagnostic evaluation, including bronchoscopy with collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. e utility of FARP testing using NP swabs and BAL specimens collected from immunocompromised hosts (ICH) has been investigated [2, 7, 10] .

Once enrolled, the patients' electronic medical records were reviewed and the following information was obtained: demographics (age and sex), presence and reason of immunosuppression, microbiology testing data from the BAL specimen (e.g., cultures and PCR), specifics of the respiratory illness (e.g., cough and wheezing), and other clinical or radiographic features.

            "text": "e results of this study suggest that the FARP may be useful in the evaluation of ICH with suspicion of lower respiratory tract infection, as the yield of this test was higher in ICH (32%) compared to non-ICH patients (8%) (p \ufffd 0.02) ( Tables 2 and 3 ). Twenty-seven ICH patients (27%) had a positive NP FARP, with 19/27 (70%) having the same pathogen(s) detected from the paired BAL sample. e remaining 8 (30%) patients had a negative FARP result in BAL fluid (Table 2) . is suggests that if a pathogen is detected from the NP swab by the FARP, performing the multiplex assay on BAL fluid is unlikely to provide additional yield for pathogens included on the FARP. Among the ICH group, 24/100 (24%) had a pathogen detected from BAL fluid by the FARP. e majority (79%; 19/24) of these patients had the same pathogen(s) identified from the NP specimen, while 5 (21%) had a negative FARP result on the NP swab (Table 2) . We conclude that if the FARP is negative on a NP swab, there may be additional value of testing BAL fluid by the multiplex assay. It should be noted that regardless of the FARP results on an NP swab, proceeding with bronchoscopy/BAL may still be indicated in ICH patients with suspected infection since the FARP does not test for certain pathogens (e.g., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis, Nocardia spp., and Mycobacteria spp.) that can be important causes of disease in the immunosuppressed population. In support of this, in our cohort, those with a positive FARP on either NP or BAL samples had an additional pathogen(s) detected by routine microbiology studies in 31% of cases. Furthermore, among those patients with negative FARP results on both NP and BAL specimens, there was an additional yield from routine microbiology studies on the BAL fluid in 23.5% of cases (Table 5 ). e yield of routine microbiology testing (e.g., cultures and individual real-time PCR assays) in the ICH cohort was 25%, compared to the FARP being positive in 27% of NP swabs and 24% of BAL specimens. ese results suggest that the FARP assay may serve as a rapid alternative to routine testing for those targets that are included on the multiplex panel. Furthermore, FARP testing may play an important role in patient management decisions, including infection control and antimicrobial stewardship [11] . If a bacterial pathogen is detected, broad-spectrum coverage could be modified to offer more specific antimicrobial therapy. In contrast, if a viral pathogen is detected and bacterial cultures remain negative, it may be prudent to discontinue antibiotics and initiate targeted antiviral therapy [11] . Bronchoscopy with BAL is routinely ordered in ICH patients at our institution. Our study showed that standard microbiology studies on BAL fluid had a yield of 25% in this cohort, which is comparable to the yield of the FARP (24%). We believe that the comparable yield of FARP in this population provides additional support for this noninvasive test as a reasonable adjunct to BAL testing in the ICH. Many ICH patients with respiratory illness are placed on empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy before the BAL is collected, which can confound the yield of BAL cultures. Multiplex molecular testing, however, may not be affected by the prior administration of antibiotics. We propose that when used in conjunction with routine microbiology studies, FARP testing on BAL fluid may have a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of ICH patients with respiratory illnesses.",
