To begin to bridge these gaps, we conducted a dual analysis of Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and host cell transcriptomes during lytic infection. We analyzed the MCMV transcriptome during lytic infection using both classical cDNA cloning and sequencing of viral transcripts and next generation sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq). We also investigated the host transcriptome using RNA-Seq combined with differential gene expression analysis, biological pathway analysis, and gene ontology analysis. We identify numerous novel spliced and unspliced transcripts of MCMV. Unexpectedly, the most abundantly transcribed viral genes are of unknown function. We found that the most abundant viral transcript, recently identified as a noncoding RNA regulating cellular microRNAs, also codes for a novel protein. To our knowledge, this is the first viral transcript that functions both as a noncoding RNA and an mRNA. We also report that lytic infection elicits a profound cellular response in fibroblasts. Highly upregulated and induced host genes included those involved in inflammation and immunity, but also many unexpected transcription factors and host genes related to development and differentiation. Many top downregulated and repressed genes are associated with functions whose roles in infection are obscure, including host long intergenic noncoding RNAs, antisense RNAs or small nucleolar RNAs. Correspondingly, many differentially expressed genes cluster in biological pathways that may shed new light on cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. Together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular warfare at the virus-host interface and suggest new areas of research to advance the understanding and treatment of cytomegalovirus-associated diseases.",

In adults, HCMV can cause a spectrum of diseases in immune compromised patients involving multiple organs and tissues and is a primary cause of graft loss in transplant patients [1, 2] . In recent years, HCMV has been linked to lung injury in trauma patients [3] and is also postulated to act as a cofactor in atherosclerosis and some cancers [4, 5] . For these reasons, there is an urgent need for an effective vaccine and new antiviral intervention strategies that mitigate the toxicity and drug resistance shortcomings of current antiviral drugs [1, 6] .",

More recently Cheng and colleagues [14] proposed additional changes after sequencing isolates to measure genome stability after in vitro and in vivo passage. Also, Lacaze and colleagues [13] extended the microarray approach to include probes specific to both strands of the genome, leading to the discovery of noncoding and bi-directional transcription at late stages of MCMV infection. Finally, a recent transcriptomic analysis of newly synthesized RNA in MCMV infected fibroblasts [15] applied RNA-Seq technology to study regulation of viral gene expression and identified a very early peak of viral gene transcriptional activity at 1-2 hours post infection followed by rapid cellular countermeasures but did not attempt to re-annotate MCMV genome.",

Analysis of cDNA libraries is a well-proven approach to analyze viral transcripts based on isolation of long transcripts, molecular cloning of the transcripts, and traditional Sanger-based sequencing of the cDNA clones. Traditional cloning has many advantages, including isolation of novel transcripts that may not be identified by probe-based technologies, as well as precise analysis of transcript splice sites and transcript 39 ends. The introduction of massively parallel sequencing techniques represents a major new technology to study gene expression. Basically, RNA (total or fractionated) is converted to a library of smaller cDNA fragments. Adaptors are added to the fragments, and the shorter fragments are sequenced in a high-throughput manner using next generation sequencing technology. This RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach is free of selection biases associated with traditional cloning or probe-based methods and allows for the entire transcriptome to be analyzed in a quantitative manner (reviewed in [21] ).",

We identify numerous novel spliced and unspliced transcripts of MCMV. Unexpectedly, the most abundantly transcribed viral genes are of unknown function. We found that the most abundant viral transcript, recently identified as a noncoding RNA regulating cellular microRNAs, also codes for a novel protein. To our knowledge, this is the first viral transcript that functions both as a noncoding RNA and an mRNA. Infection alters expression of many unexpected host genes, including many noncoding RNA genes. Correspondingly, many cluster in unexpected biological pathways that may shed new light on cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. Together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular warfare at the virus-host interface and suggest new areas of research to advance the understanding and treatment of cytomegalovirus-associated diseases.

            "text": "(1) Novel antisense transcripts. Excluding 20 cDNA clones that mapped to intergenic regions, 275 (64%) of cDNA clones were in the sense (S) orientation, 39 (9%) were antisense (AS), and 114 (27%) overlapped more than one gene in both S and AS orientations relative to original annotation provided by Rawlinson and colleagues [9] . These designations were reevaluated according to the current NCBI reference sequence (NC_004065) in which AS transcripts to hypothetical or putative proteins were revised as S transcripts due to lack of evidence for the predicted sense transcript. If AS transcripts that overlapped hypothetical proteins also overlapped S transcripts in this library, the AS designation was preserved. According to these criteria, 431 (97%) transcripts were in S orientation, only 4 (0.09%) were in AS orientation, and 9 (2%) overlapped more than one gene in both S and AS orientations. (2) Transcripts overlapping more than one currently annotated genes. Several cDNA clones were isolated that overlap more than one currently annotated gene. For example, four cDNA clones in our library overlapped both the m15 and m16 genes. The longest of these clones specifies a 1673 bp transcript, whereas current annotation predicts two genes of 908 bp (m15) and 632 bp (m16). These data suggest the possibility that several ORFs are translated from unexpectedly long or polycistronic transcripts. Unusually long and polycistronic transcripts have recently been shown to be a feature of HCMV transcriptome [18] . (3) The absence of transcripts in currently annotated regions. Several gene regions were not well represented in the cDNA cloning study. For example, no cDNA clones overlapping m01 or m170 were found in this study, and these regions had the lowest RPKM reads by RNA-Seq of 132 and 141, respectively (gray histograms in Figures 1 and 2 and Table S3 ), consistent with earlier gene array-based studies [12] . For comparison, the well-defined MCMV genes m04 and m138, both represented with multiple clones in our cDNA library, have RPKM values of 14,137 and 16,935 respectively. Because some viral transcripts with higher RPKM reads were not represented in the classical cDNA library (for example, an RPKM of 2967 for the M98 gene), we conclude the cDNA library cloning did not capture all viral transcripts. Nevertheless, the failure to identify clones in regions poorly represented by RNA-Seq data suggests that further attention is required to prove or disprove the existence of genes predicted by in silico (ORF) analysis. (4) Novel spliced transcripts. One of the most striking aspects of the cloning study was the abundance of novel spliced transcripts. A total of 22 novel spliced transcripts were cloned in this study as well as spliced transcripts reported by others. A complete list of spliced transcripts identified in this and other studies is provided in Table S4 . One of the most abundant novel spliced transcripts identified in this study maps to the M116 gene (8 cDNA clones). Current annotation for M116 predicts a protein of 645 AA, whereas the clones in this study predict a novel truncated protein product. Splicing results in a change of open reading frame at amino acid residue 350 of the currently annotated M116 protein and introduction of a new stop codon at position 401 (Dataset S2). By far the most abundant novel spliced transcript is that overlapping m169 in the S orientation, and m168 in the AS orientation and is discussed in detail below.",

This antibody was used in immunoblot analysis of cell lysates prepared from mock-infected cells and cells infected with wild-type (WT) BAC-derived Smith strain virus, or various multi-gene and single-gene mutant virus strains.

The difference in MAT transcript abundance between WT and the m169-mut virus was lost by 48 hours after infection. However, we observed that MAT protein levels were similar in cells infected with the WT and m169-mut viruses at 24 and 48 hrs after infection ( Figure 3H ).

            "text": "In addition to providing valuable insight into transcript structure, RNA-Seq analysis revealed several new facets of the viral transcriptome. First, accumulation of individual viral transcripts varies by several orders of magnitude. Figure 4A depicts the number of RNA-Seq reads mapped against the MCMV genome in which rows 1, 2 and 3 visualize the data with the maximum number reads set to 50,000, 5000, and 500, respectively. Validating the classical cloning study, the most abundant transcript identified by RNA-Seq is the MAT transcript. Enumeration (RPKM) of the most abundant transcripts is presented in Figures 4B and 4C , and shows that after the MAT transcript, the most highly expressed genes are m119, M116, and m48, all genes without assigned functions. Also highly expressed are the immune evasion genes m04 and m138, M55 (glycoprotein B), and additional genes of unknown functions (M73 and m15). Second, as shown by comparing Figure 4B to C, both the overall magnitude of expression and the ranking of the abundance of different transcripts vary according to annotation used for the RPKM analysis. Third, analysis of reads mapped at the highest resolution ( Figure 4A , row 3) indicates that most of the viral genome is transcribed to some degree. Remarkably, 30 or 35% of the reads mapped to intergenic regions, depending on annotation ( Figure 4D ). This percentage is reduced to 14% when annotation is modified to reflect the correct MAT gene structure identified in this study. RNA-Seq also detected significant transcription in m74-M75 ( Figure S4 ), M85-M87 and M88-m90 ( Figure 4E ) intergenic regions. In contrast, the transcriptional profile of the annotated M87 shows less transcriptional activity than the adjacent intergenic regions. Similarly, RNA-Seq identified transcription from genes that were not isolated in the classical cDNA library or in previous studies using microarray technology [12, 13] . A detailed analysis of the sensitivity of this RNA-Seq study to previous studies is provided in Supplemental Datasets S1A-C. We also compared our RNA-Seq data to a recent RNA-Seq analysis of the MCMV transcriptome using BAC-derived WT virus on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts [15] . As shown in Supplemental Figure S1 , the profiles obtained from these two different RNA-Seq experiments are remarkably similar despite using different sequencing platforms and library generation approaches. Also, either seven or eight of the 10 most abundant genes were identical in both datasets (Supplemental Dataset S1C). Minor differences in abundance of some transcripts can be attributed to differences in the time points analyzed in these two studies as well as the fact that our analysis achieved an order of magnitude greater sequencing depth (compare reads analyzed for each histogram set in Figure S1 ).",

In both regions multiple transcripts were detected with different temporal expression patterns. Smaller transcripts tended to accumulate at later time points, a feature previously reported for certain transcripts in both HCMV and MCMV [22] [23] [24] . In the m15-m16 region 5 transcripts were cloned, all of which overlapped the predicted m15 and m16 genes, and one transcript was spliced ( Figure 5A ). The RNA-Seq profile Figure 5 . Verification of new transcripts by northern blot. Balb/c MEF cells were infected with BAC derived Smith virus and harvested at indicated times post infection. Total RNA was separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membrane and incubated with probes specific for S and AS transcripts. RNA integrity and loading was evaluated by inspecting 28S (not shown) and 18S rRNA bands under UV light after transfer to membrane. Transcripts in the m15-16 (A), m19-m20 (B), M116 (C) and M71-m74 (D) gene regions were analyzed (Due to smiling effects during gel electrophoresis for the image shown in 4A and C, the ladder was not accurate for inner lanes of the gel and the position of the ribosomal bands was therefore used to estimate the band sizes). Predicted genes (Rawlinson's annotation) are depicted as empty arrows, while thin black arrows show longest transcripts cloned in our cDNA library as well as clones used to generate probes (marked with *). 39 ends of transcripts are marked with arrowheads. The nucleotide coordinates relative to Smith sequence (NC_004065.1) of isolated transcripts are given below thin arrows, while the names of the clones are written above. Thin gray lines show isolated transcripts that cannot be detected with the probe. Gray histograms showRNA-Seqreads aligned to MCMV genome. Maximal possible exposure times were used to ensure even low abundance transcripts are detected and are noted on the blots. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003611.g005 ( Figure 5A , gray histogram) also strongly indicated transcription that spans both predicted genes. Consistent with our cDNA library, no antisense transcripts were detected while the sense probe detected 5 transcripts ( Figure 5A , bands 1-5). The 39 end of all cDNA clones end at or close to nucleotide position 15700 (Supplemental Table S2 ) and RNA-Seq data alignment to MCMV genome indicates a sudden drop in reads around this nucleotide position. Assuming that transcripts in this region are coterminal, band sizes predict transcript initiation sites in m11, m12, m13 or m14, and m15 ( Figure 5A , bands 1-4). Similar results were found in this region in cells infected with wild isolates of MCMV (Alec Redwood, personal communication). While the smallest band observed by northern analysis ( Figure 5A , band 5) corresponds in size to the novel spliced transcript, E253 (566 bp), we could not confirm splicing by PCR using intronflanking primers (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely this spliced transcript represents an aberrant transcript or a result of intramolecular template switching during reverse transcription [25] .",

This is consistent with our cloning study where 4 transcripts have been isolated in this region and none overlap m19 in the sense orientation (Supplemental Table S2 ). Evidence from the cDNA library and RNA-Seq alignment (Table  S2 and Figure 5B ) indicates that 5 bands detected in northern are co-terminal, with the 39 end located close to nucleotide position 20430. The largest band at 4 kb ( Figure 5B , band 1) is detectable at 30 and 60 hours PI and we predict that this transcript initiates in M23. We failed to detect transcripts between the m20 and m25 genes consistent with previous studies [12] and northern analyses using mutant viruses lacking genes in this region (data not shown). The lack of cDNA clones can be explained by low abundance and size of this transcript, as well as by propensity of cDNA libraries to enrich 39 ends. The band slightly smaller than 3 kb ( Figure 5B , band 2) shows a peak accumulation at 60 hours PI and is consistent with a transcript overlapping m19-m21 (approx locations 20430-23220, 2.79 kb). The band of approximately 2 kb ( Figure 5B , band 3) shows peak accumulation 10 hours PI. Based on the RNA-Seq profile this band could represent transcripts that initiate at nucleotide position 22060. Finally, the late time points are dominated by smaller transcripts of approximately 1 kb ( Figure 5B , band 5; predicted start site at 21440) which correspond in size to the cDNA clones detected in our study. In short, northern analyses support the conclusion that transcripts overlapping multiple genes in the m15-m16 region and m19-m20 region accumulate in infected cells and indicate that additional, larger transcripts are transcribed in these regions which have yet to be characterized.",

Northern blot analysis ( Figure 5C ) identified a strong band of appropriate size (1.6 kb) that starts to accumulate at IE times and peaks at E and L times after infection. Due to the small intron and high abundance of this transcript, unspliced transcripts could not be definitively resolved by northern analysis but were confirmed by PCR using primers flanking the intron ( Figure S3) . Additionally, northern analysis detected another less abundant band of approximately 3 kb. Leatham and colleagues [26] have detected a band of similar size in the homologous region in HCMV of 3.2 kb that encompasses UL119-115 genes.

[23] of multiple spliced transcripts that share exon 2. Bands 5-7 ( Figure 5D ) correspond to previously reported m60, m73 and M73.5 spliced transcripts. In our cloning study four isolated clones correspond to M73.5 transcripts (represented by the longest clone, L443) and one to M73 (L33) (Supplemental Table S4 ). Transcripts corresponding to m60 were not isolated in the cloning study, however the RNA-Seq profile in the region corresponding to m60 exon1 shows active transcription ( Figure S4D ). We have also detected a 1.1 kb band ( Figure 5D , band 6) that corresponds to longer M73 and M75 transcripts, and bands corresponding to unspliced transcripts of M73 and M73.5 (approx. 2 kb, Figure 5D , band 4). In addition to these previously published transcripts, we have also cloned one novel spliced transcript from this region, E180. In accordance with work in the m60 region [23] , we propose M71S as a designation for this novel gene. Like other spliced transcripts from this region, E180 shares exon 2 with other transcripts while its splice donor site is located at 102830. The spliced nature of this transcript has been confirmed by PCR ( Figure S4C) , however more analyses are needed to determine its exact 59 start site. Northern analysis revealed a band of 0.5 kb ( Figure 5D , band 7) that corresponds in size to the E180 spliced transcript whereas the unspliced version is detected around 3 kb ( Figure 5D, band 3) . In addition, a band of similar size (3.5 kb) transcribed from the plus genomic strand detected by the L147 probe ( Figure Figure S4B ) could correspond to the unspliced version of E180. All probes used in this region detected bands transcribed from negative genomic strand that correspond to those previously reported by Rapp et al. [27] . Based on additional northern blots using cDNA clones L69 (AS to m72) and L147 (AS to m74) ( Figure S4A and B) as well as previous reports [23, 27] we conclude that the 5 kb transcript starts in m75 and ends in m72 and corresponds to transcript encoding gH while the 3 kb transcript starts in m74 and ends in m72 and corresponds to transcript encoding dUTPase (Supplemental Figure S4 ). Additional very large transcripts transcribed from plus or minus genomic strands detected by the L42 and L147 probes, respectively, have yet to be characterized but underscore the complex transcriptional patterns in this region.",

Among molecular and cellular functions, cell growth and proliferation were the top ranked perturbed functions, consistent with known effects of lytic MCMV infection of cells. Nervous system development and function is at the top of the list of physiological and developmental biofunctions, followed by organismal and tissue development and, surprisingly, behavior with 92 associated genes. DE genes were also evaluated for canonical pathways in the Ingenuity library ( Figure 7B) . The pathways most affected by MCMV included G-protein coupled receptor signaling followed by pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and GABA receptor signaling. Together, these analyses point to known and expected consequences of infection at the cellular level (i.e., cell growth and proliferation, G-protein coupled receptor signaling) and physiological level (i.e. nervous system development) but also highlight unexpected cell and molecular functions, as well as physiological systems and disorders that may advance the understanding of CMV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "There are four major findings from the analysis of the MCMV transcriptome. First, we demonstrate novel transcripts of MCMV including novel splice variants, transcripts that map to noncoding regions, and transcripts overlapping multiple genes. Earlier, we reported similar novel transcripts of HCMV through analysis of a classical cDNA library [16] . This study revealed a dramatic increase in the complexity of viral gene products compared to currently available predictions and its findings were later on confirmed by RNA-Seq analysis [17] . A more recent analysis of HCMV translational products [18] by ribosomal footprinting identified over 700 translated ORFs -a strikingly high number compared to annotated genes. This discrepancy is, at least in part, a consequence of the polycistronic nature of HCMV transcripts which appear to code for many more ORFs than previously predicted (internal in frame or out-of-frame ORFs, uORFs) as well as ORFs coming from antisense or dedicated short transcripts. Our analysis demonstrated that the MCMV transcriptome is similarly complex: we identified several regions where multiple 39 co-terminal transcripts expressed in different temporal phases are being transcribed. Such transcripts have the potential to code for truncated protein forms or even completely new proteins as described for HCMV, suggesting that the size and complexity of the MCMV proteome, like the MCMV transcriptome, is currently underestimated. Accumulation of ncRNAs is also a prominent feature of the cytomegalovirus transcriptomes. Our RNA-Seq analysis shows intense transcription in previously described stable MCMV introns and in intergenic regions, consistent with abundant ncRNAs reported for HCMV and MCMV [16, 17, 33] . These findings have a profound implication for understanding studies of CMV genes functions and underscore the need for transcriptomic maps in addition to genomic maps depicting only ORFs. The functions of many MCMV genes have been elucidated by using deletion mutants [34] . However in a transcriptionally complex region of the genome any deletion will likely impact multiple transcripts and possibly multiple proteins resulting in complex phenotypes.",

Interestingly, preliminary estimates in our cloning study indicate that AS transcripts occur at much lower frequency than reported for HCMV [16] . There are likely to be additional AS transcripts of MCMV. Because we did not capture every known sense transcript of MCMV, we may presume that the cDNA cloning study did not capture all AS transcripts. In addition, the RNA-Seq analysis performed in this study was limited by the fact that the methods employed did not provide strand-specific information and could not identify novel AS transcripts. AS transcripts, even those expressed at low levels, may possess noncoding RNA functions and contribute to complexity of the proteome as has described for HCMV [20] . Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the number and nature of AS transcripts derived from MCMV and will be critical to generating definitive transcriptome and proteome maps of this virus. The cDNA library analysis does suggest that the extent of MCMV AS transcription is lower than that described for other herpesviruses, including HCMV. These results are consistent with a strand-specific RNA-Seq experiment performed by D\u00f6lken group [15] that also show poor AS transcription in comparison to sense counterparts. Very little antisense transcription was also noted for the anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV1) infecting eels [35] , though extensive antisense transcription was reported for other herpesviruses, including KSHV and MHVc68 [36, 37] . We conclude that different members of the Herpesviridae family differ in the extent of antisense transcription during lytic infection.",

This gene is also largely conserved in wild isolates of MCMV (Alec Redwood, personal communication and [38] ) and the protein is expressed by wild isolates tested in this study. MAT abundance may reflect its multiple functions. The 39 untranslated region (UTR) of this transcript facilitates degradation of murine miR-27, establishing that this transcript functions as a noncoding RNA molecule [19, 20] . Members of the alpha, beta, and gamma herpes virus subfamilies all encode for abundant, largely enigmatic noncoding RNAs including the latency associated transcript (LAT) of herpes simplex virus (HSV), EBNA RNAs of Esptein-Barr virus (EBV), the b2.7 transcript of HCMV, the PAN RNA of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) and the HSUR transcripts of herpesvirus Samiri (HVS) which also downregulates the cellular miR27 (reviewed in [39] ). In addition to the noncoding function of the MAT, we demonstrate that this transcript also encodes for a novel small protein of approximately 17 kDa.

MCMV encodes virally-derived chemokine homologs specified by the m131/m129 genes [46, 47] and at least one chemokine receptor homolog, M33 [48] . Numerous host chemokine receptors are also upregulated by infection, suggesting a remarkably complex interplay between MCMV-derived and host derived chemokine signaling during infection. Induction of inflammatory gene networks by MCMV also lends credence to the hypothesis that inflammatory responses link CMV infection to chronic diseases, such as chronic allograft rejection, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [2, 4, 5] .",

Recently, Insm1 was found to be strongly upregulated by HSV-1 infection and shown to promote HSV gene expression, probably by binding the HSV infected cell protein (ICP)0 promoter. [49] . This raises the intriguing possibility that INSM1 plays a similar role in promoting virus gene expression during MCMV infection. Another induced transcription factor induced at the transcript and protein level is engrailed-2 (EN2). This transcription factor is key to patterning cerebellar foliation during development [50] . We previously described a profound dysregulation of cerebellar development in brains of neonatal mice infected with MCMV [51] , suggesting a possible physiological link to regulation of this gene. Another top induced gene was the GABA receptor, Gabrq. Glutamate receptor signaling was also identified as significantly impacted canonical pathways in our dataset. In the developing brain GABA and glutamate receptors influence neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation or survival processes [52] . Whether and how these observations relate to our previous findings that MCMV infection of neonates results in decreased granular neuron proliferation and migration [51] are important areas for future study and may impact our understanding of neurological damage and sequelae associated with HCMV in congenitally-infected infants.",

This is particularly important as herpesviruses can control protein accumulation at the post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels [55] [56] [57] . We confirmed that the notch ligand, Jagged 2, is highly upregulated by infection at both the transcript and protein level. Notch signaling is a highly conserved signaling pathway that plays important roles in development, including neurogenesis and differentiation of immune cell subsets [58] . Jagged 2 is also upregulated by the alphaherpesviruses, HSV-1 and Psuedorabies viruses [59] . KSHV and EBV also exploit the notch signaling pathway to facilitate aspects of their life cycle [60] and notch signaling is proposed to influence HSV-2-induced interferon responses [61] . We show for the first time that the betaherpesvirus, MCMV, also influences notch signaling. Dysregulation of Jagged2 as a consequence of MCMV infection is highly interesting since it plays a role in important processes affected by CMV including inner ear development [62, 63] , generation of motor neurons [64] and differentiation of immune cell subsets [65, 66] .",

No drug was used to select for different temporal classes of transcripts and equal amounts of RNA from each time point were pooled prior to library construction. cDNA libraries were generated as described previously for HCMV [16] by following the instruction manual for the SuperScript Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen) with some minor modifications. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). A poly(T)-tailed PacI primer-adapter was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis (59-GCGGCCGCTTAATTAACC(T) 15 -39) . After sec-ond-strand synthesis, an EcoRI-PmeI adapter was added to the 59 end and cDNAs were cleaved with EcoRI and PacI. The EcoRI-PmeI adapter was generated by annealing following oligonucleotides: 59-AATTCCCGCGGGTTTAAACG-39 and 59-Pho-CGTTTAAACCCGCGGG-39. cDNA fragments were inserted into a modified pcDNA3.1(+) previously digested with EcoRI and PacI and transformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent E. coli cells (Stratagene, CA, USA).",

It is important to note that both ELAND and Bowtie aligners do not map splice junctions and thus give concordant results. Alignments were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) [72] . Differential gene expression was assessed by calculating RPKM (reads per kilobase of million mapped reads (RPKM) using SAMMate 2.6.1. release with EdgeR (http://sammate. sourceforge.net/) [73] . Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on filtered lists of differentially expressed genes (p,0.05) using GOrilla ranked lists analysis [31, 32] . Ingenuity Core Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) was used for gene interaction network and canonical pathway analysis. Gene lists were filtered for statistically significant differentially expressed genes (p,0.05) and a fold change cutoff of 2 was set to identify molecules whose expression was significantly differentially regulated. For network generation, these molecules (Network Eligible molecules), were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base based on their connectivity. The Functional Analysis of a network identified the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the molecules in the network. Right-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to confirm that biological functions and/or disease assigned to data sets were not due to chance. The nature of individual DE genes was also investigated using the Mouse Genome Informatics databases (http://www.informatics.jax.org/) [74] and Entrez Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) [75] .",

Membranes were reacted to DIG-labeled probes overnight at 67uC. For MAT detection, a DIG labeled double-stranded DNA probe was made using fragments corresponding to the MAT gene sequences derived from cDNA library clones E1, E125 and E134 using Roche's DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I. For all other northern blots, single-stranded DIG-labeled RNA probes were used generated using Roche's DIG Northern Starter Kit. Antisense probes were generated by in vitro transcription from T7 promoter present in pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing cDNA clones that harbor the desired gene fragments (Table 1) . Therefore antisense probes are identical to transcripts cloned in cDNA library and can detect transcripts antisense to cDNA clones. To generate sense probes, T3 promoter was added to 59 end of complimentary strand of the gene fragments used for antisense probes by PCR ( Table 1 ). The PCR fragments were then in vitro transcribed and DIG labeled using T3 RNA polymerase. Care was taken to generate sense probes of length comparable to corresponding antisense probes.",

The view of the complete genome is shown at the top with 4 areas magnified below (labeled A-D) and the number of reads displayed are noted on the side. Since viral genes display a wide range of expression levels, the whole genome view is shown in wide data range (upper panel) more suitable for displaying highly transcribed regions and a narrowed data range (lower panel) that is more suitable for less transcribed regions. As can be seen, the profiles of the compared alignments are remarkably similar, the only differences being abundance of certain transcripts which are due to different time points analyzed in comparison to the pooled data of our RNA-Seq and significantly greater depth of at least one order of magnitude of our data in comparison to Marcinowski data.
