            "text": "Pneumonia severity index (PSI) is an important scoring system that can assess the severity of community acquired pneumonia and determine admission status. However, there is a lack of research on whether this scoring system can be applied to viral community acquired pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PSI in viral community acquired pneumonia. This retrospective cohort study included 1,434 adult patients (aged \ufffd18 years) who were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital during 2013-2015 because of community-acquired pneumonia. Viral infections were diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Patients diagnosed with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia were included in the control group (N = 1,173). The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate the risk of death. Respiratory viruses were detected in 261 (18.2%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Two types of respiratory viruses were detected in 7 cases. Of the 254 cases detected with only one virus, 62 were influenza A, 18 were influenza B, 65 were rhinovirus, 35 were respiratory syncytial virus, 25 were metapneumovirus, 20 were parainfluenza, 17 were coronavirus, 7 were bocavirus, and 5 were adenovirus. Mortality was not significantly different between patients with respiratory virus and those without respiratory virus; the 30day all-cause mortality rates were 20.3% and 22.4%, respectively (P = 0.45). Mortality rate increased with an increasing PSI score with or without respiratory viral infection. Pulmonary severity index was significantly associated with mortality adjusted for respiratory virus detection (hazard ratio = 1.024, 95% confidence interval = 1.020-1.028). Pneumonia severity index score is an important factor for assessing the prognosis of patients with communityacquired pneumonia, regardless of respiratory virus detection.",

Among CAP, outpatient treatment mortality ranges from 1% to 5%, but mortality rates in hospitalized patients are about 12% [2] . Based on these mortality rates, a tool for predicting the severity of PLOS CAP has been developed and is actively used in clinical practice [3, 4] . However, mortality of viral CAP has not been well validated by the pneumonia severity index (PSI). It is well known that the prognosis of community acquired pulmonary disease is influenced by the pathogen itself. However, co-morbidities of the patient and severity of infection at the time of diagnosis have been regarded as important factors in prognosis [3, 4] . In adults, viral CAP has a reported mortality from 1% to 39% [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The mortality rate of viral CAP was lower in patients with outpatient treatment, but increased with patient age [5, [8] [9] [10] . Unlike pediatric patients, many adult patients have multiple co-morbidities. In adult patients with viral CAP, coexisting disease, severity of infection at diagnosis, and age, rather than causative organism, have a significant impact on prognosis [3, 4] . However, the mortality of viral CAP has not been well considered with co-founders or co-morbidities in adults.",

We collected clinical data using the electronic medical record on general characteristics, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, lower respiratory complications, requirement of supplemental oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support, hospitalization duration, and all-cause mortality. Chest radiography was performed on all patients admitted to the hospital, and radiographic interpretation was performed for all cases by radiologists. Chest CT scan was also taken 1327 (92.9%) cases among all CAP. Additional laboratory investigations were performed based on the results of a routine blood test. Sputum samples were collected for bacterial culture preparation at admission and during hospitalization. Blood cultures were also performed when indicated. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) consisted four parts, demographics including age and sex, co-morbidity, physical examination, and laboratory findings [3] . PSI score was collected every admitted patient. We contacted patients or their families by phone to identify survival and clinical information if the patients were not followed up regularly.",

Due to viral endothelial cell damage and other mechanisms, there is increased concern for bacteremia after viral infection [27] [28] [29] . Therefore, it can be assumed that in the setting of respiratory virus infection, prognosis might be affected by the 2ndary bacterial infection. The rate of positive bacterial respiratory cultures for patients with virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP remained the same. In this study, 25% of sputum positive bacterial cultures occurred in patients with virus-detected CAP, and was similar or slightly higher than in previous studies.
