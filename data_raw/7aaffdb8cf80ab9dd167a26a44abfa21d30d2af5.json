Because no licensed MERS-CoV vaccines are currently available, preventive and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV, which binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is considered as a major target for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Here, we designed recombinant replication-deficient adenovirusbased vaccines expressing the N-terminal domain (rAd/NTD) and receptor-binding domain (rAd/RBD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit and full-length Spike protein (rAd/Spike). We found that immunization with candidate vaccines via intranasal route induced S1-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against MERS spike pseudotyped virus. Especially, rAd/ Spike induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and the strongest cytokine-induced T cell responses among the three candidate vaccines. To compare the immune responses induced by different administration routes, rAd/Spike was administered via intranasal, sublingual, or intramuscular route. All these administration routes exhibited neutralizing effects in the serum. MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing IgA antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were only induced by intranasal and sublingual administration but not by intramuscular administration. Intranasal administration with rAd/Spike also created resident memory CD8 T cells in the airway and lung parenchyma. Taken together, our results showed that both the humoral and cellular immune responses are highly induced by rAd/Spike administration, suggesting that rAd/Spike may confer protection against MERS-CoV infection.

The virus causes respiratory diseases such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may lead to pneumonia and acute renal failure in immunocompromised patients and the elderly [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . To date, 2,266 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases including 804 related deaths from 27 countries have been reported to World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Currently, such cases are increasingly being reported. MERS-CoV also has the potential for a widespread outbreak, as observed in 2015 in South Korea [8] . Currently, the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures has created an urgent need for effective vaccine the development against MERS-CoV infections [9, 10] . MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV) in the family Coronaviridae [11] [12] [13] . The MERS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [14, 15] . The S protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein on the virus surface, contains two functional subunits and mediates viral infection. The S1 subunit comprises N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) receptor on the host cell surface to initiate infection [16] [17] [18] . The S2 subunit with two heptad repeats (HR), HR1 and HR2, facilitates fusion between the virus and host cell membrane [19, 20] . The S glycoprotein is considered as a suitable vaccine candidate for eliciting neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry or neutralize viral infection [21] [22] [23] .",

These vaccine candidates induced humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses. However, a vaccination strategy focused on RBD alone has several issues that may not be optimal for generating neutralizing antibody responses [27] and can only induce partial protection against the MERS-CoV infection [29, 37] . Detailed structural analysis revealed that RBD-specific antibodies stimulate the emergence of viral escape mutation in this region; therefore, the generation of more diverse antibodies directed toward both RBD and outside the domain may be a better strategy for developing effective vaccines [27, 38] .",

Spike gene was codon-optimized and synthesized for mammalian cell expression (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). An optimal Kozak translation sequence was also included immediately upstream of ATG. This synthetic DNA was subcloned into a pShuttle-CMV vector through BglII/NotI double digestion and used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Subsequently, constructs expressing different MERS-CoV Spike protein fragments were designed. The coding sequence for RBD (residues 367-606) was amplified by PCR using the forward (5'-GAGCTAGCGAGGC CAAGCCCTCTGGC-3') and reverse primers (5'-GACTCGAGTTATCACTTGTCATCATCG TCCTTGTAGTCGTACTCCACGCAATTGCCCAG-3'), which contain two stop codons and a FLAG tag sequence. The coding sequence for NTD (residues 18-353) was amplified by PCR using the forward (5'-GA GCTAGCTACGTCGATGTGGGACC-3') and reverse primers (5'-GACTCGAGTTATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATGGGACTCATAGCTACAGTGCAG-3') which contain two stop codons and a six-histidine tag sequence. Finally, the PCR products of RBD and NTD gene were inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector through NheI/XhoI double digestion, respectively. The pShuttle-CMV plasmid was designed to include the start codon and the signal sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) upstream of the transgene sequence. Replication-defective adenoviruses (serotype 5) were generated by inserting foreign sequences via homologous recombination and subsequent purification of recombinant adenovirus (rAd), as described previously [40] . Briefly, the shuttle vector plasmid was electroporated into electrocompetent BJ5183 cells carrying the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral genomic DNA. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was isolated and linearized with PacI and subsequently transfected into HEK293 cells to generate rAd/Spike, rAd/RBD, and rAd/NTD viruses. Mock adenovirus (rAd/mock) was generated by the same method using the empty pShuttle-CMV vector. The recombinant viruses were amplified on HEK293 cells and purified by double-cesium chloride (CsCl 2 ) gradient ultracentrifugation. The expression and secretion of Spike and RBD proteins by rAd-infected HEK293 cells were verified via Western blot analysis by employing anti-MERS-CoV S1 protein rabbit polyclonal antibody [amino acids (aa) 1-725; 40069-T48; Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China] and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

Lung lymphocytes were stained with K d /S291 tetramer to quantify Spike-specific CD8 T cells. Previous studies have reported that CD8 T-cell responses to the MERS-CoV Spike protein were dominantly directed toward S291 (KYYSIIPHSI) epitope [46] . Other studies also screened epitopes in the RBD region to measure antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses, but the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells responding to other peptides seems to be either undetectable or very low [46, 47] . Therefore, we employed the S291 immunodominant epitope to evaluate the Spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses. Significant percentages of K d /S291 tetramer-positive CD8 T cells were detected in the lungs of rAd/NTD-or rAd/Spike-immune mice but not in the lungs of the mice in the rAd/mock or rAd/RBD group (Fig 2C and 2D) . S291-specific CD8 T cells were not observed in rAd/RBD-immunized mice, because RBD (aa residues from 367 to 606) does not contain the S291 epitope. To assess the levels of effector CD8 and CD4 T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3, lung lymphocytes were stimulated with S291 peptide or MERS S1 protein, respectively. IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells were also increased significantly in the rAd/Spike and rAd/NTD groups, and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells were increased significantly in the rAd/Spike group (S1 Fig). Subsequently, neutralizing activities of the immune sera and BALFs were evaluated using MERS-CoV Spike pseudotyped particles. Among the candidate vaccine groups, the rAd/ Spike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and BALFs, followed by mice in the rAd/NTD group (Fig 3A-3C) . However, rAd/RBD group exhibited no significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the rAd/mock control group. To further confirm the neutralizing activity of the rAd/Spike-induced antibody in an authentic MERS-CoV infection of human primary respiratory cells, MERS-CoV were preincubated with the immune sera from rAd/Spike and rAd/mock group before infection of NHNE cells. Subsequently the viral replication levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig 3D, pre-treatment of rAd/Spike-immune sera significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication while rAd/Mock sera did not. Taken together, these results demonstrate that immunization with rAd/Spike is the most efficient for eliciting both neutralizing antibody responses in serum and BALF and T-cell responses.",

As shown in Fig  4D, neutralization activity of immune sera was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with NTD, RBD, and S1 protein competitors. Especially, competition with the S1 protein inhibited neutralizing activity by~60%, while NTD and RBD competitors inhibited neutralization activity by~8% and~6%, respectively. In contrast, soluble S2 protein competitor did not have any effect on neutralization activity. These results demonstrate that rAd/Spike can induce neutralizing antibody responses targeting various regions of S1 including NTD and RBD.

Several vaccine candidates targeting RBD of the Spike protein have been investigated [22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 56] . However, it seems that the efficacy of the RBD-based vaccine candidates are limited by the confined breadth of antibody responses and subsequent emergence of escape mutants [27, 38, 57] . Indeed, it has been shown that several mutations in the RBD region can result in the generation of neutralization escape variants [38, [58] [59] [60] .

            "text": "In this study, we constructed adenovirus-based vaccine candidates that express NTD, RBD, and full-length Spike and compared immunogenicity and neutralizing activity induced by these candidates. Our results clearly showed that the rAd/Spike vaccine expressing full-length Spike protein is the best candidate in terms of immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy. It is likely that neutralizing epitopes of the Spike protein were located on non-RBD of the S1 subunit as well as RBD, based on the results of protein competitor experiments (Fig 4) . The use of full-length Spike as an immunogen in rAd/Spike vaccine might increase the breadth of the antibody responses which will help to reduce the risk of escape mutations [27, 57, 62] . However, it is not yet clear whether S2 region also contributes for inducing neutralizing antibodies by rAd/Spike vaccination. S2 subunit protein as a competitor did not reduce the neutralizing activities of the immune sera in the protein competitor experiments (Fig 4) , and this might be due to the inappropriate conformation of S2 subunit [27, 63] . Further studies are needed to determine whether the S2 subunit also contributes for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. It is noteworthy that the rAd/Spike vaccine induced systemic IgG, mucosal IgA, and T-cell responses together upon IN immunization. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, virus-specific CD8 T cells also play an important role in MERS-CoV clearance [46] . Indeed, several studies suggest that both virus-neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses are necessary for complete protection against MERS-CoV infection [29, 33, 35] . Therefore, the rAd/Spike vaccine expressing the full-length Spike protein rather than the RBD or NTD alone might be most potent one among our vaccine candidates.",

MERS-CoV infection occurs through respiratory tracts in humans [3, 64] . Accordingly, vaccination routes capable of inducing local mucosal immunity such as secretory IgA would be more potent in preventing MERS-CoV infection. In addition, IN immunization with rAd/Spike vaccine induced significantly higher numbers of specific T RM cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with IM-immunized mice (Fig 6) . It is likely that lung-resident T RM cells mediate effective protective immunity against respiratory infections [53, 65] . Thus, IN immunization of rAd/Spike eliciting systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and T RM responses together might be the most promising regimen compared to other immunization routes, and provide superior protection.",
