The impact of ILI and influenza on weekly outpatient visits was statistically significant (P < 0.05). We determined that 10.7% of outpatient visits were associated with ILI and 1.88% were associated with influenza. ILI also had a significant influence on the hospitalization rates (P < 0.05), but mainly in populations <25 years of age. No statistically significant effect of influenza on hospital admissions was found (P > 0.05). The impact of ILI on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most significant (P < 0.05), with",

The average annual incidence of influenza-associated hospitalizations is particularly high in children <5 years of age [12, 13] , greatly promoting the development of vaccination strategies. The findings of a population-based study indicated that the influenzaassociated disease burden on young children were mainly derived from outpatients, involved a high attendance rate, common complications, and immeasurable missed work/absenteeism, followed by influenza-associated hospitalizations, and death-related disease burden caused by influenza was comparatively low [14] . Studies to date have been primarily performed in developed temperate countries, as well as in a few high-income districts in tropical and subtropical countries [2, 4, 10] . However, basic data on influenza burden are lacking for most tropical and subtropical countries owing to lagging health-care facilities, monitoring, and information collection systems [15] .",

In the temperate regions of Europe and America, the influenza activity has a distinct seasonal pattern, with a winter epidemic peak and almost no activity during the other seasons. In subtropical areas such as Guangdong Province in south China, however, influenza activity occurs throughout the year, presenting a vague seasonality that makes it more difficult to use mathematical models that are frequently adopted in temperate areas [13, 16] . Studies on the influenza burden and the findings in temperate regions cannot be directly applied to (sub) tropical areas because of local features and population-specific attributes. In recent years, research on influenzarelated hospitalizations conducted in central China has shown that a seasonal influenza epidemic causes a substantial number of hospitalizations [17] , with an estimated 115-142 patients with severe acute respiratory infections per 100 000 hospitalizations attributed to influenza. However, the degree of impact of influenza in subtropical southern China has yet to be reported.",

Influenza monitoring in Zhuhai City during 2007-2009 showed year-round local pathogen activity; however, different subtypes of influenza virus showed inconsistent epidemic peaks, suggesting that the active period of transmission of a specific influenza virus should be considered in the timing of influenza vaccination to ensure the best preventive effect. Our study found an abrupt increase of influenza activity in 2009 compared with that in 2007 and 2008, and we believe that, in addition to the most obvious cause-the emergence of the new pandemic H1N1 strain-changes in surveillance practice (i.e., increased health-careseeking behavior for mild illnesses during the pandemic period and expansion of the surveillance range) are another reason for the substantial increase in influenza detection in 2009.",

During 2006-2008, 171 deaths were attributed to pneumonia in Zhuhai City, of which only 1 death was attributed to influenza. The mortality rate recorded in the death database is likely lower than the real situation for the following reasons: first, only a small number of patients with suspected influenza infections (especially adult patients) underwent virological testing; additionally, even in patients who were evaluated etiologically and ultimately died, the death certificates rarely listed influenza as the underlying cause of death owing to the doctors' selfprotection and other reasons [27] . The United States Centers for Disease Control and other researchers have stated that influenza mortality reflects a certain influence on patients who died of influenza but seriously underestimates the disease burden and that an appropriate statistical model is needed to estimate the full impact of influenza. The influenza-associated mortality estimated with the statistical model was 5-60 times that of the recorded influenza mortality rate in the United States [28] [29] [30] .

The 2009 WHO Influenza Burden Study Guide stated that the method was particularly suitable for the year-round assessment of influenza activity in tropical and subtropical regions. The results showed that ILI had a substantial effect on the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Four percent of outpatient visits were attributable to ILI, whereas 7% of hospitalized patients' diseases were associated with ILI and 17% of respiratory disease deaths were related to ILI. In addition to the influenza virus, many respiratory viruses (such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus) and bacteria can cause ILI [29, 31] , the epidemic seasons of which often overlap with those of influenza. Thus, the burden of ILI should include influenza and other related diseases involving respiratory pathogens and those with a much greater impact than the disease burden of influenza.",

There is a need to further strengthen the virological surveillance of influenza in the future by increasing ILI virological detection and emphasizing the randomness of the sampling to avoid artificially increasing the virus isolation rate by deliberately collecting typical cases for influenza virus separation. Such selective bias will result in influenza virological surveillance not accurately reflecting the strength of the influenza epidemic.",

This period is too short for a study on the influenza disease burden, which resulted in an inadequate test performance. Thus, further studies with more accumulated data are necessary. In this study, we only analyzed existing respiratory mortality data, and several similar studies found that influenza not only affects respiratory diseases but also induces or aggravates the risk for cardiovascular and other diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the data of all causes of deaths to enable a comprehensive assessment of the disease burden of influenza. Similarly, if detailed data of hospitalization cases (including patient age and sex, disease etiology, and other information) can be obtained, the disease burden of influenza can be analyzed and high-risk populations can be further identified.
