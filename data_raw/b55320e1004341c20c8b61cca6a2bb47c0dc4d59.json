Once validated, the proposed biomarkers can be involved in achieving an earlier diagnosis, differentiating between disease types with greater accuracy, and assessing response to treatment.

Unfortunately, the most widely used techniques for detection of biomarkers OPEN ACCESS such as mass spectrometry [2] , 2-D western blotting [3] , 2-D gel electrophoresis [4] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [5, 6] are not suitable for the analysis of large numbers of samples or the multiplexed detection of many targets within an individual sample.

The ability to routinely measure protein targets at femtomolar concentrations and lower would be extremely valuable for early disease diagnosis [15, 16] .

The AMCA slides are obtained by reaction of the amine modified slide glass with the AMCA to generate a monolayer of AMCA on the chip surface. The 9G probes are immobilized by multiple interactions of the nine consecutive guanines on the AMCA monolayer.

After loading the hybridization mixture on the 9G DNAChip surface, the target DNA T2 in the biomolecular complex, guide the biomolecular complex to the specific site and hybridize with the surface-bound complementary oligonucleotide Probe2 for the detection (for the detailed preparation of the hybridization mixture please see the Supplementary Information Table S2 ). After washing and drying, the 9G DNAChips were scanned and analyzed. The obtained results are presented in Figure 1 . As shown in Figure 1A , the biomolecular complex (Cy5-CRPAB-CRPAg-CRPAb-T2) of CRPAg with Cy5-CRPAB and CRPAb-T2 is site-specifically guided and hybridized to the complementary Probe2 on the chip surface. In a similar way, the target probe Cy5-T1 is hybridized to the complementary Probe11 on the chip surface, indicating the hybridization control. Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that the DAGON method allows the detection of antigens with a concentration as low as 400 fg/mL. However, Figure 1 also depicts the effect of the concentration of the DNA labeled capture antibody (CRPAb-T2) (see the Supplementary Information Figure S1 ) on the detection of the biomarker CRPAg. Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that the decrease in the concentration of the capture antibody CRPAb-T2 increases the detection limit. The fluorescence intensities of the biomolecular complexes formed by the use of 8 \u00b5g/mL-1 \u00b5g/mL and 65 ng/mL of CRPAb-T2 and 400 fg/mL of CRPAg and hybridized with the immobilized probe on the chip surface, are 80-90 times lower than those with the use of 125 ng/mL-250 ng/mL of CRPAb-T2 and 400 fg/mL of CRPAg (Figure 1 , see the Supplementary Information Figure S1 ). The hybridization pattern of the biomolecular complexes formed by using different concentrations of the capture antibody CRPAb-T2 suggests that 250 ng/mL is the optimum concentration for the efficient detection of 400 fg/mL of the biomarker CRPAg. One of the possible reasons behind this hybridization pattern is that use of hybridization mixture with the higher concentration of the CRPAb-T2 leads to a much higher amount of the free CRPAb-T2 than the CRPAb-T2 in the biomolecular complex Cy5-CRPAB-CRPAg-CRPAb-T2. Therefore the free CRPAb-T2 competes with the CRPAb-T2 in the biomolecular complex Cy5-CRPAB-CRPAg-CRPAb-T2 to hybridize with the immobilized Probe2, which leads to the lower fluorescence intensities and significantly hampers the limit of detection of the biomarker CRPAg.",

Therefore, to find the optimum concentration of the Cy5 labeled secondary antibody (Cy5-CRPAB), the hybridization mixtures were prepared by mixing CRPAb-T2 with a concentration of 250 ng/mL and Cy5-CRPAB with concentrations ranging from 4 \u00b5g/mL to 500 ng/mL in the hybridization solution. On addition of CRPAg (4 ng/mL-400 fg/mL) to the mixture of the Cy5-CRPAB, CRPAb-T2, they together form a Cy5-CRPAB-CRPAg-CRPAb-T2 complex in the solution. The 50 \u03bcL of the hybridization mixture was loaded in the hybridization chambers formed by covering the 9G DNAChips with Secure-Seal\u2122, and then allowed to hybridize for 60 min at 25 \u00b0C (for the detailed preparation of the hybridization mixture please see the Supplementary Information Table S3 ).

Figure 2 also clearly demonstrates that the decrease in the concentration of the Cy5-CRPAB from 4 \u00b5g/mL to 1 \u00b5g/mL decreases the fluorescence intensity for the detection of the CRPAg from 4 ng/mL to 400 fg/mL. The fluorescence intensities of the biomolecular complexes formed by the use of 4 \u00b5g/mL-1 \u00b5g/mL of Cy5-CRPAB and 400 fg/mL of CRPAg upon hybridization with the immobilized probe on the chip surface are almost similar. However, these fluorescence intensities are 4-5 times higher than the biomolecular complexes formed by the use 500 ng/mL of Cy5-CRPAB and 400 fg/mL of CRPAg upon hybridization with the immobilized probe on the chip surface. The hybridization pattern of the biomolecular complexes formed by using different concentration of the Cy5 labeled secondary antibody (Cy5-CRPAB) suggests that a concentration of 4 \u00b5g/mL-1 \u00b5g/mL gives efficient detection for 400 fg/mL of the biomarker CRPAg. However, as the use of 4 \u00b5g/mL-1 \u00b5g/mL of Cy5-CRPAB showed similar results we considered 1 \u00b5g/mL of the Cy5-CRPAB as an optimum concentration for the detection of the biomarker CRPAg.",

However, fluorescence intensity with 240 min hybridization is only twice that of the fluorescence intensity with 120 min hybridization.

Although ELISA is a long standing standard for quantitative analysis of CRP, it suffers from a relatively low throughput because of its lack of multiplexing ability and high reagent and sample consumption [27] . The accuracies of traditional ELISAs vary considerably when the sample concentrations are lower than 1 ng/mL. High-sensitivity ELISAs (hs-ELISAs) improve the detection sensitivity to as low as 0.014 \u00b5g/mL by signal amplification [28] . Protein microarrays obtained by direct immobilization of capture antibodies were developed in order to overcome the limitations of the conventional ELISA based method. However, these microarrays must have relatively large sample volumes and additional capture materials. Additionally, these microarrays have a high limit of detection (LOD) and a long incubation time [29] . DNA-Directed Immobilization (DDI) was employed to improve the stability of proteins by immobilizing them on the surface shortly before the detection of antigens [30] . In such stepwise methods, first the proteins are immobilized on the surface and in the second step they are allowed to react with the target proteins. The disadvantage of this method is that once the proteins are immobilized on the surface they still have a chance to lose their activity over a period of time [31] . Thus, methods like DDI improve the stability of proteins, but the lengthy process limits the sensitivity of the method to 100 pg/mL [15] .",

The 9G DNAChip was obtained by allowing the formation of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) on the chip surface. According to the proposed method, biomarker with a range of concentrations of 4 pg/mL to 40 fg/mL can be easily differentiated. Moreover, it is the first time that biomarker with a concentration as low as 40 fg/mL has been detected in a mixture of proteins without the use of any signal amplification technique. This represents an improvement of 1000 times in sensitivity, compared to previously reported methods. The proposed method can be applied for the efficient detection of multiple biomarkers for diagnostic applications. The ability to perform rapid, multiplexed protein biomarker analyses in complex biological fluids will undoubtedly lead to new opportunities for the understanding and treatment of disease. Hence, the presented method is under investigation for the detection of biomarkers in clinical samples.",
