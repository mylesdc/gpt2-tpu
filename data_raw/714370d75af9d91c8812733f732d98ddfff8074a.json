            "text": "The West African Ebola virus outbreak underlined the importance of delivering mass diagnostic capability outside the clinical or primary care setting in effectively containing public health emergencies caused by infectious disease. Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 loglinear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resourcelimited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats. ; Tel: +44(0) 191 215 6623 \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

            "text": "The 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak resulted in over 28 500 con\ue103rmed cases across three continents with an overall mortality rate of 39.5% (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ releases/2016/ebola-zero-liberia/en/). Unlike previous outbreaks, lack of preparedness in West Africa, local customs that facilitated transmission, and the generally poor healthcare infrastructure were key to the unprecedented size of the outbreak. An international emergency response was therefore necessary to arrest what rapidly became a global health and security threat. Thus, at the peak of transmission in August 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC; http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/ 2014/ebola-20140808/en/). It quickly became clear that success in containing the outbreak would pivot on three actions: (1) reliable diagnosis of suspected/probable cases i.e. symptomatic individuals; (2) quick isolation of patients con\ue103rmed as infected with EBOV, and; (3) effective contact tracing. 1 Unfortunately, symptomatic, suspected cases were difficult to differentially diagnose against other causative agents of hemorrhagic fever, as symptoms were generally non-speci\ue103c and common to other endemic, high incidence infections such as malaria, yellow fever, and Lassa fever. Furthermore, epidemiological information, where available, only marginally contributed to patient triage by increasing EBOV disease risk potential from 'suspected' to 'probable'. Thus, it became essential to obtain explicit, clinical diagnostic grade evidence of active EBOV infection as quickly as possible a\ue09der patient presentation. Nucleic acid ampli\ue103cation testing (NAAT) using thermal cycling, \ue104uorescent probes and real time, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was quickly recognized as the most reliable clinical diagnostic solution for symptomatic EBOV patients. 2 Thus, studies during previous outbreaks [3] [4] [5] and data emerging from West Africa 4 reaffirmed that patients would present to triage only when symptoms became intense, corresponding to high viraemia levels ranging 10 5 -10 10 genome equivalents per ml (GE per ml) of whole blood.",

Unlike most other territories, in the USA the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) presently regulates stringently both IVD thermal cycler instruments and associated IVD assay kits through extensive clinical trials before issuing marketing authorization. Furthermore, diagnostic services based on NAAT are provided only through FDA-regulated laboratories; the services also cover infectious disease agent diagnostics, including a multitude of RNA viruses. 6 This regulatory framework applies whether the diagnostic test is available as an independently marketed IVD kit or an assay developed in-house in the regulated laboratory using regulated reagents. Such measures enhance diagnostic service reliability, a requirement important in the context of highly infectious disease such as hazard group 3 and 4 pathogens.",

            "text": "Implementation of NAAT diagnostics for EBOV disease was spearheaded by the August 2014 FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the EZ1 Taqman\u00ae assay which uses FAMlabelled \ue104uorescent probes for RT-qPCR undertaken on one of several FDA-approved thermal cyclers (http://www.fda. gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/ UCM418799.pdf). This molecular test involves the quantitative detection of two RNA substrates: the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) 7 gene encoded in the negative RNA genome of EBOV, and the human ribonuclease P (RP) transcript which is found at high levels in human bio\ue104uid samples, as an endogenous/process control. 8 To date, this so-called Trombley assay 7 remains the gold standard of diagnostic care 7, 9, 10 used by public health agencies worldwide and is reported to be the most sensitive and speci\ue103c for semi-quantitative EBOV diagnosis in viraemic, i.e. symptomatic patients. 10 Thus, the Trombley assay features a 0.0001 plaque forming unit per reaction (PFU per reaction) lower limit of detection (LLOD), across a 5 log-linear dynamic range (LDR), 7, 9 and analytical speci\ue103city against human RNA, and 75 other pathogens (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/UCM408334.pdf). Of note, the quali\ue103cation and performance data of this assay do not pertain to the reaction substrate, the EBOV RNA genome, but rather the amount of live virus in the sample. This relates to the use of infectious virus quanti\ue103cation methods in classical virology (PFU quanti\ue103cation assays), 11 which are medically valuable in informing the risk of infection/transmission, rather than the biochemically relevant assay substrate concentration reported by NAAT. Yet studies with in vitro produced virus 9, 12 and macaque infection models 13 indicate the viral genomes might be 10-fold 12 to 10 000-fold 9 higher than infectious virions in a given sample. This has been evidenced across many hazard group 3 and 4 viruses, and has been associated to the extent of virus passage in vitro. 13 Clinical data remains limited given the preference for immediate virus inactivation for health and safety reasons.",

Thus, venous blood is the biological sample of choice, but the large volumes needed (3.5 ml) increase the risk of uncontrolled bleeding for patients exhibiting hemorrhagic symptoms. The samples also present a risk of infection to the healthcare staff collecting them and the diagnostic laboratory personnel analyzing them, making extensive safety training essential in reducing transmission. Notwithstanding safety concerns, the Trombley assay procedure further necessitates considerable technical expertise involving multiple manual steps operating expensive laboratory infrastructure and mains-powered instrumentation, using expensive consumables stored constantly at 4 C. Appropriately equipped facilities were scant in West Africa and the technology was not suited to laboratory-free \ue103eld deployment in rural regions where need was at its highest. 2 In addition, at $US$100, the cost per patient 14 exceeded by up to tenfold the annual, per capita healthcare expenditure in the region. 15 Moreover, the time-to-results, at best 5-8 hours from sample receipt, restricted throughput capacity and presented additional infection risks to EBOV-free patients awaiting results whilst in triage. Overall, at the peak of transmission, assay complexity, cost, and lack of speed to molecular diagnosis hampered the efforts to stave off transmission.",

Thus, the ideal diagnostic test should be affordable, sensitive, speci\ue103c, user-friendly, robust, rapid, equipment-free and deliverable to those in needi.e. usable in the \ue103eld with minimal requirements for additional resources. Ideally, this would also involve minimal bio\ue104uid volumes, such as microliter drops of blood analysed in situ by digital venipuncture, not dissimilar to over-the-counter, point-of-need glucometers. To date, the most clinically advanced, close-to-patient NAAT IVDs still require powered instrumentation, a fully equipped laboratory setting (\ue103xed or mobile), training associated to multiple handling steps starting with 3.5 ml of venous blood, and consumables still far too costly for the countries most affected by such tropical disease. 2, 10, 17 Here, we report our efforts to address the need for quantitative, rapid and reliable, molecular diagnosis of EBOV disease in symptomatic patients arriving at triage, under the 12 month Emergency Call Research for Health in Humanitarian Crisis (r2hc) program of the Enhancing Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA) organization. Taking into account reports that quantitative PCR (qPCR) is possible in reactions containing blood, 18, 19 we present evidence that this extends to RT-qPCR retaining quantitative diagnostic value without the need for substantial formulation/enzyme modi\ue103cations, provided far-red dyes are used to overcome the \ue104uorogenic inhibition effect of blood and the minimal impact on sensitivity remains clinically acceptable. We further evaluate the utility of controlled freezing and thawing cycles in disrupting virion structures to release viral genomes directly in blood samples as an energy and engineering-efficient means of eliminating manual or automated RNA extraction and puri\ue103cation. We further present the development of an instrument and computational approach compatible with parallel detection of multiple far-red dyes, engineered for \ue103eld deployment at the point of need, in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner, and with minimal end-user training requirements. Finally, we determine the performance of this approach in detecting and quantifying EBOV against the gold standard, laboratory-based Trombley assay, within the context of screening symptomatic patients in a triage setting.",

Moreover, to overcome limited biosafety level 4 (BSL4) facility and staff availability due to increased screening services demand, we used surrogate EBOV templates. We reasoned against chemically synthesized RNA as a template because blood nucleases rapidly degrade such biomaterials at ambient temperatures, 20 which could prove problematic with minimal assay formulations. On the other hand, de novo construction of in vitro produced, non-infectious, and/or replication-de\ue103cient EBOV virions, 21 an approach common for many well-studied species of mammalian viruses, was actively discouraged outside high containment for reasons of health, safety, and biosecurity. We thus elected to use commercially available recombinant MS2 coliphage as our primary surrogate template (AR14), despite the robustness of this virion compared to the easily fragmentable nature of \ue103lovirus particles, 22 and pseudotyped lentivirus (PV) based on HIV manufactured in-house as a fallback template (see ESI, Fig. S1 \u2020). 23 To benchmark Trombley assay performance with these standards, we performed the plate-based EZ1 kit standard operating procedure (SOP) on an ABI7500 real time thermal cycler. 7 We thus used healthy volunteer blood freshly collected by super\ue103cial venipuncture, spiked with AR14 to a \ue103nal concentration of 1.67 \u00c2 10 11 GE per ml of blood. Viral RNA was then extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), puri\ue103ed extracts were serially diluted with nuclease-free water and 5 ml volumes were assayed in triplicate. The results demonstrated independent ampli\ue103cation efficiencies for the GP and NP assays (98.0% and 102%, respectively) despite the use of the same template, resulting in distinct curve \ue103ts as determined by Akaike's informative criteria test (Fig. 1) . The high concentration of AR14, however, allowed us to demonstrate a linear dynamic range (LDR) for both assays 3 logs higher than that reported previously. 7 Moreover, the 6.67 genome equivalent per reaction (GE per reaction) lower limit of detection (LLOD) and low variability between technical replicates, as demonstrated through 95% con\ue103dence bands across the dilution series (% CV < 2.09% for GP and < 3.41% for NP), set performance standards for forward work. Furthermore, a\ue09der generating PV constructs containing the Trombley assay target sequences corresponding to the 1976 EBOV Yambuka-Ecran reference genome (PV76) and the 2014 EBOV Guinea Makona reference genome (PV14), we con\ue103rmed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms identi\ue103ed within the West African outbreak isolate 24 had limited impact on diagnostic assay reliability (see ESI, Fig. S1 , Tables S1 and S2 \u2020).",

Notably, this work involved blood and plasma treated with anticoagulants which are known PCR inhibitors, and samples were freeze-thawed up to \ue103ve times. Use of green dye-labelled Taqman\u00ae probes (CAL Fluor 540 nm) was later shown by the same group to require a complex PCR enhancer cocktail to achieve detection of as little as 7 genome equivalents per microliter (GE per ml) of DNA template with their OmniTaq polymerase in the presence of blood. Although the authors demonstrated that the cocktail could be useful for other polymerases in end-point PCR assays, they did not discuss its' use in RT-qPCR. Encouraged by these reports, and working in parallel to constructing the PV standards, we investigated whether the blood compatibility of PCR could be extended to RNA templates and RT-PCR using similar, well-characterized assays. 6, 27 However, in line with our projected application of analyzing patient blood immediately upon collection, we dispensed with anticoagulants and blood storage altogether. Instead, we spiked fresh human blood directly into reactions by obtaining it through digital venipuncture ad hoc. We thus assembled onestep RT-qPCR reactions with a commercially available Taq polymerase (GoTaq\u00ae G2 Flex; Promega, Inc) or the bloodtolerant OmniTaq 2 (DNA Polymerase Technology, Inc.), using the manufacturer's mastermix, respectively, and 5 U per reaction of GoScript\u00ae Moloney Murine Leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Importantly, although these mastermix formulations remained proprietary, both suppliers con\ue103rmed that neither formulation featured additives to overcome PCR inhibitors. Working on wet ice, these reactions were spiked with 4 \u00c2 10 8 copies of Escherichia coli MS2 phage RNA, a FAM-labelled Taqman\u00ae probe (518 nm emission peak), and increasing concentrations of fresh blood (Fig. 2 ). To our surprise, our results indicated that RT-PCR successfully proceeded in the presence of blood with no obvious differences between the hot-start, wild type Taq polymerase (Fig. 2a) and the blood-adapted OmniTaq mutant (Fig. 2b) . However, in both cases, blood inhibited the \ue104uorogenic signal of the probe in a concentration-dependent manner.",

To examine this hypothesis, the emission spectra of a gamut of commercially available, far-red nucleic acid stains (SYTO\u00ae family) and \ue104uorescent dyes (CAL635, Quasar 670, Quasar 705) was assessed in the presence or absence of fresh human blood (Fig. 2c) .

In these studies, use of a laser diode source provided power output advantages that were paralleled by several reduced engineering problems, such as optical \ue103ber coupling and structural stability, and dispensation of wavelength \ue103ltering requirements because lasers are a discrete wavelength light source. Thus, use of this source provided more excitation power to the vessel and, with temperature stabilization, a more stable power and wavelength that any of the power LEDs tested. and (b, d) nucleoprotein (NP) assays were subjected to one-step qRT-PCR on an ABI7500 using the EZ1 SOP.

In our whole blood assay format, however, SYTO-17 and SYTO-61 showed comparable levels of peak signal loss, with SYTO-60, -62, and -63 exhibiting a substantial increase in peak signal levels, followed by SYTO-59 and SYTO-64 (<20% peak signal increase). These reports and our results therefore indicate SYTO-59, and -64 might have direct utility in substituting SYBR Green I on whole blood qPCR and RT-qPCR, especially since SYTO-64 has been previously demonstrated to have no impact on PCR efficiency. 33 In stark contrast to the nucleic acid stains, the probecompatible Quasar 670, Quasar 705 and CAL635 dyes consistently exhibited some 30-50% signal inhibition (Fig. 2c) . However, all three allowed for 15.2 dB, 9.98 dB and 15.9 dB signal-to-noise ratios at their corresponding emission peaks ( Fig. S3A -C \u2020), respectively, relative to background blood emission spectra (Fig. S3L \u2020) .

In these cases, existing assays can be readily multiplexed if no competitive PCR inhibition is experimentally evidenced, and \ue104uorophores with spectrally distinct emission peaks are used. 41 From an instrument perspective, probe multiplexing requires either multiple detectors, each equipped with its own detection range \ue103lter, or a single detector mounted with a moving \ue103lter wheel equipped with the relevant wavelength \ue103lters. Both solutions, however, bear manufacturing cost and instrument reliability implications due to the requirement for multiple and/or moving parts, which are ill-suited to \ue103eld deployment in resource-limited countries.

Protein denaturation at high temperatures can also disrupt ribonucleoprotein complexes, thereby releasing nucleic acids for analytical assays. Used together, it has been proposed that the two processes might enable access to bacterial DNA templates for real time PCR in a single chamber system without the need for any biological sample preprocessing (WO/2011/157989).

This is a \ue104uid cooled heatsink whereby the \ue104uid, in this case at 35 C, is held at a temperature intermediate of the PCR extension temperature and the freezing point (WO2010010361) to enable rapid \u00c020 C cooling. This relies on high levels of thermal isolation of the heatsink from the sample such that the DT of the Peltier can be relied upon to drive the reaction \ue104uid to in excess of 50 C below that of the HRM and hence make possible freezing in higher temperature environments. In these tests, we also used the Trombley+ assay and 10 5 GE of our custom-manufactured AR14 EBOV Armored RNA\u00ae MS2 coliphage construct. Finally, given our results on RT-PCR enzyme tolerance for blood, we performed this test with the ABI Fast virus master mix, which is used in the EZ1 diagnostic assay. With the device achieving overall sample-to-answer in 70 minutes ahead of any additional RT-PCR thermal cycling timing optimization beyond the standard Taqman\u00ae cycling timings used in the EZ1 assay, these results reproduced the outcome of the manual study, identifying 8-10 freeze-thaw cycles as the optimal viral particle disruption range (Fig. 5a, S7A and B \u2020) .

Each assay station accepts a single, custom fabricated, disposable puck sealed with a custom optical lid designed for easy handling (d). The resulting 20 kg, QuRapID instrument is a tabletop-sized device powered by a car alternator, car battery or mains electricity featuring eight independently operated assay stations, with software designed for simple (video online) end-user interaction in full personal protective equipment, suited for field deployment in a ruggedized case and medium throughput testing in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner (e).",

Thus, with the blood-free reactions returning a Ct of 15, an <128\u00c2 loss of signal (Ct of 22) was observed at low blood concentrations; however, the trend was reversed to peak at 8% v/v blood with only a 4\u00c2 signal loss (i.e. Ct 17). Crucially, this small signal loss only affected the assay lower limit of quanti\ue103cation (LLOQ; Fig. 5c ), as 66, and 6 GE of AR14 were successfully discriminated from a no template, 8% v/v blood-containing reaction, but the two positive samples were indistinguishable between them. These results indicated that, although quanti\ue103cation at the lower end of the Trombley+ assay could be compromised in the presence of blood, detection could still be reliably achieved. On the basis of the 1.4 \u00c2 10 4 PFU per ml whole blood detection limit for the laboratory-based Trombley assay, 9 we reasoned that use of 5 microliters of whole blood in our method, i.e. 70 PFUs per reaction in a volume compatible with digital venipuncture, would match the performance of the laboratory method whilst remaining above the Fig. 5 Optimised, controlled freeze-thawing of RNA viruses in probe-based qRT-PCR containing blood or serum. (a) Optimal freeze-thaw extraction of RNA from viruses within qRT-PCR master mixes in the same reaction vessel is achieved with 8-10 freeze-thaw cycles as determined through threshold cycle (Ct) detection of template amplification using the Trombley+ GP assay against 10 5 GE per reaction of AR14 templates. No blood was used in these reactions. (b) Increasing amounts of blood spiked into reactions containing 6.6 \u00c2 10 8 GE per reaction AR14 subjected to 10 automated freeze-thaw cycles results in a 2 Ct drop in GP Trombley+ assay performance (4\u00c2) against reactions containing no blood. The Ct call in the absence of blood in the reaction (0% v/v final blood concentration) is used as an optimal performance reference. (c) Amplification discrimination for the Trombley+ assay between no template control (NTC) reactions, and reactions containing 66 GE of AR14. Reactions were spiked with 5 microliters of human blood (8% v/v final blood concentration in the reaction) and viral genomes were extracted in the qRT-PCR blood-containing mix using 8 freeze-thaw cycles. (d) Ten-fold serial dilutions in tissue culture media of tissue cultured derived, 700 PFU per ml Ebola virus were tested in three independent reactions using the Trombley+ GP assay. Fetal bovine serum was spiked into these reactions as a fresh patient sample matrix surrogate, to an 8% v/v final concentration. (e) Calibration of Ebola virus sample PFUs against GE content, as independently determined on the QuRapID under BSL4 testing using AR14 pre-qualification runs, reveals strong linear concordance between two Ebola virus strains diluted in FBS and the ArmoredRNA surrogate template (99.96% probability of single curve fit, Akaike's Informative Criteria test; individual replicates and 95% confidence bands shown). limit of quanti\ue103cation exhibited experimentally. Thus, the total reaction volume for our method was \ue103nalized at 62.5 ml containing a 5 ml blood sample (8% v/v). To determine whether accurate sampling at this scale could take in the place in the \ue103eld we evaluated a range of IVD-grade, graduated plastic capillary samplers to observe a <3% standard deviation in 5 ml collection with the Pasteur pipette-like MicroSafe\u00ae capillaries (n \u00bc 20).

Previous reports indicated stored blood samples impacted efficient completion of PCR, 18,25 which motivated us to seek samples stored in the absence of additives known to impact PCR. However, anecdotal evidence indicated substantial operator variability in sampling and storage procedures throughout the West African outbreak. Therefore, to minimize the impact of such variability inherent to stored samples vs. what should be a minimal, direct sample analysis process, we elected to proceed with BSL4 laboratory testing with a range of live, culture-derived Filoviruses. On the other hand, collection of fresh human blood by digital venipuncture was prohibited in BSL4 for health and safety reasons. As a result, fetal bovine serum (FBS) obtained without the use of anticoagulants or preservatives was used as a surrogate biological matrix to human blood. In doing so, we also acknowledged that direct volume substitution of blood with serum would double the \ue103nal concentration of serum components in our reactions, doubling in parallel their PCR inhibitory effects.",

A\ue09der undertaking assay transfer to BSL4 and pre-quali\ue103cation with our AR14 standards ( Fig. 5d and S7E \u2020) , infectious, culture-propagated Filoviruses were serially diluted and tested at each resulting concentration on the QuRapID. Alternatively, the serially diluted viruses were extracted, puri\ue103ed and assayed according to the EZ1 assay SOP. The results indicated the Trombley+/QuRapID system could detect as little as a 1.4 \u00c2 10 3 PFU per ml whole bloodequivalent of live EBOV Yambuka Ecran (Fig. 5d and S7F \u2020) , with a LLOQ of 1.4 \u00c2 10 4 PFU per ml whole blood-equivalent.

            "text": "The socioeconomic value of molecular diagnostics in containing highly infectious disease has been convincingly demonstrated in the West and concurrent Central/East African EBOV outbreaks, 51 and the South Korean Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak. 52 Furthermore, historical data causally link international travel and mass attendance events with pandemic transmission. 53 Therefore the capacity to deploy appropriate, reliable and cost-effective diagnostic capability is an international public health requirement. Yet, to date, there exists no true point of need solution suitable for mass screening that can support effective containment at international ports of entry or outbreak triage centers etc., with minimal economic burden, transportation and international trade disruption. Indeed, we expect no such single system to prove of universal utility given transmission, symptomatology and carrier status may differ vastly depending on the biology of each pathogen and thus be best detectable through use of distinct analytical procedures. Rather, a \ue104exible approach needs to be adopted, centered on responding rapidly, implementing appropriate technologies and proportionate procedures relevant to key factors to patient presentation and disease dissemination. Thus, whilst many highly infectious viral diseases may disseminate through asymptomatic carriers, EBOV transmission requires viraemia whose levels correlate with symptom intensity and indeed survival potential. 9,10,54,55 As a result, many efforts have been made to detect pre-symptomatic levels of EBOV infection, 56 with several anecdotal reports of various NAATs detecting pre-symptomatic individuals in the course of their evaluation during the West African outbreak. At present, however, the most reliable evidence thereto pertains to an 8-plex host microRNA biomarker signature detectable by NAAT in blood plasma. 57 However, this has only a 50% pre-symptomatic, and a relatively low 86% infection status classi\ue103cation potential. Therefore, reliable containment of future EBOV outbreaks will pivot on effective detection and screening of symptomatic individuals. Crucially, such EBOV positive patients typically present with viraemia levels well in excess of 10 5 GE per ml of whole blood, i.e. some 2-4 orders of magnitude above of the LLOD of the Trombley and other RT-qPCR assays, as demonstrated in multiple studies during the West African 4,55,58,59 as well as historical outbreaks. [3] [4] [5] 60 Of the diagnostic solutions proposed for EBOV and other infectious diseases, the most advanced, minimal end-user input technologies include antibody lateral \ue104ow tests 61 and semiautomated NAATs. 10, 17 The latter, however, remain the most reliable and robust methods for diagnosing EBOV in viraemic patients, 9, 10, 54 with antibody systems suited to exclusion screening in cadavers or patients exhibiting intense symptoms. 62 Yet both NAATs used for diagnostic purposes in West Africa 7,63 required mobile laboratory deployments. 2 Thus, the benchtop BioM\u00e9rieux BioFire\u00ae FilmArray and Cepheid Gen-eXpert\u00ae NAATs received WHO and/or FDA EUA during the West African outbreak. Both instruments require basic laboratory infrastructure, are semi-quantitative, multiplexing-compatible and up to eight times faster than the manual Trombley method. Whilst BioFire\u00ae offers FDA-approved, differential diagnosis at a cost of $US$150 per test, GeneXpert\u00ae assays for single agents at $US$20 and offers medium throughput through scalable devices. In both cases, however, sample processing still requires \ue104exible-\ue103lm isolator containment, technical expertise pertaining to the manual steps involved, and know-how related to data interpretation. Nonetheless, together, these solutions allow for index case causal agent identi\ue103cation and provide some capacity for screening, albeit still in a laboratory setting and at considerable cost largely due to micro\ue104uidics and/or pumps which mechanise as many manual procedures as possible. Thus, overall, BioFire\u00ae tests are comparably priced to laboratory-based Trombley assays, whereas the GeneXpert\u00ae EBOV test remains up to twice more expensive than the annual per capita healthcare spend in West Africa, despite charitable development funding and ex-works pricing as negotiated by FIND Diagnostics on behalf of the WHO, substantially reimbursed by the Gates Foundation. Importantly, the recently announced, portable GeneXpert\u00ae Omni offers single sample analysis capacity albeit with no improvement in sample-to-data turnaround (2 hours), questioning its mass screening utility. Moreover, both systems are 'closed access', meaning public health authorities cannot independently respond to emerging threats by rapidly transitioning their in-house developed assays to such disseminated use platforms: tellingly, the Trombley assay received FDA EUA days a\ue09der the WHO PHEIC declaration, whereas the Cepheid platform required several months of additional development. Elsewhere, emerging alternative NAAT solutions focus on the energy efficiency of isothermal ampli\ue103cation technologies 64 as well as the agnostic, de novo analytical power of memory sticksized sequencing systems. 65, 66 Whilst many of these have been successfully evaluated in resource-limited settings, 64,65 these solutions still require extensive and costly laboratory infrastructure for sample pre-processing 64-66 even onto genome extraction, 65, 66 are non-quantitative, 64 closed access, 64, 66 or require high bandwidth data transfer/computational power access 65, 66 to realize their potential.",

            "text": "In this work, we have demonstrated that controlled, low temperature freeze-thawing of viruses as structurally diverse as MS2 coliphage (Armored RNA\u00ae) and EBOV can release virion genomes within a complex bio\ue104uid matrix such as serum or fresh blood. Furthermore, we have evidenced that simple substitution of commonly used green DNA stains and probe dyes with red/far red \ue104uorophores spectrally compatible with blood eliminates \ue104uorogenic inhibition in RT-qPCR. Unlike previous reports involving various formats of stabilized blood, 18, 19, 25 in our hands, use of freshly obtained blood, e.g. by digital venipuncture, did not appear to extensively or entirely inhibit PCR. More importantly, combination of controlled freeze/thawing with far red \ue104uorophores and simple RT-qPCR enzyme formulations was found to be reliable enough to adequately and co-linearly detect speci\ue103c genetic targets across at least two classes of viruses, assayed on separate days. To our knowledge this is the \ue103rst use of pre-calibration standards for RT-qPCR-mediated sample quanti\ue103cation, directly in whole blood, across a wide dynamic range, with minimal impact on sensitivity and no impact on diagnostic speci\ue103city. Thus, the 1.4 \u00c2 10 4 PFU per ml of whole blood equivalent detection limit for the Trombley+ assay on the QuRapID platform is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the detection limit of the gold standard laboratory-based Trombley/ABI7500 test. At \ue103rst glance this might appear too great a difference between a novel and a gold standard platform. However, the Trombley+/ QuRapID LLOD is comparable to the independently reported LLOQ of the Trombley/ABI7500 gold standard at 1.2 \u00c2 10 4 PFU per ml. 9 Nonetheless, this metric does not relate to viral genomes, the analyte detected by both assays. Rather, performance quali\ue103cation is expressed relative to the concentration of viable, infectious viral particles, which are impossible to quantify by RT-qPCR. However, both our data and the latest independent Trombley assay performance report, 9 present GE/ PFU ratios: this makes direct comparisons acceptable across the studies, laboratories and platforms. Thus, in the context of the 1 \u00c2 10 5 GE per ml or greater viraemia levels exhibited by symptomatic EBOV patients, 3-5,55,58-60 our results evidence clinical utility for our proposed approach to meet demand during future EBOV outbreaks, subject to completion of the necessary EUA quali\ue103cation studies. Moreover, as EBOV caches in the cerebrospinal \ue104uid of survivors and may lead to meningoenchephalitis, 67 we have also brie\ue104y examined whether our method is compatible with this bio\ue104uid. Thus, we observed no effect from blood contamination on Trombley+/QuRapID Ct calls a\ue09der spiking AR14 at 1 \u00c2 10 8 GE into reactions containing 10% v/v human cerebrospinal \ue104uid (Fig. S9 \u2020) . The approach may therefore offer utility beyond symptomatic EBOV diagnosis, not only to other infectious viral disease with viraemia levels relevant to the detection limits of our methodology, but also to the rapid and economic detection of the causes of meningitis where time-to-diagnosis through 3 day-long, classical clinical microbiology might be disadvantageous. Most importantly, however, unlike many other approaches, the performance we report with this novel platform is achieved with 700\u00c2 less blood volume than the standard 3.5 ml needed for the gold standard Trombley assay. Studies are therefore underway to explore whether large volume PCR 68 accommodating higher amounts of patient sample at the point of care might meet and even exceed the sensitivity of the EZ1 SOP.",

In its present, diagnostically relevant, 62.5 ml reaction format, disposables for the Trombley+ assay on the QuRapID cost US$12.50 per test before scale up or subsidy, an amount relevant to developing nations and competitive to emerging electricity-free, 69 or disposable isothermal NAAT that rely on complex fabrication methods. 70 Thus, in the context of powered point-of-need solutions, the 2 minute, 10 cycle freeze/thaw process implemented in our approach adds only an additional 24 watts of energy requirement per test. This can be nonetheless additionally managed through smart thermal load sharing between active stations operating ad hoc, thereby reducing overall energy requirements during screening use. Moreover, the overhead is effectively compensated by the lack of any motorized, expensive consumables or instrument parts that could otherwise compromise instrument robustness. To extend this principle to overall process user-friendliness, we have additionally minimized to the greatest extent possible the manual steps involved in conducting RT-qPCR (ESI video online \u2020) without recourse to laboratory infrastructure or introduction of manufacturing complexity. Thus, the standard operating procedure we devised involves a disposable consumable, pre-loaded with lyophilized reagents and an automated, pre-calibrated 57.5 ml solvent dispenser to eliminate the need for refrigeration. Although the ABI Fast RT-qPCR mastermix we tested against live EBOV is not in itself amenable to lyophilisation, refrigeration-free RT-qPCR mastermix production is possible 71 and commercially available for research and diagnostic purposes. To this end, we have screened and identi\ue103ed a proprietary, lyophilisation-and bloodcompatible formulation, successfully dried and tested it as part of this work; this formulation is presently under development to match the wet assay performance characteristics reported herein.",

            "text": "On the other hand, experimental evidence is required supporting accurate detection of multiplexed RT-qPCR to support safe calling of process and diagnostic success during use of this technology. Unfortunately, in our hands, the singleplex Trombley assays and the RP control assay exhibited competitive inhibition at the lower end of analyte concentration. Reasoning that altering even primer and probe concentrations would require re-quali\ue103cation of assay speci\ue103city, we decided instead to con\ue103rm the utility of our approach against EBOV genome detection in singleplex mode. Nevertheless, the resulting \ue104uorimetric data were used to examine state of the art mathematical deconvolution approaches used in other optical platforms operating in the same spectral ranges. This analysis indicated that separation of commercially available probe \ue104uorophores in the 600-750 nm range is adequately assayed spectrophotometrically, and that the signal to noise ratio of a \ue104uorophore might direct its use in a multiplexed fashion. Thus, an example dye trio consisting of CAL635, Quasar 670 and Quasar 705 could enable migration of an established triplex assay to the far red, blood-compatible spectrum, but the signal to noise ratio of Quasar 705 in the context of blood would make this \ue104uorophore suitable only for the detection of a high copy number control. Encouragingly, the spectral data obtained throughout these studies with Quasar 670-labelled probes are in line with our predictive modelling efforts regarding peak ratiometry. Thus, \ue104uorigenic data normalization clearly exhibits adequate assay window in reliably detecting emission peak changes as no deviation in ratiometric pro\ue103les was detected for Quasar 670 relative to other dye emission peaks. Efforts are thus underway to implement automated Ct calling in multiplex mode as well as viral genome quanti\ue103cation through reagent pre-calibration based on our observations across AR14 and the two distinct EBOV strains we tested. Overall, whether substitution of probebased detection chemistry with DNA stains and high-resolution melt will enable further cost reductions in the future will largely depend on the relative diagnostic reliability, computational, and energy requirements of the two approaches when used in the presence of blood vs. already available, highly reliable probe assays.",

Thus, stockpiling notwithstanding, we estimate that BSL4 laboratories with robust reagent supply chains could independently deliver mass screening, mass production-ready assays within a fortnight.
