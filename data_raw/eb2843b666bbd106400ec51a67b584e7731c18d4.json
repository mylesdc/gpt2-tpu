Finding the partners MAGE-G1 interacting with will surely contribute to the function study of MAGE-G1. In this study, using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics, we screened the interacting proteins of MAGE-G1 during retinoic acid -induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells and firstly found that FSCN1 and VIME were potential novel MAGE-G1-interacting proteins. Then, the interaction between overexpressed MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME was validated by GSTpull down assay in bacteria and by co-immunoprecipitation assay in COS7 cells. Endogenous coimmunoprecipitation assay further confirmed that MAGE-G1 interacted with FSCN1 or VIME in P19 cells after a 6-day retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Those results provide a functional linkage between MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME and may facilitate a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of MAGE-G1 during neurogenesis.",

Both type I and type II MAGE proteins share a conserved domain known as the MAGE homology domain (MHD). Based on similarities in the MHD sequences and molecular sizes, the type II MAGE proteins can be divided further into two subgroups, Necdin subgroup and MAGE-D subgroup. Necdin subgroup consists of relatively short proteins (< 350 amino acid residues) whose MHD sequences are more homologous to that of Necdin. This subgroup includes Necdin, MAGE-F1, MAGE-G1, and MAGE-H1 in mammals. MAGE-D subgroup consists of larger proteins (> 650 amino acid residues), including MAGE-D1/NRAGE/Dlxin-1, MAGE-D2, MAGE-D3/Trophinin/ Magphinin, MAGE-E1/MAGE-D4, and MAGE-L2 2,3 .",

The proximal region of human chromosomal 15q is subject to genomic imprinting and implicated in various human neurological and mental disorders including Prader Willi Syndrome, Angelman syndrome, autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia 5 . It is demonstrated that MAGE-G1 has some characteristics similar to those of Necdin, such as growth suppression and interactions with E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) 6 . MAGE-G1 is a member of type II MAGE proteins of which some member are key elements in neurogenesis, such as MAGE-D1, MAGE-L2 2,7 . Our previous studies found that the expression of MAGE-G1 protein was increased with the differentiation of P19 8 . Those findings suggest that the MAGE-G1 may be involved in brain development, and its abnormalities may cause some neurodevelopmental diseases. However, the biochemical and functional features of MAGE-G1in brain development and neurogenesis remain unknown.",

A number of techniques are used to screen unknown interacting proteins, which include the yeast two-hybrid system, pull-down assays, as well as tandem affinity purification (TAP) 9, 10 . However, those techniques suffer from high false positive and false negative rates, because the assay is usually performed under non-physiological conditions and the posttranslational dynamics are not taken into account. Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC)-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics provides a useful tool to overcome the disadvantages mentioned above 11 . Using this method to screen interacting proteins, specific partners appear as isotopically heavy, while non-specific interaction partners appear as a mixture of isotopically light and heavy at a 1:1 ratio. The SILAC-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics has some significant advantages in identification of interaction partners. For example, the cell localization and post-translational modifications are not perturbed; as a quantitative approach, it allows the user to readily distinguish non-specifically interacting proteins from host factors that bind specifically; this method enables the identification of not only direct interacting partners but also low affinity or indirect interacting partners 12, 13 .",

However, certain highly abundant proteins, such as cytoskeletal proteins, histones, hnRNP proteins, and ribosomal proteins, were also included in the list. Based on the previous report 15 , they are in the class of \"beads proteome\", i.e., proteins that often bind to the agarose beads where the Flag antibody is conjugated to, therefore, co-purify with the \"true\" interacting partners during the process of immunoprecipitation. Thus, after excluding these unspecific proteins, FSCN1 and VIME were identified as potential MAGE-G1-interacting proteins formed during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells.

To confirm the interaction between MAGE-G1 and VIME, we analyzed the association of these two proteins by GST pull-down assay in bacteria and by immunoprecipitation in transfected mammalian cells. GST or GST-VIME expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 were incubated with Flag-MAGE-G1 expressed in HEK293T, and precipitated by Glutathione-Sepharose 4B Scientific RepoRts | 7:44699 | DOI: 10.1038/srep44699 beads. The result showed that Flag-MAGE-G1 were detected respectively in the GST-VIME precipitate (Fig. 5a) . Expression vectors Flag-Mage-g1 and GFP-Vime were constructed and transiently co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Empty vectors pCMV-3 \u00d7 Flag and pGFP-N1 were used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis were performed on cell lysates from those transfected cells. The result showed that GFP-VIME was detected in the anti-Flag immunoprecipitate from COS-7 cells co-transfected with Flag-Mage-g1 and GFP-Vime, but not detected in COS-7 cells co-transfected with pCMV-3 \u00d7 Flag and GFP-Vime (Fig. 5b) . Similarly, Flag-MAGE-G1 was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitate from COS-7 cells co-transfected with Flag-Mage-g1 and GFP-Vime, but not in COS-7 cells co-transfected with pGFP-N1 and Flag-Mage-g1 (Fig. 5c) .",

To explore whether the interactions between MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME function in RA-induced neuronal differentiation process, we performed endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments using P19 cells which stayed different stages of RA-induced neuronal differentiation. P19 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 1 \u03bc M RA for 4 days, and then were replanted in N2 serum-free medium for another 2, 4, 6 days to induce differentiation. Proteins were extracted by IP Lysis Buffer and immunoprecipitated respectively by related antibody. The immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting. P19 cells cultured in RA-containing medium for 0, 2, 4 days were used as control. The test showed that the expression of MAGE-G1 in P19 cells increased with differentiation time, but the expression of FSCN1 and VIME were constant in P19 cells (Fig. 6) . With the increase of MAGE-G1 expression, FSCN1 (Fig. 6a) or VIME (Fig. 6b ) detected by co-IP was increased correspondingly. There was no FSCN1 or VIME detected in immunoprecipitate from control groups in which MAGE-G1 did not express or expressed at a low level. Those results showed that the MAGE-G1 expression was increased with the differentiation time and the interactions between MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME strengthen as well.",

It suggested that MAGE-G1 might play a significant role in the early process of neurogenesis. However, the detailed function of MAGE-G1 in neurogenesis remains unclear. To date, only two proteins, E2F1 and p75NTR, have been found interact with MAGE-G1. Previous studies found that MAGE-G1 could reduce cell proliferation, and such effect was mediated by its interaction with the E2F1 transcriptional activator. Interaction of MAGE-G1 with the p75NTR may be involved in brain development 6 . In this study, based on the model of RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, SILAC-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics was used to identify interaction partners of MAGE-G1. After analysis and validation, FSCN1 and VIME were found to be interacted with MAGE-G1 during RA-induced neuronal differentiation. However, two known MAGE-G1 interactors, E2F1 and p75NTR, were not identified in our experiment. We speculated that our IP lysis buffer was too mild to extract membrane protein p75NTR and nucleoprotein E2F1.",

            "text": "FSCN1 also binds to noncytoskeletal proteins. FSCN1 is a substrate of protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1 ) in vitro and in vivo 31 . The phosphorylation of FSCN1 at Ser-39 inhibits its actin-bundling activity and confers an additional activity, binding of the regulatory domain of active PKC\u03b1 32 . A third interaction of FSCN1 is with the cytoplasmic domain of the p75NTR 33 . Interestingly, p75NTR could also interact with MAGE-G1 6 , which was identified to be an interactor of FSCN1 in this study. So it was suggested that the interaction between FSCN1, p75NTR and MAGE-G1 may induce a direct effect of neurotrophins on actin cytoskeletal rearrangement changes during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. VIME is one of the highly conserved proteins of the type III intermediate filament (IF) protein family. During development, VIME expression is predominant in the primitive streak stage, while in adults VIME expression is limited to connective tissue mesenchymal cells, in CNS and in muscle 34 . VIME has been shown to participate in a number of critical functions, often related to organization of proteins that are involved in adhesion, migration, and cell signaling. Recently, many different studies have linked VIME to signal transduction and it has been suggested that they would act as signaling platforms and scaffolds for signaling molecules. VIME can interact with RhoA-binding kinase \u03b1 (ROK\u03b1 ) that directly phosphorylate VIME 35 . The activation of RhoA resulted in a ROK\u03b1 -dependent collapse of the VIME network with simultaneous release of ROK\u03b1 bound to VIME filaments and translocation of ROK\u03b1 to the cell periphery 35 . VIME networks can also interact with kinases that do not directly phosphorylate VIME. VIME is associated with Raf-1 kinase and activation of the kinase induces VIME phosphorylation 36 . VIME phosphorylation is also controlled by PKC\u03b5 interacted with VIME on the membrane vesicles 37 . In this study, we found that VIME could be interacted with MAGE-G1 during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, and those findings imply that VIME filaments might work as a binding platform for MAGE-G1 signaling pathway, or its crosstalk with above mentioned VIME-involved signaling pathway during neuronal differentiation.",
