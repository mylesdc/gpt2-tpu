With novel emerging infectious diseases being reported across different parts of the world, there is a need to build systems that can track, monitor and report such events in a timely manner. Further, it is also important to identify susceptible geographic regions and populations where emerging diseases may have a significant impact. Methods: In this paper, we present an overview of Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit (ORBiT), which we have developed specifically to address data analytic challenges in the realm of public health surveillance. In particular, ORBiT provides an extensible environment to pull together diverse, large-scale datasets and analyze them to identify spatial and temporal patterns for various biosurveillance-related tasks. Results: We demonstrate the utility of ORBiT in automatically extracting a small number of spatial and temporal patterns during the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season using claims data. These patterns provide quantitative insights into the dynamics of how the pandemic flu spread across different parts of the country. We discovered that the claims data exhibits multi-scale patterns from which we could identify a small number of states in the United States (US) that act as \"bridge regions\" contributing to one or more specific influenza spread patterns. Similar to previous studies, the patterns show that the south-eastern regions of the US were widely affected by the H1N1 flu pandemic. Several of these south-eastern states act as bridge regions, which connect the north-east and central US in terms of flu occurrences. Conclusions: These quantitative insights show how the claims data combined with novel analytical techniques can provide important information to decision makers when an epidemic spreads throughout the country. Taken together ORBiT provides a scalable and extensible platform for public health surveillance.",

            "text": "Public health surveillance is the continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data for planning, implementing and evaluating public health practice. It can serve as an effective vehicle for monitoring epidemiology of various health problems, including infectious (e.g., flu, West Nile Virus, Ebola, etc.) and chronic (e.g., diabetes, cancer, etc.) health conditions, documenting the impact of interventions and/or tracking progress of specific health goals, and serve as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies [1] . As emerging and re-emerging pathogens, such as the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in West Africa [2] and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks [3] , become more prevalent, developing effective public health surveillance systems is a priority for ensuring national security. Additionally, with the continued increase in the number of asthma, diabetes and other chronic disease conditions, there is an immediate need to develop tools that can aid decision makers (e.g., public health officials, physicians, epidemiologists and policy/law-makers) with critical information that can eventually translate into effective health policies. With an estimated 50-60 million patients diagnosed every year and continued growth of medical expenses-related to these conditions, the combined effect of these diseases is an extraordinary socioeconomic burden, which can only be overcome by developing effective public health surveillance systems.",

Taken together, these different datasets can exceed several petabytes of data that have to be integrated and analyzed to obtain even basic insights into how diseases spread within geographically separated populations.",

            "text": "With the digitization of health-related information and web-based platforms that promote self-reporting (through Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites), there has been an exponential growth of data available for public health surveillance. Current platforms for biosurveillance make use of event-based, unstructured data such as news feed aggregators and other publicly available data to monitor for emerging infectious disease spread within geographically distributed populations. Examples of such systems include the BioSense 2.0 program [4] , GPHIN (Global Public Health Information Network) [5] , PHIN (Public Health Information Network) [6] , ProMED-Mail [7] , HealthMap [8] , Google Flu Trends, Bio-Caster, EpiSPIDER [9] , EARS (Early Aberration Reporting System), BCON (biosurveillance Common Operating Network), PHESS (Indiana Public Health Emergency Surveillance System), LAHVA (Linked Animal-Human Health Visual Analytics), ESSENCE (Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics) [10] , RODS (Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance) [11] , and GEIS (Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Reporting System) [12] . A detailed overview of these systems and their applications is further described in Shmueli and Burkhom [13] . These systems include tools for natural language processing (NLP) for parsing unstructured textual data, basic statistical analyses tools, time-series counts/ratios as well as geographic information system (GIS) based visualization that can summarize to the end-user the nature or urgency of an emerging infectious disease. It must be noted that most tools developed are specific to infectious diseases; although the tools can be used to analyze other noninfectious diseases, they are very rarely utilized for monitoring such conditions.",

Self-reporting tools such as micro-blogging and social media are also becoming effective proxies for public health surveillance [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , although such datasets also have relatively higher noise and teasing out relevant information for specific disease conditions can be quite challenging [25] .",

While EHRs refer to an individual patient's medical history collected and processed at individual medical facilities (such as a clinic or hospital), claims refer to electronic records of claim transactions processed by retail pharmacies (and/or clinics). EHR and claims provide rich and timely information regarding prevailing medical conditions in any given geographic area; however, the use of EHR and claims for public health surveillance is still in its early stages. Privacy and security-related concerns, data disparity across diverse/individual clinics/hospitals, as well the sheer complexity involved in aggregating and processing such large-scale structured datasets can pose significant data analytic challenges for even simple public health surveillance tasks [31, 32] .",

While there is significant agreement within the public health community regarding the use of data analytics and informatics techniques as being central to the success of any biosurveillance program, the development of machine learning and data analytic techniques specifically designed to handle heterogeneous datasets at massive scales has been especially challenging. These challenges can be attributed to the lack of standards and tools that facilitate data/information exchange and secondly, to the lack of available data analytic frameworks that can automatically integrate heterogeneous datasets and analyze them in near real-time to provide insights into emerging public health problems. Additionally, the complex etiologies of diseases pose special challenges in developing analytic tools to monitor them. For example, the symptoms of the common flu and a serious outbreak such as West Nile virus can be very similar, but teasing out these symptoms from a context specific search of Twitter and other social media data can be quite challenging. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel machine learning tools that can not only handle large datasets, but can also simultaneously examine heterogeneous data sets to identify emerging patterns of disease spread across geographically distributed regions.",

For organizing the data based on a specific geographic location, we used the provider's primary five digit zip code that was directly accessible from the claims data. Note that this assumption is reasonable, given that the patient's service provider/pharmacy is most likely to be co-located unless the patient remotely consults with his/her provider.

To explore the further use of claims data and to perform a retrospective analysis of the 2009-2010 pandemic flu within the US, we organized the ILI-related data from claims into a matrix A, that has the overall dimensions of N z \u00d7 N t , where N z represents the total number of zip codes and N t represents the total number of time points (365 days).",

Given prior knowledge that there are at least three distinct 'peaks' associated with the 2009-2010 pandemic [37] , we want to extract low-dimensional representations for this claims data. Further, the flu incidence matrices have non-negative entries (i.e., it is not possible to obtain a negative count of patients reporting flu symptoms at a zip code). Hence, we used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a technique to extract low-rank approximations from the claims data. Given a data matrix A with non-negative values, with dimensions N z \u00d7 N t , NMF finds low-rank approximation (s) of the form A = WH, where W (N z \u00d7 s) captures spatial patterns and H (s \u00d7 N t ) describes temporal patterns within the data. Using the alternate least squares algorithm proposed by Paatero, available as part of Matlab, we ran NMF for 1,000 iterations. To identify an appropriate low-rank subspace (s), we iterated over s = 1 . . . 15, dividing the original data into training and testing data. We tracked the residual errors using the Frobenius norm for both training and testing data. For each choice of s, we performed a total of 250 iterations. Once the optimal s was selected, we report the most stable version of the basis matrices (W, H) by computing the KL divergence between every pair of the 250 instances of W from the training set and picking W with the lowest KL divergence value.",

Not surprisingly, the overall US ILI-incidence rates over time reflects a similar behavior across both the claims and GFT data. The average agreement (quantified by the Pearson correlation) between the GFT and claims data is about 0.9 (with a p-value of 4E-11), even within individual HHS regions. However, the similarity is less pronounced with respect to the agreement between the CDC ILINet data and IMS Health claims data; we speculate that the publicly available information from ILINet has several incomplete entries for the same time period. Therefore, when we compare the data in a similar way to the GFT approach by removing the missing entries and extracting time segments which have reported data available, the agreement increases to about 0.9 (p-value of 4E-11).",

GFT data relies on a statistical model to identify search queries related to influenza. The ILINet data is primarily collected from outpatient visits and covers a small portion of the primary care facilities within the entire country. The claims data is, however, dependent on the primary care physician's reporting of transactions, which can vary across the nation (see next subsection).

As is well documented from previous studies [38, 37, 39] , HHS-I and II correspond to the northeast (states including NY, NJ, CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) that exhibited a distinct early onset of the flu pandemic followed by the peak observed in Oct-Nov 2009.

Based on this simple filtering, the total number of zip codes with reported flu cases (N z ) was 14,098 and we used N t to be 365 days. Instead of examining weekly reports as discussed above, we used a daily resolution to fully leverage the claims data. Further, we also wanted to test the hypothesis that a daily resolution of the pandemic flu season will provide fine-grained insights into distinct patterns of how the flu spread. As summarized in Figure 2 , only a small number of dimensions are sufficient to describe the pandemic flu outbreak throughout the US. To select the number of dimensions, we plotted the reconstruction error (i.e., fraction of unexplained variance) versus the subspace for the 250 repetitions of NMF (Figure 2A) , and compared this with the reconstruction error obtained with PCA performed on the original data (PCA orig ) and the scrambled data (PCA scram ; Figure 2B ). As observed, the slope of PCA scram is quite small and relatively constant for increasing subspace sizes. This provides a means to estimate the subspace size beyond which a given model is explaining noise rather than correlations in the data [40] . To visualize this cut-off, in Figure 2C we plot the change in variance for each added dimension (differences between successive points in Figure 2B ). The reconstruction error rates of both PCA orig with PCA scram at subspace around s = 12. Although it is possible to choose s = 12 and describe the spatial and temporal patterns, we use a smaller subspace (s = 5) to describe the 2009 H1N1 pan-demic. This is mainly due to the fact that we wanted a simpler representation of this high dimensional space and traded the interpretability of a lower dimensional representation for the complexity of patterns when s = 12. Further, lower number of dimensions (s < 5) do not provide a clear separation of the temporal/spatial patterns and hence we have chosen to detail our analysis with a subspace size of 5.",

Another notable aspect of H 5 is that the early peak of the ILI-incidence is followed by a secondary peak in and around the same time of H 1 , indicating that the likely presence of an early flu season (in the spring season) also influenced the late peaks observed in the fall season (see below for explanation of the spatial patterns observed).

We must note here that a more detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal patterns is required. Additionally, within the scope of this paper, we have not examined whether these patterns correspond to other well known algorithms such as Google Flu. Finally, we must also note that the predictive aspects of our algorithm have also not been fully explored for two reasons: (1) the data available to us is only from the 2009-2010 flu season and (2) it is difficult to obtain a baseline behavior based on a year that showed highly anomalous behavior in terms of the overall flu incidence across the entire country. We will explore these questions in greater detail in a following publication.",

The prescription transactions, in addition to providing counts of patients that were prescribed antiviral medications, also record the dosage of these drugs and hence can provide tighter bounds on the number of estimated people infected and measure the intensity of spread. Such a collective integration of claims and Rx datasets can provide novel insights not only in the context of understanding the flu, but can have a wide impact in general for more complex disease etiologies and chronic disease conditions.",

The temporal patterns shown in Figure 3 indicate different phases of the H1N1 flu epidemic. The multi-scale representation of the H1N1 epidemiological spread can be used as starting points for other complex types of analysis. For example, one extension would be to include evolutionary history of different H1N1 viral strains. The recent availability of large-scale sequence databases such as GISAID [41] can provide insights into specific viral strains that are prevalent within a geographic region. Tracing the phylogenetic relationship between different strains of the virus, we can then estimate parameters for disease spread models [42] .",

However, we have not described all the capabilities within ORBiT. Apart from supporting machine learning algorithms from direct sources for public health surveillance, ORBiT can be used in other contexts including (1) extracting and analyzing emerging, indirect datasets for public health surveillance, e.g., Twitter [34] ; and (2) integrating datasets such as claims to estimate parameters for disease spread models so that one can turn the analytical power from the aforementioned application into predictive models that can aid decision makers with more accurate insights [44] .
