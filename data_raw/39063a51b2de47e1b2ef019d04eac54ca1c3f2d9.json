Disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated. Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2015, twenty snow leopards in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring. Blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques. The animals showed no clinical signs of disease, however, serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected. These pathogens included, Coxiella burnetii, (25% prevalence), Leptospira spp., (20%), and Toxoplasma gondii (20%). Ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Conclusions: The zoonotic pathogens identified in this study, in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards, but have caused illness in other wild felids. Therefore, surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longerterm disease impacts on this snow leopard population.",

The rarity of endangered species makes them challenging to sample systematically, but constant surveillance and collection of baseline health data with ongoing monitoring will aid in determining the impacts of disease in threatened species.",

The population of reproductive snow leopards is believed to be fewer than 4500 and is continuing to decline [5, 6] . In 2008, the Snow Leopard Trust and Snow Leopard Conservation Fund initiated an ongoing, long-term ecological study of snow leopards in the South Gobi Province of Mongolia. During 2011 the field team recorded four snow leopard carcasses on separate locations, three within the study area in the Tost Mountains and one in the Gurvan Saikhan Mountain range, an adjacent range to the northeast. The causes of mortality were not established. There were no signs of trauma or starvation therefore other potential causes of death included infectious diseases. Two of the dead snow leopards were radio-collared territorial males with no overlap in their home ranges, suggesting independent causes of death. The finding of these dead snow leopards prompted the initiation of this disease study.",

Due to the low numbers of snow leopards available for sampling, combined with the possibility of other species endemic to the area that could act as reservoir hosts for pathogens combined with the closeness of the nomadic herders to all components of their environment, we decided to target zoonotic pathogens that can circulate between different host species and hence also impact the health of snow leopards. The zoonotic pathogens selected to sample for were based on prior occurrence in Mongolia, pathogenicity, the potential to infect snow leopards and potential economic losses for the herders. These pathogens included Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira spp. Two of the most severe zoonoses, anthrax and rabies, are known to occur within the study area but were not tested for as we were looking at prior exposure and not active infection. The potential of identifying positive results for those two pathogens would have been highly unlikely because of their extreme pathogenicity [22, 23] .",

The area is also home to approximately 90 herder families, their goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), horses (Equus caballus), camels (Camelus bactrianus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Other wild species in the area include the grey wolf (Canis lupus), corsac fox (Vulpes corsac), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Eurasian wildcat (Felis silvestris) and several members of the mustelid family [24, 25] .

This technique was based on the amount of muscle over the shoulders and hips and whether the outline of ribs, scapular spine and iliac crest were visible and could be palpated. If scapular spine and iliac crest of hip bones were prominent, then the body condition was 'poor'; if bony prominences were difficult to palpate the body condition was rated 'good'. In between these two extremes, body condition was scored as 'moderate'. Pelage was examined for thickness, signs of rubbing, alopecia and wounds. Eyes were examined for any sign of injury or defects. The oral cavity, including tongue and gingiva, were inspected for inflammation, ulcers or other lesions. Teeth were also examined as one of the indicators of age, or to see if broken or infected. Age estimation was based on body mass and tooth wear and tooth colouration [27] . The animals develop a darker cream tooth colour as they age. Scarring of the face in males was also used as an approximate indicator of age as younger males (<two-three years) have few or no scars [27] . Presumably older males obtain facial scars from territorial or resource fights. Females that had not apparently reproduced (< three years of age) typically had nipples that were lighter in colour and smaller than those of known reproductive females.",

These pathogens have not been identified in wild snow leopards before. They can cause serious infections [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , even if all snow leopards in this study appeared healthy. Data from radio telemetry showed that the individuals that were seropositive for these pathogens survived for at least 12 to 24 months after collection of samples. This findings show that snow leopards can survive infections by these pathogens without apparent adverse long-term effects. However, we cannot rule out unobserved adverse impacts from these or other pathogens, if the health of animals is reduced for other reasons. It could also be that some animals succumbed to the effects of infection prior to capture and sampling. These pathogens may also have sub-lethal effects on reproduction that are difficult to quantify. Infections in wild animals may be exacerbated by complex co-factors that reduce health. For example, immune suppression due to stressors such as nutritional compromise, wounds from fighting followed by secondary bacterial infection, other traumas and extreme environmental conditions may affect the pathogenicity of disease. An example is canine distemper virus (CDV) causing a fatal outbreak in lions (Panthera leo) [2] . Lion deaths were associated with a heavy co-infection of the haemoparasite Babesia combined with the immunosuppressive effects of CDV. In that study, there were increased ticks, vectors of Babesia, on ungulate prey due to an extreme drought followed by heavy rains [2] .",

An increase in inbreeding depression can have an impact on the immune system response (for example, a decrease of the variability of the major histocompatibility complex genes as seen in the endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) [44, 45] . This could impair the snow leopards' immune system and hence ability to resist infection, therefore, increasing the risk of mortality linked to these pathogens. This is an extinction vortex, where a species is subjected to multiple stressors (associated with poaching, habitat destruction extreme weather conditions), which will accelerate mortality rates because of the impact of a lower resistance of the immune system to disease and a lower adaptive potentiality to each stressor [46, 47] . Therefore there is a need for continual, long-term disease surveillance of snow leopards, including necropsies of dead animals to determine disease impacts. If dead snow leopards are found in the future, protocols need to be in place so that appropriate samples can be collected to determine the cause of death. Due to the risk of exposure to highly noxious zoonoses such as anthrax and plague, personnel trained in sample collection along with a necropsy kit complete with personal protection gear for sampling must be used.",

            "text": "The origin of the identified pathogens is unknown. Nor is it known if snow leopards can act as reservoirs of infection or whether they are dead-end hosts or part of a transmission cycle. Rodents, dogs and goats sampled within the study area were positive for exposure to the same pathogens (i.e. C. burnetii, T. gondii and Leptospira spp.) in concurrent studies in the region (Esson et al. unpublished data). The snow leopards also overlapped with scavengers, such as raptors and foxes at kill sites, allowing for indirect interactions with other potential hosts and the pathogens they shed. These indirect interactions could include sharing environmental resources that are contaminated with pathogens such as water bodies and thereby being parasitised by common water-borne pathogens. Again this warrants longterm studies on this population of snow leopards to elucidate the source(s) of the pathogens identified in the study and other pathogens that may be present that were not tested for. Felids are the definitive hosts for T. gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan with a complex life cycle [40, 41, 48] . Broadly, transmission occurs when oocysts are shed in the faeces by the definitive host and then consumed by an intermediate host, which can be a rodent or another mammal [40] . Antibodies to T. gondii occurred in 20% of the snow leopards tested, including males and females and across all years of the study. The cub (F8) of F7 was negative to T. gondii, suggesting that F7 did not have an active infection during pregnancy or the pathogen did not cross the placenta in this case. Toxoplasma gondii can be transmitted horizontally via an intermediate host or vertically from the mother [49] . F7 may also have acquired the infection after giving birth. These results indicate that snow leopards in this region may be acting as a reservoir host for this parasite. Toxoplasma gondii was identified in Pallas cats in an amaig (Province) north of the study area in 2005 [50] and has only recently been identified in humans in Mongolia [51] . We could not find any other report or publication about T. gondii in other species in Mongolia, so the prevalence of this parasite across the country is unclear. The snow leopards in our study did not appear to be impacted negatively by this parasite, however, negative effects have been observed to occur in other wild felids from infection with T.gondi. These include the death of a juvenile bobcat (Lynx rufus) from acute toxoplasmosis, and a juvenile cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) a Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and two lions, which all died from acute disseminated toxoplasmosis [15, 50, [52] [53] [54] . Pallas cats also inhabit the same area as snow leopards, are extremely susceptible to infection with T. gondii [50] . This pathogen therefore can have detrimental effects on members of the definitive host family [55] so it would be prudent to continue long-term monitoring of the snow leopards to determine if negative impacts do occur. The snow leopards may also act as a reservoir for this pathogen for contamination by intermediate hosts. Toxoplasmosis is a severe zoonosis, that can cause neurological problems in the foetus and adults of its intermediate hosts and spill-over hosts including humans [38, 39] . This could pose a public health risk to the nomadic people of the region.",

            "text": "Coxiella burnetii, the aetiological agent of Q fever, is common in Mongolian domestic animals [50] but has not been reported in wildlife in this region. Therefore, the role wildlife plays in transmission or as a reservoir host of this pathogen is unknown. Antibodies to this pathogen were detected in five of 20 snow leopards including both males and females. This is the first time C. burnetii has been recorded in this species in the wild. Although very few species of wild felids have been tested for this pathogen, it has been detected in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) [56, 57] . These studies provide an overview of the level of infection in free-roaming felines and highlight their potential zoonotic risk to humans. Fourteen wild caught Pallas' cats near the Russian-Mongolian border were reported to be negative for C. burnetii in 2010 [50] . However, C. burnetii has been detected in other felid species in captivity, such as in aclinical lions in a zoo [58] . Felids, including domestic cats (Felis catus), have been identified as potential reservoir hosts for the bacteria and a source of infection for humans and other animals [59] [60] [61] . The presence of C. burnetii antibodies in the snow leopards suggests they may function as a part of the epidemiological cycle of C. burnetii just as domestic cats have been reported to do in other regions [62] . Assessment of the role of wild and domestic hosts as potential reservoirs of misdiagnosed zoonoses, such as Q fever by C. burnetii, is an important public health issue today both for wildlife conservation and management of disease in the human-livestock-wildlife interface [56, 63] . Coxiella burnetii can cause abortions, mainly in ruminants, however, its pathogenicity in cats has not been established to date [64] . F8 who was positive for C. burnetii was the cub of F7 who was also positive for C. burnetii suggesting vertical transmission of the pathogen or common and continual exposure of this pathogen. Continued monitoring of this population is necessary to assess potential effects on reproduction. As DNA was collected from all animals, parentage of future captures can be determined which in turn can reveal possible effects of C. burnetii on subsequent reproduction. The snow leopards may have been exposed to C. burnetii when preying on domestic goats, ibex or rodents that also inhabit the area. These species also tested positive for exposure to this pathogen in concurrent studies (Esson unpublished). Coxiella burnetii is extremely resistant to environmental conditions being able to withstand cold temperatures and UV light so that it could remain viable in the Mongolian environment for extended time-periods [65] . Ruminants are the primary carriers of this pathogen and shed it in their milk, blood, placenta and faeces [58, 61] . However, ticks can act as vectors and other mammals such as rodents can also carry C. burnetii [57, 66, 67] . Vaccinating domestic stock would help control transmission among livestock and potential spill over to native ungulates such as ibex and Argali sheep by reducing the deposition of pathogens onto shared grazing regions. Vaccinating against C. burnetii would also potentially help mitigate the potential risk of spill-over to people, dogs and other wildlife, including snow leopards. Ticks from three of the snow leopards tested positive for unidentified species of Coxiella but were not from those snow leopards that were seropositive for C. burnetii. It is possible that the hosts did not have time to develop antibodies prior to sampling during the study. The role of ticks in the transmission of C. burnetii is unknown [67] and thus warrants further research.",

            "text": "Four snow leopards tested positive for Leptospira antibodies via ELISA, two of which were positive for L. interrogans Australis via MAT. Mean agglutination test is considered the 'gold standard' for identification of Leptospira serovars [68] . Leptospira interrogans Australis is considered one of the pathogenic serovars of the genus Leptospira [68] . Leptospira interrogans Australis has not previously been identified in any Mongolian species so the finding of previous exposure in snow leopards is important from a public health point of view. The identification of this pathogen indicates there is a potential reservoir in the area that the snow leopards and other wildlife, domestic animals and people can be exposed to. Other Leptospira serovars than Australis have been reported in other wild felid species, but the effects are still unclear [69] . Two of the snow leopards that were positive for T. gondii were also positive for Leptospira, showing they have been exposed to multiple pathogens. No typical clinical signs of infection were observed for either of these two individuals (e.g. pyrexia, jaundice), similar to results from captive neotropical felids in Brazil where an ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and a female marguay (Leopardus wiedii) tested positive to two different serovars of Leptospira without showing clinical signs of disease [69, 70] . Leptospira spp. are spirochaete bacteria that reside in the kidney tubules, with rodents being a significant reservoir for the bacteria, exhibiting no clinical signs of disease [71] , however other mammals including cats have also been reported as reservoirs of the pathogen [72] . Leptospira interrogans Hardjo was the most common serovar in cattle and horses reported in two other provinces of Mongolia [32, 73] and ten other serovars were identified in dogs in other provinces of Mongolia [31] . Wild and domestic carnivores in Spain with Leptospira spp. antibodies commonly had interstitial glomerular nephritis upon necropsy, despite not exhibiting clinical signs of disease [15] . It was suggested that these carnivores were terminal hosts, unable to transmit the disease [15] . Leptospirosis could, therefore, potentially shorten the lifespan of the animals that were positive for Leptospira in our study, if sufficient renal damage has occurred. Leptospira spp. are readily transmitted to humans and is a zoonosis of global importance [42] .",

The genus of major concern comprised Bacillus spp., which can include B. anthracis that causes anthrax and B. piliformis that causes Tyzzer's disease. The latter has previously been described in captive snow leopards where it caused fatal infections [12] . Other genera identified were Coxiella spp. and Rickettsia spp. that include species that cause anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, both intracellular bacteria that infect and destroy white blood cells, plus Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp [74] [75] [76] . For the majority of these pathogens, there are no previous reports of occurrence in snow leopards in the wild or in captive settings. However, based on our results it would be prudent to test for the presence of these bacteria in future health-screening studies on this and other snow leopard populations. In our study, the snow leopards that tested positive for C. burnetii antibodies showed no clinical signs of illness and survived for at least 12 to 24 months. The presence of Coxiella spp. in ticks may indicate a mechanism of transmission of the pathogen between snow leopards and other hosts as it has in other species [63, 67] .",

This study is the first to detect exposure of wild snow leopards to zoonotic pathogens. Potential sources of the three pathogens identified that is Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira interrogans Australis, include snow leopard prey such as wild and domestic ungulates and overlap with scavengers, such as raptors and foxes at kill sites, allowing indirect interactions with other potential hosts and the pathogens they shed. Such potential indirect interactions could include sharing of common resources that are contaminated with pathogens such as water bodies and being parasitized by water-borne pathogens.",

Identification of these pathogens was based on antibody identification from prior exposure and not an active infection. For species where there is limited information, such as the snow leopard, there is a distinct need to continue long-term monitoring of their health to generate comprehensive baseline knowledge of what are normal parameters. Monitoring the survival and condition of animals over time can be achieved through radio-collaring, continual collection and testing of samples as per this study. Only through continued monitoring, including disease surveillance, can we start to understand the threats to this endangered species. with the laboratory work.
