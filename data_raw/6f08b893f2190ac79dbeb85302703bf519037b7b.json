To be eligible, foreign scientists must meet at least one of the following criteria: 1) at least 2 years of research training experience under an FIC-supported training grant (classified by the D43 and U2R mechanisms); 2) 1 year of such D43 or U2R training experience coupled with 1 year of significant, well-documented, mentored research experience (e.g., through an NIH research award such as the NIAID Small Research (R03) Grant (IRID-NIAID) program); 3) 1 year of the NIDA INVEST or Humphrey Fellowship (http://www. drugabuse.gov/International/HHHRF.html) plus at least one additional year of significant, well-documented, mentored research; 4) at least 2 years of research training experience through the NIH Intramural Visiting Fellows Program; 5) 1 year of training through an F05 international fellowship program and 1 subsequent year of mentored research; 6) recipients of Long-Term Fellowship awards through the Human Frontier Science Program, who come from low-and middle-income countries, and who have spent at least 2 years in research training; 7) at least 1 year of training in the United States and one additional year of significant, well-documented, mentored research, in the United States or abroad, leading to a completed master's degree or doctoral degree, at least partially funded through a Fogarty International Center research training program, with preapproval by the program director; 8) foreign trainee researchers from low-or middle-income countries trained under NIEHS R01, R37, and P01 programs, as described at http://www. niehs.nihgov/dert/programs/capacity.htm.",

For example, the NIH Visiting Fellows Program currently hosts more than 1,600 junior scientists from almost 100 countries for periods of 1-5 years. In addition, the NIH D43 research training and capacity building and the U2R cooperative agreement grant mechanisms allow hundreds of foreign researchers to receive training at prominent institutions in both the United States and their home countries in a range of biomedical and behavioral research areas critical to advancing global health. In summary, training supported by NIH is critical to these young investigators as they develop independent research careers.",

This is a critical adjunct in the continuation of promising independent research careers that will be of benefit to the investigators' home countries and the world at large. Women and underrepresented minority scientists in their countries are especially encouraged to apply for these re-entry grants.

Research on healthy outcomes of pregnancy and child survival, and population research as associated with both behavioral and social, and economic research is encouraged.

Many emerging viral diseases are zoonotic in origin; it is estimated that approximately 62% of human infectious diseases are zoonotic and an estimated 70% of newly emerging diseases are zoonotic in origin. The recent emergence and transmission to humans of SARS CoV from civet cats and deadly avian influenza clearly demonstrate that emerging zoonotic viral diseases are a serious public health problem that needs to be understood fully. Although it is clear that one of the principle mechanisms involved in the emergence of new viral diseases is a change in the host range, there are many gaps in our knowledge about the mechanism(s) involved and how zoonotic viruses establish themselves in humans. An understanding of these processes will be necessary to anticipate and prepare for the emergence of new viruses in humans.",

In colonizing states these human pathogens are in consortia with other microbes, such as when Staphylococcus aureus colonizes skin or mucosal tissues without causing disease or when Clostridium difficile colonizes the gut without causing illness or when Neisseria meningitidis is in the nasopharyngeal tract without causing disease. Little if anything is known about the full complement of microbes present or the structure and functioning of the microbial consortium. It is important to know what microbes are present, in what proportions, and how the consortium functions metabolically. Clearly, the consortium has an interface with the host and this may play a critical role in determining if the microbes remain as colonizers or cause disease. There are several potential colonizing niches in the body for which this concept applies such as skin, gastrointestinal, nasopharyngeal, and genitourinary tracts. Metagenomics as well as microscopic techniques that allow for visualization of the physical structure of the microbial consortium are experimental approaches of interest.",
