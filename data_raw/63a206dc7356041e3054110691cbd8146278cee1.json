            "text": "Camels are livestock with unique adaptations to hot-arid regions. To effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel DNA specimens with associated biological information is needed. We examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a DNA biobank. We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20-100\u03bcl) provided~0.4-3.6 \u03bcg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1-5) produced 0.1-12 \u03bcg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10-50) resulted in~0.7-25 \u03bcg. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient DNA for sequencing or SNP genotyping.",

The dromedary camel genome has been sequenced recently [17, 18] , which opens the door to study the camel genomically. The reference camel genome enabled the identification of genes associated with white-spotting coat color [19] , solid coat colors [20] , and \"tameness\" [21] . The aforementioned studies employed an approach that consists of sequencing candidate genes [22]-this approach is limited in utility and does not allow for exploring the wide-range of camel phenotypes. The candidate gene approach can be applied only when the biology of the phenotype is fully understood and a prior knowledge of candidate genes and their functions is available [22] . A biobank of camel DNA samples, with associated phenotypes, is needed to utilize genome sequencing and SNP genotyping technologies in linkage analyses [23] or genome-wide association studies [24] . Moreover, validating the association and possibly the causation, of the genetic variants of a given phenotype requires genotyping a large number of individuals (positive and negative for the phenotype) and examining the agreement between their genotype and phenotype [25] . This validation method will benefit greatly from a camel DNA biobank.",

DNA biobanking for genetic studies requires careful consideration of the used biological specimens, insofar as their source, and their yielded quality and quantity to enable DNA genotyping and sequencing, as well as their ease of transport, and their amenability for long-term storage prior to DNA extraction. Another important aspect to consider when establishing a DNA biobank, is the depth of the information associated with the samples collected from each specimen. Such information includes age, sex, breed, pedigree information, geographic location, phenotypic attributes (e.g. coat color and texture), morphological measurements (e.g. size and height), and productivity (e.g. milk volume, carcass weight, hide quality). To this effect, we recently developed the data collection and organization application, SamplEase [28] , that aims to expedite the collection of all the necessary information associated with each DNA sample in the envisioned camel biobank.",

By comparison, buccal swab collection only requires handling assistants, care to avoid accidental bites, sterile cytological brushes, and moderate collection time (personal observation). Tail-hair samples have the least requirements, where no special training or assistants are needed, no collection tools, and minimal camel handling time (leading to fast sample collection), and easy transportation and storage of specimens in Camel DNA from whole-blood, saliva, and tail-hair envelopes at room temperature (personal observation).

The highest amount DNA was obtained from tail-hair samples (with a maximum of 25 \u03bcg), and the lowest was from wholeblood samples (with a maximum of 4 \u03bcg). Unlike DNA extracted from buccal swabs and tailhair follicles, DNA extracted from whole-blood samples was similar both in appearance on the gel and average quantity (\u03bcg) for all five-starting whole-blood volumes used (Table 1 ; Fig 2) . This may be due to the overall low blood volumes (20-100 \u03bcl) used in this study. In other words, differences in the amount of extracted DNA might be more apparent if larger starting volumes (100-1000\u03bcl) were used instead. The overwhelming majority of extracted samples in this study were within the accepted range of DNA purity (260/280nm ratio = 1.8-2.2) (Fig 2) for DNA sequencing and genotyping [41] . Nonetheless, four out of twenty-seven DNA samples extracted from single buccal swabs exhibited noticeable low 260/280 nm ratio. This may be related to insufficient buccal cells captured by the swab or possible contaminant from animal feed. Overall, we found that a single buccal swab offered a DNA amount equivalent to 100 \u03bcl of whole-blood, however, DNA extracted from only 20-30 hair follicles was greater than that extracted from five buccal swabs combined. Given the relative ease of obtaining this number of tailhair follicles, this argues for it being superior to both whole-blood and saliva as camel DNA source.",

This indicates that among all examined DNA sources, only whole-blood shows no significant difference in the relationship between starting DNA sample quantity and extracted DNA amount (of the first elution) among individual camels. The result for saliva and tail-hair was in accordance with previous studies. For example, the variability among individual camels in extracted DNA amount from different starting amounts of buccal swabs could be explained by the different number of cells captured from each swab (e.g. see DNA quantity ranges in [42] [43] [44] ). Similarly, the variability among individual camels in extracted DNA amount from different starting amounts of tail-hair follicles could be explained by morphological variation in hair follicles between camel types, age, or sex [45] .",

The rate of DNA degradation over the examined 9-month period was similar for both saliva and tail-hair (Fig 5) , however, greater deterioration in the quality and purity of DNA obtained from saliva was observed, when compared to tail-hair (Fig 4) . This deterioration might be due to the sensitivity of cells in saliva to degradation when stored at room temperature, or even at 4\u02daC [46] . In contrast, DNA quantity from thirty tail-hair follicles averaged~5 \u03bcg and~2.0 (260/280 ratio) after being stored for 9 months. When considering all factors together, we conclude that tail-hair follicles are the best DNA source for biobanking camel specimens, given the extracted DNA quantity and quality, as well as the ease of collection, storage, and transportation.",

However, our results indicate that tail-hair follicles seem to be more optimal than these two sources for large-scale genetic studies in camels especially for its ease of collection, transport, and storage prior to DNA extraction and for providing sufficient DNA amounts for genotyping and sequencing. Camel hair was previously used for STR genotyping [30, 49] and DNA sequencing [19, 21] . Beyond the currently-employed PCR applications, STR genotyping, and targeted sequencing, based on our results, we expect that camel tail-hair can be successfully applied to current genotyping and sequencing technologies. This is driven by recent successful use of tail-hair for genome-wide SNP genotyping and association studies in cattle [50, 51] , horses [52] , and goats [53] . It is worth noting that adequate amounts of hair (i.e. 40-50 hair follicles) should be used to produce SNP genotype calls, as indicated in a comparative analysis of the genotyping success of horse blood and hair-root samples [54] . These recent studies increase the prospects of the utility of tail-hair for camel DNA biobanking and studies associated with this biobank.",
