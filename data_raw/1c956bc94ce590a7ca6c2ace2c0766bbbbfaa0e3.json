The lowest relative binding (RB) of HAV to the cells was found at pH 4.0 and in FeSO 4 solution (64.6% and 68.1%, respectively). To develop an alternative to antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of HAV using RT-PCR, the binding of HAV to five lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), was evaluated using ELISAs.

HAV, the prototype of the Hepatovirus genus within the Piconaviridae family, is composed of an icosahedral capsid that contains a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome [2, 3] . HAV infection is associated with the consumption of virus-contaminated bivalves, including oysters, clams, cockles and mussels, which accumulate the virus from seawater as they filter-feed [4] . Moreover, the increasingly widespread incidence of oyster-related HAV infection is attracting greater attention to the mechanisms underlying the interaction between HAV and oyster [5] .",

            "text": "The detection of HAV is influenced by the binding affinity of the virus for receptor cells, which is affected by the pH and ionic strength of the test solution, the presence of compounds competing for sorption, and the properties of the virus [6]. In general, low pH reduces the infectivity of enteroviruses, as it reduces the stability of virus. However, HAV shows greater stability at low pH than other enteroviruses, which increases the possibility of infection to the cells [7]. Exposing a virus to change in pH can affect binding by altering the conformation of viral proteins e.g., hemagglutinin and spike protein, which respectively mediate the binding of influenza and coronaviruses to the target cells [8, 9] . In addition, metal compounds yield specific acids in aqueous solution, so that the ionic strength of a solution will depend on the types of metals present. Consequently, the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of viruses to cells are considered to be important factors for the detection of viruses in food. To date, however, there have been few studies addressing this issue. Zajac et al. reported that Ca 2+ promotes the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells (monkey kidney cell line) [10], and Bishop et al. showed that low pH and divalent metal ions (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ) enhance the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells due to changes in the viral capsid conformation [11] . Although these studies provide useful information on the binding of HAV to BS-C-1 cells, much remains to be learned about the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of HAV to different cell types.",

The specificity of antibody-antigen binding ensures detection of the target virus [29, 30] . For example, using streptavidin magnetic beads coated with biotinylated human anti-HAV IgG, Lopez-Sabater et al. were able to capture HAV from shellfish extract and remove the interfering materials present [30] . Although many investigators have successfully applied IMS prior to RT-PCR to detect viruses, the method currently being used requires expensive antibodies from animal sources. To reduce the cost, an alternative method that replaces the requirement for virus-binding antibodies would be highly desirable.",

Moreover, the binding of lectin to HIV and human parainfluenza virus type 2 inhibits the attachment of these viruses to their receptor cells [34, 35] . For that reason, many investigators have applied lectins for the separation and isolation of viruses such as herpes simplex [33] , Rous-sarcoma [36] and turkey herpes [37] , as well as bacteria such as Streptococcus cricetus [38] , Bacillus anthracis [39] , enteric bacteria [40] and Campylobacter species [41] .

The results showed that the RB of HAV gradually declined as the solution pH decreased from 10.0-4.0 (RB: 96.4% at pH 10 to 64.6% at pH 4 ( Figure 1A) . Although, the precise reason for the lower RB at acidic pH remains uncertain, it may be associated with a pH-related conformational change within the HAV [42] or the cells. Beside these, the nature of bonding between virus and the cells could be the possible reason for lower binding at acidic pH. As previously described, the binding of viruses to shellfish mucus is either ionic or H + ion bonding, in which, increasing the H + ion concentration, that is, decreasing the pH, weakens the bonding between virus and shellfish mucus [43] . On the contrary, a previous study reported that the binding of the virus particles increased in acidic pH in adsorption/elution extraction method, in which negatively charged membrane was used as binding surface [44] . Sobsey et al. also reported that the viruses can be effectively adsorbed to nitro-cellulose and epoxy-fiber-glass filter surfaces from water at acidic pH [45] . The possible reason for difference in binding could be the differences in binding surfaces. On the other hand, Sanchez et al. showed that the binding of HAV to erythrocytes was the greatest in acidic medium [46] . They suggested this reflected the role of pH in modulating the interaction between HAV and glycophorin A, its receptor in the erythrocyte cell membrane. This implies that the difference between the RB of HAV to erythrocytes and oyster digestive cells in acidic medium likely reflects a difference in the binding receptors. The cells were exposed to HAV in buffer solutions at the indicated pHs or with the indicated metal ions. The RB was determined using ELISAs by comparing the optical densities of the test samples with that of a positive control (+ve), which consisted of cells exposed to HAV in distilled water. The negative control (\u2212ve) consisted of the cells in distilled water without HAV. Bars labeled with different letters significantly differ from one another (p < 0.05; Tukey's HSD test).",

The RB of HAV to the cells was 68.1, 79.5, 84.9, 90.3, 97.4 and 100.2% in solution containing Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + and Ca 2+ , respectively ( Figure 1B ). Thus the RB of HAV to the cells was lowest in the solution with Fe 2+ and highest in solution with Ca 2+ . Previous studies also demonstrated that HAV binding to cell receptors is enhanced by Ca 2+ ion, which results in decreased binding inhibition of virus from cell receptors [10, 47] . Notably, the pH of the Fe 2+ solution was very close to 4.0, as the pH of the Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + and Ca 2+ solutions were 3.6, 5.5, 2.8, 6.0, 5.9 and 6.3, respectively. The RB of HAV to the cells in solutions with different pH appears to be nearly comparable with the RB at the corresponding pH produced by different metal ions, though Ca 2+ is an exception. The possible explanations for the higher RB in the presence of Ca 2+ are the higher pH (6.3) of the solution and/or a ligand-like action of Ca 2+ contributing to the formation of the virus-cell complex [10] . Beside these reasons, Ca 2+ binding may alter the viral capsid structure [11] . In our study, Mg 2+ showed no significant difference in RB of HAV to the cells. Similarly, in previous study, the variation in concentration of Mg 2+ did not show a significant difference on HAV binding affinity [10] .",

The fold changes in the RB of HAV to UEA-1, HPA, DBA, PNA and SBA were 0.7, 1.0, 1.1, 1.7 and 2.3, respectively. Thus, the level of HAV binding was lowest with UEA-1 and highest with SBA.

The lectins showed different binding specificities such as mannose-, glucose-, galactose-, N-acetylglucosamine-, and N-acetylgalactosamine-specific binding [48] . For example, SBA preferentially binds galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas UAE-1 preferentially binds L-fucose [32] . Correspondingly, N-acetylgalactosamine residue was reported to be recognized by virus for binding indicating that binding of virus to lectin involves specific carbohydrate residue [49] .

The fold changes in the RB of HAV to SBA at 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 \u03bcg/mL were 1.1, 1.4, 2.2, 2.5 and 2.6, respectively.

The amplicon, which was 267 bp, was observed up to a dilution of 10 \u22124 , indicating the detection limit of RT-PCR assays to be 10 \u22124 dilution of our HAV stock (titer: 10 4 TCID 50 /mL). When we then tested the ability to detect HAV bound to SBA using serial dilutions of HAV treated with SBA (100 \u00b5g/mL), the detection limit of the RT-PCR assay was similar to that for HAV without SBA ( Figure 3B ). Finally, the limit of HAV detection using SMS combined with RT-PCR was measured by preparing serial dilutions (10-fold) of HAV treated with SBA-linked magnetic beads. The HAV that was not bound to the beads was separated as the washout fraction after washing the beads with PBS, while the HAV bound to the beads was separated as the eluent fraction using glycine solvent. The amount and type of eluent such as glycine affect the detection of virus. Therefore, the equal amount of same eluent should be added in all samples to neutralize the effect of eluent in the detection of virus. The HAV in both fractions was detected in RT-PCR assays. Figure 3C shows the amplicons in the washout and eluent fractions were detected at dilutions up to 10 \u22122 and 10 -4 , respectively. The detection of HAV in the washout fraction means that the amount of SBA-linked magnetic beads was insufficient for the volume of the sample. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS combined with RT-PCR to detect HAV in food products. However, the method will need to be optimized with respect to the virus concentration and the specificity and quantity of the lectin used. The method could be compatible with the method prescribed by International Organization for Standard (ISO). The organization also prescribed the application of RT-PCR for the detection of targeted viruses including norovirus and HAV in shellfish. In addition, a significant numbers of methods have been reported for the detection of HAV in shellfish; all methods proposed the detection of the virus using RT-PCR with the variation in concentration methods [15, 18, 50] .
