Human CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 which have inhibitory ITIM/ITSM and activating ITAM-like motifs, respectively, in their cytoplasmic regions are such paired receptors. Various bacterial pathogens bind to CEACAM1 on epithelial and immune cells facilitating both entry into the host and down-regulation of the immune response whereas interaction with granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 leads to their uptake and destruction. It is unclear whether paired CEACAM receptors also exist in other vertebrate clades.",

Analysis of genomic sequences of paired receptors provide evidence that their highly similar ligand binding domains were adjusted by recent gene conversion events. In contrast, selection for diversification is observed among inhibitory receptor orthologs of the two frogs which split some 60 million years ago. The allotetraploid X. laevis arose later by hybridization of two closely related species. Interestingly, despite the conservation of the genomic landscape surrounding the homeologous ceacam loci only one locus resembles the one found in X. tropicalis. From the second X. laevis locus more than 80 % of the ceacam genes were lost including 5 of the 6 paired receptor genes. This suggests that once the gene for one of the paired receptors is lost the remaining gene cluster degrades rapidly probably due to lack of selection pressure exerted by pathogens.",

The best investigated families represent the KIR, Ly49, Nkpr, SIGLEC, SIRP and CEACAM families [1] . These so called paired receptors are commonly encoded in the same gene cluster and some are thought to play a role in homeostasis of the immune system by controlling activation and downregulation of immune reactions [2] . Many of the inhibitory members of paired receptors are expressed on natural killer (NK) cells where they sense major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) present on uninfected cells leading to tolerance. Loss of MHC expression frequently found in virus infected cells releases NK cell inhibition with concomitant destruction of the infected cells. Activating members of paired receptors seem to have evolved to counter common virus immune escape mechanisms in serving as decoy receptors on NK cells.",

A number of bacterial pathogens like pathogenic Neisseria (N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitis) Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis have been shown to bind to the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) variable-like domain of CEACAM1 on epithelial and immune cells allowing both entry into the host by transcytosis and downregulation of the host's immune response by inhibiting adaptive and innate immune reactions [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Pathogens thus exploit the normal physiological function of CEA-CAM1 which acts as an immune inhibitory receptor on leukocytes upon homotypic or heterotypic interactions for example with other CEACAM members [7, 12] . In contrast, binding to granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 leads to uptake and destruction of these pathogens by triggering bactericidal processes [13] [14] [15] [16] . Interestingly, phylogenetically unrelated adhesins such as opacityassociated (Opa) protein, outer membrane protein P5 and ubiquitous surface protein (UspA1) mediate interaction with the pathogen receptor CEACAM1 indicating convergent evolution [17] [18] [19] .",

Indeed, clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae from male urethra and female genital tract often express Opa proteins which bind to CEA-CAM1 but not to CEACAM3 [20] . The capability of Neisseria to randomly switch on expression of variant Opas from a panel of Opa genes aides natural selection from a heterogenous Neisseria population. On the other hand, individuals with variant CEACAM1 receptors with low or no binding to pathogens should have an selective advantage. This will inevitably lead to poorly matched paired receptors and loss of decoy function. Intrachromosomal recombination or gene conversion between exons encoding ligand-binding domains of inhibitory and activation receptors within the CEACAM gene cluster could correct this deficit. Indeed, replacement of part of CEACAM3 exon 2 encoding the ligand-binding domain with sequences from the corresponding exon of CEACAM1 has happened in humans [3, 21] .",

Also more distantly related CEACAM genes exist in mammals (CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20) which do not represent paired receptors. They are clustered distally from the CEACAM1-related genes. They differ in domain organization and sequence among each other and exhibit specialized functions [25] [26] [27] .

Here we present comprehensive analyses of the ceacam families of two clawed frog species; the western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis and the African clawed frog X. laevis the ancestors of which split some 60 million years ago [30] . We identified two distantly related ceacam families which both contain rapidly evolving paired receptors.

Interestingly, two ceacam gene loci exist in X. laevis on the homeologous chromosomes 7 L and 7S generated during speciation by hybridization of closely related species ( Fig. 1 ; for nomenclature see [31] ). Amino acid sequence comparison of the N-terminal IgV-like domains (N domains) revealed the presence of two distantly related subgroups group 1 and group 2 in both species (Fig. 2) . N domains were chosen because they represent functionally important domains which have been shown in other species to be responsible for ligand binding [32] . Group 1 and group 2 genes are localized in clusters next to each other and, different from mammals, are not disrupted by non-ceacam genes (Fig. 1) . Group 1 and group 2 Ceacam N domain amino acid sequences are most closely related to cartilaginous and bony fish and reptile and mammalian CEACAM N domain sequences, respectively (~35 % identity). Within subgroup 1 and 2, members exhibit between 40 and 93 % N exon amino acid sequence identity, while between subgroups only 20-30 % sequence identity is observed (data not shown). Similarly, transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences also exhibit a higher degree of identity within groups than between groups (Additional file 1 and data not shown).

To identify orthologous Ceacam pairs as well as Ceacam paralogs, X. tropicalis and X. laevis group 1 and group 2 amino acid sequences from mature N domains (signal peptide sequence removed) were compared and their relationship displayed as dendrograms. In group 1 and group 2, two and seven pairs of orthologous Ceacams, respectively, could be identified based on their degree of sequence identity (Fig. 3) . Their predicted domain organization is heterogenous. Three members consist of only one IgV-like domain and are either secreted or membrane-bound by a transmembrane domain or a GPI anchor while two transmembrane-bound orthologous pairs are composed of one IgV-and one IgC-like domain and an ITAM-containing cytoplasmic region (Fig. 4) .

Pairs of cell surface proteins with similar extracellular domains which are able to interact with the same ligand, however, transmitting opposing i.e. inhibitory or activating signals represent so called paired receptors.

In other paired receptor gene families this is often achieved by recombination or gene conversion between genes encoding inhibitory and activating receptors, restricted to the gene region encoding the ligand binding domains [33] . We, therefore, screened the potential Xenopus paired receptor genes for recombination/gene conversion events. Indeed, in X. tropicalis group 1 ceacam301 and ceacam303 and in group 2 ceacam350 and ceacam351/ceacam368 N exons have recently undergone gene conversion which is exactly Fig. 3 Orthologous and paralogous members of the Ceacam family in X. tropicalis and X. laevis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on mature N domain amino acid sequences (signal peptides excluded) from X. tropicalis and X. laevis group 1 (a) and group 2 Ceacams (b) using the Maximum Likelihood method (MEGA6 software). The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the protein sequences clustered together is shown next to the branches. For Ceacams predicted to contain more than one N domain, only the most N-terminal N1 domains were included in the analysis. Ceacams whose N domains exhibit the highest degree of identity within the same species (paralogs) are boxed with red and blue lines for X. tropicalis and X. laevis, respectively. Pairs consisting of most closely related proteins from different species (sometimes including recently generated paralogs) are highlighted in gray (orthologs). The names of ITIM-containing members are highlighted in red, proteins with ITAM and ITAM-like motifs are marked with green and blue background, respectively. P, pseudogene; Xla, X. laevis; Xtr, X. tropicalis restricted to the exon just including the splice consensus sequences. This is supported by the high conservation of N exon sequences with virtual absence of synonymous mutations (which in general do not encounter purifying selection) and very low sequence conservation in the flanking introns ( Fig. 5a , b, c; Additional file 5). No other genomic regions seem to have been involved in the gene conversion event in ceacam301 and ceacam303 (Fig. 5b) . Recombination events were also noticed in N domain exons of other putative paired receptor gene pairs. This was evident from the lack or low rate accumulation of synonymous mutations mostly restricted to certain regions of the N exons of receptor pairs like ceacam325 and ceacam328 and possibly of ceacam389 and ceacam387 in X. laevis and ceacam350 and ceacam368 in X. tropicalis (Fig. 5d-f ). Without recurrent recombination/gene conversion events between paralogous genes one would expect a steady accumulation of synonymous nucleotide changes along the N exons as it is found between X. tropicalis and X. laevis ceacam orthologs, like ceacam362 and ceacam380 (Fig. 5g) . Interestingly, possibly due to continued pressure from pathogen adhesinreceptor interaction, regions which represent putative interaction sites (the CC'C\"FG face of the Ig fold [35] ) appear to rapidly accumulate non-synonymous mutations occurring after a gene conversion event ( Fig. 5c-f ). For intrachromosomal recombination/gene conversion to take place, involved genes must exhibit opposite transcriptional orientation in order that homologous sequences can be aligned with looping out of the intervening sequences [3, 36] . Indeed, putative paired receptor genes in X. laevis and X. tropicalis from both ceacam subgroups exhibit opposite transcriptional orientation with group 1 and group 2 ITIMencoding genes facing each other (Fig. 1) . The non-random transcriptional orientation of ceacam genes encoding proteins with inhibitory or activating signaling motifs, gene conversion within exons encoding ligand binding domains as well as the conservation of these domains in ITIM and ITAM-containing Ceacams strongly argue that these Ceacams function as paired receptors.",

In addition, both copies of all homeologous genes exhibit similar dN/dS ratios when compared with the X. tropicalis orthologs (Fig. 6a ). Therefore, both homeologous copies of ceacam390.L/390.S and the non-ceacam genes seem to be functional and under selective pressure. In contrast, much higher dN/dS ratios between 0.6 and 0.75 are observed for the remaining ceacam genes, indicating either lack of selection for conservation of the homeologous pairs or selection for diversity. The latter appears to be at work for the inhibitory receptorencoding genes ceacam389.L/389.S which exhibit the highest dN/dS ratios (Fig. 6a, b) . In addition, regions with increased accumulation of non-synonymous mutations In cases of recent gene duplication of one of the orthologs in X. tropicalis or X. laevis dN/dS ratios for all orthologous pairs were calculated and plotted as mean and deviation or standard deviation.

The ceacam gene family consists of two distantly related subgroups (group 1 and group 2) with 15-20 members each. Only few orthologous ceacam members (mostly in group 2) were found in the two frog species. The Xenopus ceacam genes are arranged in one cluster separated by subgroups uninterrupted by non-ceacam genes (Fig. 1 ). This is also observed for most of the CEACAM genes in the marsupial opossum (Monodelphis domestica) but not in eutherian mammals. Here, the CEACAM locus is interrupted by two large regions with non-CEACAM genes ( Fig. 1; [3] ). This indicates that a continuous ceacam gene cluster was also present in the last common ancestor of amphibians and mammals. No CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEA-CAM20 genes, which are well conserved in mammals and are clustered next to BCL3, were found in Xenopus [3] . However, CEACAM19 orthologs can be identified unequivocally in reptiles including turtles, snakes, alligators and gecko but not the other genes ( [29] ; Zimmermann, unpublished results). Interestingly, group 2 Xenopus ceacam genes which are also located next to bcl3 but not group 1 genes are most closely related to reptilian CEA-CAM19 (32-37 % identity) representing the most common hits outside of the anuran order when Xenopus Ceacam group 2 N exon amino acid sequences are used as query sequences. This might indicate that CEACAM19 in reptiles and mammals and group 2 ceacam genes share a common ancestor.",

Both diversification of pathogen receptors to avoid binding of the pathogen (indicated by high dN/dS ratios) and maintenance of similarity of the pathogen adhesin-interacting domain in paired receptors functioning as pathogen or decoy receptors will be selected for in a pathogen/host arms race [1, 34, 37] . Indeed this is observed in both Xenopus Ceacam groups. The exons encoding the ligand-binding domains of X. tropicalis and X. laevis ITIM-containing orthologs exhibit the highest dN/dS ratios which is indicative of positive selection (Fig. 6a) protein domain are expected to reside at the site of contact between the pathogen adhesin and its receptor [37] . This seems to be the case for putative Ceacam pathogen receptor orthologs in X. tropicalis and X. laevis which show selective accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in the CC'C\" FG face of the IgV-like domain (Fig. 7a-c) responsible for pathogen interaction [35] . In contrast, the Ig \u03b2-sheet on the opposite side of the Ig fold is highly conserved. This recurrent host escape and pathogen adaptation (\"Red Queen\" scenario [38] ) can lead to an imbalance with pathogen binding to the entry/inhibitory receptor being maintained while the decoy receptor-pathogen interaction is abolished [20] . This problem can be resolved through recombination/ gene conversion whereby the decoy receptor pathogen binding domain is replaced by that of the pathogen receptor. Absence of synonymous mutations in large regions of the N exons revealed by comparison of the putative pathogen receptor and decoy receptor sequences suggest intra-or interchromosomal recombination or gene conversion events as cause of the similarity of paired receptor ligand binding domains (Fig. 5c-e) . Original sequence identity is rapidly lost due to the on-going struggle between host and pathogens again noted by the selective accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in the presumed adhesin binding regions (Fig. 5c-e) .",

            "text": "Although we do not know which specific pathogens bind to to Ceacam receptors in Xenopus the presence of closely related paired receptors as well as selection for diversification suggests that also in amphibians CEACAM1-related inhibitory proteins still are or have been exploited in the past as pathogen receptors and similar defense strategies have been developed in amphibians and mammals by convergent evolution. Thus the CEACAM family is a prototype gene family which offers a unique opportunity to study \"arms races\" caused by host/pathogen interactions. CEACAM1-related pathogen receptors serve a dual role: They allow both entry into the host and inhibition of inflammatory responses to pathogen infections. Therefore, CEACAM1-like receptors are expected to be expressed on epithelial surfaces as well as on leukocytes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Decoy receptors should be expressed on cells of the innate immune system which allow uptake and destruction of pathogens. The identification and characterization of individual members of the Xenopus ceacam gene families will now allow to use next generation sequencing data of RNA from multiple organs and cell types of Xenopus species as well as genomic sequence data of additional frog species like that of Nanorana parkeri a member of the species-rich Neobatrachia, which contains the vast majority of amphibian taxa (Sun et al., 2015) to support the suggested pathogen defence function of anuran ceacam families.",

For identification of ceacam genes regions syntenic to mammalian CEACAM loci were analyzed for the presence of Ig domain-encoding genes. The following databases were used for ceacam gene identification and loci analyses: Xenbase X. laevis J-Strain 9.1 and X. tropicalis Nigerian 9.0 (http://www.xenbase.org/entry/) and Ensemble X. tropicalis JGI 4.2 (http://www.ensembl.org/Xenopus_tropicalis/Info/Index). Xenopus genomes were reprobed with exon sequences from newly discovered ceacam genes. For estimation of the number of ceacam genes present in a given species, distinct ceacam N domain exons with a sequence divergence > 1 % were counted. Multiple N exons with no annotated non-N exon in between were considered to belong to the same gene. Genes that contained stop codons within their N domain exons or lacked appropriate splice acceptor and donor sites were considered to represent pseudogenes. Genes were assigned to their respective ceacam subgroups 1 and 2 based on phylogenetic analyses. Due to their non-orthologous relationship with mammalian CEACAM genes the new ceacam genes were numbered independently as follows: X. tropicalis, group 1: ceacam301-ceacam321; X. tropicalis, group 2: ceacam350-ceacam375; X. laevis, group 1; ceacam325-ceacam342; X. laevis, group 2: ceacam376-ceacam390. Nucleotide sequences from the N domain exons can be used as gene identifier (Additional files 2 and 3). Gene Nomenclature Guidelines recommended by Xenopus Gene Nomenclature Committee (2013) was followed (http://www.xenbase.org/gene/static/ geneNomenclature.jsp).",

The applied Maximum Likelihood method is based on the JTT matrixbased model [42] . The trees with the highest log likelihood are depicted. The percentage of trees in which the protein sequences clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. In order to determine the selective pressure on the maintenance of the nucleotide sequences, the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN) and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) were determined for N domain exons. The dN/dS ratios as well as the cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along coding regions of N domain exons from paralogous and orthologous genes were calculated after manual editing of sequence gaps or insertions guided by the amino acid sequences using the SNAP program (Synonymous Nonsynonymous Analysis Program; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html). The program Pip-Maker (http://bio.cse.psu.edu/) was used to identify conserved contiguous stretches of nucleotides between gene pairs and to calculate the degree of identity which is summarized as a 'percent identity plot' [43] . Multiple amino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW programs (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/ npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_clustalw.html).",

Intra-and inter-group 1 and group 2 Ceacam member alignments are shown. The amino acids in one letter code are colored according to their relatedness: red, identical; green, highly similar properties; blue, similar properties. Gaps indicate exon borders, dashes missing amino acids. The names of the cytoplasmic domain-encoding exons and the intron types (0, xxx-intron-xxx; 1, x-intron-xx; 2, xx-intron-x; xxx = codon) are indicated above and below the aligned sequences. ITIM (I/L/V/ SxYxxL/V), ITSM (TxYxxV/I), ITAM (D/ExxYxxL/Ix 6-8 YxxL/I) and endocytic or ITAM-like motifs (YxxL/M/V/I/F) are marked by red, orange, green and blue boxes, respectively. Note the characteristic split of the YxxL motif in the ITAM and ITAM-like motifs by phase 0 introns. GRB2-like Src homology 2 (SH2) domains-binding motifs (YxNx) are boxed with magenta lines. Note their conservation in most ITAM/ITAM-like motif-containing Ceacams at presumably non-homologous positions in group 1 and group 2. The small letter x represents any amino acid, and slashes separate alternative amino acids that may occupy a given position. An additional motif (TEHKS) highly conserved in mammals and shown to bind beta-catenin is shaded gray [44] .

Only Ceacams whose complete domain organization could be delineated were included. Homeologous Ceacams in X. laevis arisen by hybridization during speciation are discriminated by L (encoded on long chromosome variant 7) and S (encoded on short chromosome variant 7). For comparison the domain organization of human CEACAM proteins is shown. The conserved human CEACAM family members are highlighted in green.

The predicted signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic domains are schematically shown as green (ITAM), blue (ITAM-like motif), red (ITIM) and yellow boxes (ITSM). Transmembrane domains and GPI anchors are indicated by black and green lines, respectively. Orthologous relationship as suggested by sequence relatedness and/or synteny is indicated by gray boxes.

(c-f) The accumulation of nonsynonymous (green curves) and synonymous substitutions (red curves) along the N exons of putative paired receptor genes were determined after manual removal of gaps in the compared nucleotide sequences. The type of encoded signaling motif is indicated by the color of the gene name: red, ITIM/ITSM; green, ITAM; blue, ITAM-like motif. Stretches of codons with no or minimal accumulation of synonymous substitutions which run parallel to the x-axis suggest recent gene conversion/recombination events. Note the rapid accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the CC'C\"FG \u03b2-strand regions (black broken lines) which indicates selection for diversification. This contrasts with conserved regions indicated by red broken lines. For comparison, N exon sequences of an orthologous gene pair (Xtr ceacam362/Xla ceacam380) were analyzed (g). The location of CC'C\"and FG \u03b2-strand regions determined by 3D modeling (Additional file 4) are indicated by gray boxes above the graphs.
