We estimated the country-specific EF and its 95% UI (Table B) based on Undurraga et al (4) , who derived EFs through a systematic analysis of published studies that reported original, empirically derived EFs or the necessary data to obtain them (3) . For countries where no empirical studies were available, data were extrapolated based on the statistically significant inverse relationship between an index of a country's health system quality and its observed reporting rate. Based on previous evidence, we assumed that the apparent illness ( ) represents approximately 20% (SD 10%) of all dengue infections (5, 6) .

First, the monthly incidence rates for countries in SEA and China were de-trended by subtracting fitted values from the observed values by a linear model, and centred (discounted the mean) and reduced (divided by the SD) to z scores to increase cross-country comparability. Then, the continuous wavelet transforms with the complex Morlet wave using a nondimensional frequency \u03c90 = 6 and a periodicity step size \u03b4 j of 0.25 on a linear scale were conducted for each country to enable the extraction of a high resolution of the periodicity scale (1-mo intervals) and obtain phase angles to represent epidemic timing (7) (8) (9) . Finally, we measured wavelet coherency between dengue transmission time series in SEA and dengue importation time series from SEA into China. The wavelet coherency uses wave transforms of two time-series to indicate their localized phase relationship in a timefrequency spectrum. Statistical significance of wavelet coherency was tested using Monte Carlo methods (n = 600) (7, 10) .",

These itineraries included data on the initial airports of embarkation in SEA and all direct and non-direct flight connections up to the travelers' final airport destination in China. Previous studies suggested that residents in endemic countries and travelers from non-endemic countries into endemic areas might have various risks of mosquito-borne infections, due to the duration of stay, immunity, and locations, etc. (1). To delineate the potential different risks of dengue infection in SEA and importation from SEA into China by local residents of SEA and Chinese travelers returning from SEA between 2005 and 2015, we estimated the monthly volume of Chinese travelers ( , , ) and SEA residents ( , ,",

For all Chinese travelers and SEA residents traveling into China, the risks of DENV importation from an endemic country s into a location i of China in month m were estimated as As the mean intrinsic incubation period for DENV is approximately 6 days and the infectious period post-onset is 3-5 days (13), we assumed D is 10 days (SD 1 day) in this model. For the Chinese population, , , is ~1 because the average duration of stay for Chinese residents in other countries is approximately 7 days, so virtually all Chinese travelers are expected to return to China within one month. For the local population in SEA, , , is the number of local SEA residents travelling to China divided by the total population of the respective country. To estimate the , and , , we first estimated the total number of person days for Chinese travelers ( , ) and locals ( , ) in SEA as , = \ufffd , , , = , -\ufffd , , where , , and , , are the numbers of Chinese travelers and local travelers respectively, is the number of days in each month, , is the total yearly population of each country. C is the duration of stay in SEA for Chinese or in China for residents from SEA, parameterized as 7 days (SD 1 day) based on the statistics from the China National Tourism Administration. We then estimated daily prevalence of DENV infection in this combined population as , is the number of dengue cases adjusted by underreporting in country s and month m. Given the high dengue burden and ecological suitability of vectors in SEA (14, 15), we assumed that travelers and locals had equal exposure risk in SEA and that travelers from/to other locations (not between s and i) in a country of SEA just replaced each other. Based on the daily risk of being infected estimated above, and the total person days of Chinese travelers and residents in SEA, the probability of travel, and the immunity of travelers, , , and , , can be further derived as the proportions of susceptible population in Chinese and SEA travelers, respectively, to adjust for population immunity. As the average yearly incidence rate of dengue reported in China between 1990 and 2014 was only 2.2 cases per one million residents (16), we assumed all Chinese travelers were susceptive to dengue viruses from 2005 to 2015 (~1). Given the high force of infection in the nine study countries, new infections are concentrated among children (who presumably travel less) and most adults are immune for at least one serotype of DENV (6), we then assumed that the susceptible proportion, , for SEA travelers was 20% (SD 10%).",

The mean and 95% UI of the estimates of infected travelers, by Chinese and SEA residents, were computed using the distributions of importation risk from all 10,000 parameter sets, and the estimates were compared with the number of imported cases reported in China. Quantifying Introduced transmission risk The monthly probability (p AUTO ) of an introduced DENV infection from SEA leading to autochthonous transmission in China was defined as the probability in a three-step process: (1) infected airline travelers from each SEA country entering provinces or cities in China; (2) mosquitoes in China acquiring the virus from infected travelers; and (3) those infected mosquitoes infecting at least one other person in China (11, 12).
