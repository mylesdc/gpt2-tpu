According to previous deletion analyses, M self-assembly involves multiple M sequence regions. To identify important M amino acid residues for VLP assembly, we coexpressed N with multiple M mutants containing substitution mutations at the amino-terminal ectodomain, carboxyl-terminal endodomain, or transmembrane segments.",

Results from cross-linking VLP analyses suggest that the cysteine residues 63, 85 and 158 are not in close proximity to the M dimer interface. We noted a significant reduction in M secretion due to serine replacement for C158, but not for C63 or C85. Further analysis suggests that C158 is involved in M-N interaction. In addition to mutations of the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, substitutions at codons W19, W57, P58, W91, Y94 or F95 all resulted in significantly reduced VLP yields, largely due to defective M secretion. VLP production was not significantly affected by a tryptophan replacement of Y94 or F95 or a phenylalanine replacement of W19, W57 or W91. Combined, these results indicate the involvement of specific M amino acids during SARS-CoV virus assembly, and suggest that aromatic residue retention at specific positions is critical for M function in terms of directing virus assembly.",

            "text": "The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected individuals in 30 countries in 2002 and 2003 [1] . Its causative agent was identified as a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2, 3] that was initially classified as part of a separate coronavirus group [4, 5, 6, 7] , but is now described as a betacoronavirus [8] . As with most coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) [4, 9] . Mature coronavirus particle assembly involves protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. M, the most abundant structural protein [10] , is thought to play a central role in directing virus assembly and budding via interaction with E, S and N [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . Translated on free polysomes, N is associated with newly synthesized viral genomic RNA to form helical nucleocapsids [19] . The M membrane glycoprotein is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to Golgi complexes [20, 21] . M interacts with nucleocapsids on the cell membranes of ER or Golgi complexes [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] . In a similar manner, S and E proteins are translated on membrane-bound polysomes, inserted into the ER, and transported to Golgi complexes, where E and M interact and trigger virion budding with enclosed nucleocapsids [14, 19] . S is incorporated into virions via interactions with M. Virions accumulate in large, smooth-walled vesicles that are exocytotically released from cells [4] .",

Results from our tests to determine whether cysteine residues play a role in SARS-CoV VLP assembly indicate that a serine substitution at C63 or C85, or a combined C63/85S double-mutation, did not significantly affect VLP assembly and release ( Fig. 2A , lanes 11, 12 and 14) . In contrast, single or combined double or triple substitutions of cysteine residues involving C158 markedly affected VLP production, likely a result of reduced M secretion. Note that secreted M mutants carrying the C158S mutation are glycosylated form-deficient ( Fig. 2A upper panel, lanes 13, 15 and 16), suggesting an M-C158S maturation defect via the classical secretory pathway (54) . As a control, N expressed by itself was not released into medium (Fig. 2B, lane 8 ). An HA tagged at the M amino-terminus (HA-M) had no major effect on M release and N packaging; in contrast, a FLAG tagged at the M carboxyl terminus (M-FLAG) significantly affected N incorporation (Fig. 2B, lane 11 ). This is consistent with previously reported results [41] . We found that N coexpression slightly increased wt or secretion-competent M mutant release, but had little effect on the release of secretion-defective mutants. This observation does not alter our conclusion that N release or VLP production depends on the presence of secretion-competent M proteins. Since M+N VLP assembly is determined by M release capacity, we determined the mutational effects on M release capacity under N coexpression conditions. The results shown in Figure 2A suggest that C158 is necessary for SARS-CoV M selfassembly or release.",

As shown in Figure 2C , we noted a band of approximately 110 kDa corresponding to the Pr55gag dimer (lane 4, arrowhead), which is consistent with an earlier report that cysteine residues in the Pr55gag interaction (I) domain are capable of cross-linking via BMH [42] .

Results from further analysis indicate that either the F95L or S110G mutation significantly affected M secretion and VLP production (data not shown). Since the S110 mutation is located in the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, it is not surprising that S110G impaired VLP assembly. When analyzing the impacts of a F95L mutation, we found that an alanine substitution for F95 significantly impaired VLP assembly, but a tryptophan substitution did not (details given below). This indication of an important VLP assembly role for the conserved aromatic residue at codon 95 served as our motivation to investigate similar roles for the nearby residues W91 and Y94two conserved aromatic residues that co-reside with F95 in the third transmembrane domain. We also created alanine and leucine substitutions for W57, which is located in the second transmembrane domain (Fig. 1) . P58, which is conserved and located next to W57, was changed into alanine because both tryptophan and proline may play a role in protein-protein interaction [43, 44] . Based on one research team's proposal that the dileucine motif is involved in sorting and trafficking [45] , we replaced two dileucine motifs located in the carboxyl-terminal (L218-L219) region with alanine. Based on past results suggesting that the M self-association domain is largely located among 50 amino-terminal residues [41] , we changed an amino-terminal dileucine motif (L15-L16) and the W19 conserved aromatic residue into alanines to determine whether they are involved in VLP assembly.",

Alanine or leucine changes in W19 ( 4A, lanes 13) . We have tried to find an adequate explanation for this observation. It may be that the released chimeric vesicles contain greater amounts of F95L than of HA-M or M-FLAG due to favorable F95L incorporation. We observed that in the presence of M-FLAG or HA-M, immature unglycosylated forms of W91A, Y94A and F95L were more abundant in medium than their glycosylated counterparts, while F95A had a greater abundance of the unglycosylated form in medium when coexpressed with HA-M (Fig. 4A , lanes 10-13, lower vs. upper arrowheads). This is likely evidence of preferential association between HA-M or M-FLAG and immature unglycosylated mutant forms. Combined, these results suggest that some secretion-defective mutants can be rescued into wt M particles via M-M interaction.",

N, wt or mutant M was coexpressed with GST-N (a GST fused to the N amino-terminus) and subjected to GST-pull down assays. Since N contains a dimerization domain, N association with GST-N was used as a control [48, 49] . As expected, N was efficiently pulled down by GST-N. With the exception of C158S, all of the tested secretion-defective M mutants were co-pulled down with GST-N (Fig. 6) , suggesting that M mutants are still capable of N association despite being defective in terms of cell release. Unexpectedly, 218LL/AA and M-FLAG were efficiently pulled down by GST-N (Fig. 6C, lanes 11 and 12) . Similar results were obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-N antibody (Fig. 6D) . Levels of Nassociated M-C158S, as determined by GST pull-down or coimmunoprecipitation assays, were lower compared to those of the other mutants used in this study (Fig. 6C, lane 10 and Fig. 6D, lane  8) . These data suggest that the C158S mutation significantly affected M-N interaction, and that the 218LL/AA and M-FLAG mutations at the M carboxyl-terminal tail prevented N from viral incorporation during M-directed virion morphogenesis, even though they did not significantly affect M-N interaction.",

Intracytoplasmic vesicles containing VLPs were also observed (Fig. 7A, arrowheads) . Further, we noted VLPs near the nuclei of cells coexpressing N and secretion-defective W91A (Fig. 7D ). VLPs were also detectable in cells coexpressing N and Y94A, F95L or P58A M mutants (Figs. 7E-7I). Figure 5 shows culture supernatants collected from cotransfectants 24 or 48 h post-transfection. At 24 h, spherical particles approximately 100 nm in diameter were observed in wt M and N cotransfectant samples (Fig. 7J) , which is consistent with previous results. In contrast, VLPs from cells coexpressing N and P58A were undetectable or barely detectable until 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 7K) . Also at 24 h post-transfection, medium samples containing P58A plus N cotransfectants were almost identical to the mock-transfected sample-that is, we detected some vesicles, but no VLPs (Fig. 7L) . VLPs were barely detectable in culture supernatants derived from cells expressing N plus W91A, Y94A, F95L/A, C158S or 218LL/AA.

This observation may be due to different expression systems used in the two studies. It could be that 293T cells release and/or express SARS-CoV membrane proteins more efficiently than Vero E6 cells. This may partly explain why 293T cells produce VLP-associated spike (S) proteins at levels 28-fold higher than Vero E6 cells, as reported by Siu et al. [40] .

            "text": "The inability of the 218LL/AA or M-FLAG mutant to package N suggests that the M carboxyl-terminal tail domain is responsible for M-N interaction. At least three research teams have suggested that the coronavirus M carboxyl tail region is important for N association [26, 47, 50] . However, our GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiment results suggest that alanine substitutions for the highly conserved dileucine motif 218-LL-219 failed to significantly impact SARS-CoV M-N interaction; this finding agrees with data from yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays [47] . Nal et al. [54] have proposed that SARS-CoV M recycles to Golgi complexes via endocytosis once it reaches the plasma membrane. Accordingly, substitution mutations at 218-LL-219, or a FLAG tagged at the carboxyl-terminus, may block M sorting or trafficking to the Golgi area, resulting in defective VLP formation. This scenario may partly explain why M-FLAG and 218LL/AA were capable of N association following the disruption of cellular compartments.",

MHV VLP formation is dependent on coexpression with the E protein [10, 52] . Accordingly, impaired MHV VLP assembly due to a M carboxyl-terminal mutation is largely the result of a defect in M-E interaction [52] , whereas SARS-CoV M carboxylterminal mutations such as 218LL/AA and M-FLAG do not affect M self-assembly and release. In a previous study we observed that SARS-CoV E is also secretable into culture medium (unpublished results); this is in agreement with a report that levels of SARS-CoV VLPs formed by M plus N noticeably increased following E coexpression [40] . However, E coexpression did not significantly enhance the VLP yields of SARS-CoV M mutants (data not shown), suggesting that E is incapable of compensating for M mutants in terms of directing VLP assembly.",

            "text": "With the exception of C158, we found that all of the identified amino acid residues deemed important for SARS-CoV M selfassembly were either proline or aromatic (e.g., tryptophan, phenylalanine or tyrosine). Aromatic residues have been shown to mediate the self-assembly of different soluble proteins via ,pi.-,pi. interactions between polar aromatic rings [55, 56, 57] . Aromatic side chains have been proposed as favoring intra-and inter-peptide electrostatic interaction contributing to protein secondary structure and stable protein-protein interaction [58] . One research team has demonstrated that an aromatic-X-Xaromatic motif located in the transmembrane (TM) domain of EpsM (a cholera toxin secretion protein) is essential for stabilizing TM dimerization [59] . It is likely that the SARS-CoV M aromatic-XX-aromatic motif (91-WXXY-94), which resides in the predictive second TM domain, serves a similar function in stabilizing M dimerization. In addition, a more recent study suggests that coronavirus M is capable of adopting two conformations associated with membrane curvature regulation [53] . Accordingly, the replacement of conserved aromatic residues with alanine or leucine may disrupt M conversion from one form to another, resulting in a membrane-bending defect. This scenario may partly account for decreased mutant VLP yields.",

P58 replacement with alanine also resulted in markedly impaired VLP assembly(Fig. 3C, lane 10). Our finding of detectable P58A-associated N in medium was likely due, at least in part, to longer immunoblot exposure (Fig. 3Clower panel, lane 10). Note that a phenylalanine replacement for W19, W57 or W91, or a tryptophan substitution for Y94 or F95 did not significantly impact VLP assembly (Fig. 3A, line 15; Fig. 3B, lanes 14, 15 and 18; Fig. 3C, lane 9). These data suggest that the retention of an aromatic amino acid residue at M codons 19, 57, 91, 94 or 95 is critical for SARS-CoV VLP assembly. Secretion-defective M Mutants are Still Capable of Selfassociation or Association with wt M Since M-M interaction involves multiple M sequence regions, we predicted that secretion-defective mutants associated with wt M would be released into medium. To test this idea, we coexpressed each of the secretion-defective mutants with M-FLAG or HA-M. W91A, Y94A and F95L release levels were noticeably increased following M-FLAG or HA-M coexpression (Fig. 4A, lanes 10, 11 and 13). Although W19A was barely detectable in medium with coexpressed M-FLAG, HA-M coexpression resulted in readily detectable W19A in medium (Fig. 4A, lane 9), possibly due in part to more efficient association with HA-M than with M-FLAG. Note the higher level of F95L compared to M-FLAG and HA-M in medium when F95L was coexpressed with M-FLAG or HA-M (Fig.",
