In acute settings, the pericardium does not have time to increase its compliance, leading to a rapid decline in cardiac output.",

[6] [7] [8] One study identified the most common diagnoses of patients with pericardial effusions as follows: acute idiopathic pericarditis (20%), iatrogenic cause (16%), malignancy (13%), chronic idiopathic effusion (9%), acute myocardial infarction (8%), end stage renal disease (6%), and tuberculosis or bacterial infection (4%). 4, 9 The clinical presentation of cardiac tamponade can vary widely. Acute presentations of tamponade can occur Advocate Christ Medical Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Oak Lawn, Illinois within minutes or hours, as is typically seen in trauma, aortic rupture, or iatrogenic result from an invasive procedure. Acute presentations frequently result in life-threatening hypotension necessitating immediate interventions to decrease the pericardial pressure. 10 In contrast, the subacute presentations can occur over days to weeks and hypotension is relatively uncommon. 4, 11 One study demonstrated that 27-43% of patients presenting with subacute cardiac tamponade are actually hypertensive, with systolic blood pressures ranging from 127 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) to 144 mmHg, likely secondary to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. 11, 12 Clinical findings of tamponade can vary, and no sensitive or specific signs have been identified. 13 Findings may include tachycardia, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, tachypnea, hypotension, hypertension, and pericardial rub. The classic presentation of Beck's triad, characterized by hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds, is seen only in a small number of acute cardiac tamponade cases. 14 When considering cardiac tamponade in patients, the diagnostic workup should include an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and echocardiogram. While tamponade is mostly a clinical diagnosis, echocardiography is highly recommended by multiple task forces and societies. 13, 15 If available in the emergency department (ED), point-of-care ultrasound should be used by emergency physicians to help identify and possibly treat acute cardiac tamponade.",

            "text": "Echocardiography has a class I recommendation to evaluate most pericardial diseases as it can identify anatomic, physiologic, and hemodynamic abnormalities of the heart. 15 When evaluating for pericardial effusions, this imaging modality can estimate the size and location of the effusion. Effusions can be classified based on quantitative measurements: small <10 mm, moderate 10-20 mm, and large >20 mm in size. 13 Echocardiographic signs of tamponade include collapsing cardiac chambers, changes in chamber volumes and flows with respiration, and inferior venous cava dilation. 13 While any heart chambers may collapse in tamponade, the most common findings are right-sided atrial and ventricular collapse, and studies have demonstrated that right atrial collapse is highly sensitive and specific for tamponade if it persists for longer than one-third of the cardiac cycle. 15 Collapse of the right ventricle is less sensitive than right atrial collapse, but very specific for tamponade. 16 This patient was treated by a cardiothoracic surgeon who performed a pericardial window to remove the pericardial fluid. Most patients with cardiac tamponade require drainage of the effusion to improve symptoms. The two methods of removal include percutaneous drainage by a pericardiocentesis and surgical drainage by creating a pericardial window (pericardiectomy). While each method has its advantages, our patient underwent surgical pericardiectomy. This procedure allows the clinician to obtain pericardial biopsies for further evaluation, which was an important consideration in this patient given her history of recurrent effusions. For our patient, analysis of the fluid and subsequent rheumatologic and malignant workups were negative. Interestingly, the patient tested negative for the most common etiologies of tamponade. Upon discharge, a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of reaccumulation of a pericardial effusion.",

While there are many known causes of cardiac tamponade, our patient had a completely negative workup. This case illustrates the importance for emergency physicians to always consider the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade when encountering patients with severe hypotension and tachycardia. Without prompt and proper identification of this diagnosis, patients have a high likelihood of experiencing severe morbidity and possibly mortality. Immediate point-of-care cardiac ultrasound and transthoracic echocardiography can aid in the diagnosis. In conclusion, we report a unique presentation of severe cardiac tamponade that developed within a 24-hour interval period and was successfully treated with a pericardial window.",
