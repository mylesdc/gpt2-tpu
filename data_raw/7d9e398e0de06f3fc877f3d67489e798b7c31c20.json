            "text": "Background: Pertussis causes severe disease in young unvaccinated infants, with preterms potentially at highest risk. We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history. Methods: Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005-2014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., <37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington. Results: Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional oxygen, and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93-96%) and 73% (95% CI 20-91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively). Conclusions: Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.",

            "text": "Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection, caused mainly by Bordetella pertussis and less frequently by Bordetella parapertussis [1] . In the pre-vaccination era, infants and children contracted pertussis in their first years of life, with a clinical course characterized by uncontrollable coughing attacks, often accompanied by paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, and inspiratory whooping. Consistently high vaccination coverage has substantially decreased pertussis in the population [2, 3] , but newborns too young to be vaccinated remain at high risk for severe complications including apnea, cyanosis, pneumonia, encephalopathy or even death [4] . This risk is increasing due to the worldwide pertussis reemergence in the 1990s, even in areas of high vaccination coverage in all age groups, with transmission of disease from household members to newborns. Today, high pertussis incidences in infants are observed, with incidence peaking every two to three years [3, 5, 6] . Worldwide in 2014, an estimated 24 million cases and 160,000 deaths from pertussis occurred in children younger than 5 years, with the African region contributing the greatest share [7] . In the Netherlands, each year approximately 150-180 children <2y are hospitalized and one infant, in general too young to be vaccinated, dies due to pertussis [8] . For this reason, many countries are discussing prenatal pertussis vaccination of mothers to protect newborns, and a growing number of countries now recommend it [9] . This measure is effective in preventing pertussis in the first months of life and has decreased the pertussis disease burden in young infants [10, 11] . In the Netherlands, the Health Council advised that 3rd trimester maternal pertussis vaccination be offered. This is overall very effective in prevention of pertussis in early infancy, but preterms may benefit less due to a smaller timewindow for mother-to-child transfer of antibodies before delivery [12, 13] . However, vaccine effectiveness (VE) is reportedly lower after 2nd trimester pertussis vaccination [14] . Given the introduction of a maternal vaccination strategy against pertussis in The Netherlands, we sought to gain more insight into the current pertussis burden among hospitalized infants, with special attention to preterms.",

            "text": "This medical record study on infant pertussis hospitalizations showed an overrepresentation of preterms, who accounted for 12% of all pertussis hospitalizations while comprising, on average, 8% of Dutch birth cohorts [21] . Furthermore, preterms were older than terms at hospitalization and had more often received their first pertussis vaccinations. Effectiveness of this first dose was significantly lower for preterms than for terms. Moreover, preterms tended to need more often intensive treatment and had a longer ICU stay. Likewise, preterms tended to be diagnosed more often with coinfections. Despite lower VE, the first vaccination against pertussis reduced disease severity and the need for intensive treatment in both groups. Coinfections and age at admission influenced the need for intensive treatment and mitigated the beneficial effect of pertussis vaccination.",

In Norway, 10% of infant pertussis hospitalizations concerned preterms, compared to 5% born prematurely nationwide [22] . Similar data are derived from England [13] , Australia [23] , and Canada [24] . Low birth weight (LBW), which is associated with preterm delivery, was increased among hospitalized pertussis cases in Jerusalem [25] . Likewise, Langkamp et al. showed that LBW infants were at increased risk of pertussis hospitalizations compared to those of normal birth weight [26] . Winter et al. reported that LBW and low GA were associated with increased risk of fatal pertussis [4] . The clinical picture in our observational study resembles findings in other retrospective studies. Marshall et al. showed that preterms had a higher pertussis disease severity score (defined by a longer hospital stay, ICU admittance, need for rehydration, respiratory support, coinfections, and the presence of complications) than terms [23] . In England, a longer duration of hospitalization and higher frequencies of ICU admittance and coinfections were observed among preterms, although their frequency of coinfections was lower than we found (10% vs 37%) [13] .Langkamp et al. reported a higher median age at hospitalization and a longer median length of stay among LBW infants than among those of normal birth weight [26] .",

The fact that the Scandinavian countries saw no difference in VE between term and preterms might be explained by the interplay between maternal antibodies that reduce a first response and an immune response that is ineffective in preterms at age 2 months but may have improved by age 3 months [41] . For the 2nd dose, we found no VE difference between terms and preterms. As in other studies, we found that the effect of vaccination on the clinical course was influenced by coinfections [13, 23] , which included viral infections like RSV [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .

Results might have been influenced by the incomplete reporting of hospital diagnoses at discharge, assessed in a recent capture-recapture analysis [8] . We could not stratify this underreporting by GA, but the good representation of tertiary, top clinical, and local hospitals in our study probably led to inclusion of a representative variety in the spectrum of pertussis disease. This conclusion is underlined by our finding that preterms are overrepresented, as found by other studies.",

Our sensitivity analysis showed no major impact of missing data on GA, thereby confirming our findings. A breakdown of preterms into smaller groups based on GA would be clinically relevant, but low numbers prohibited this analysis. Likewise, WBCs and CRP data were incomplete, also leading to less informative results.",

The Dutch Health Council recommended maternal pertussis vaccination in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. While this strategy is overall very effective, preterms may benefit less due to less protective maternal antibody transfer before delivery [12, 13] . They probably will benefit more from 2nd trimester immunization. Especially for infants born of unvaccinated mothers, a timely first post-natal dose remains important, as it greatly reduces cases of pertussis and decreases disease severity. Our study underlines the need for more in-depth surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases in relation to GA and more insight into optimizing the vaccination program for all children but in particular for preterms, the most vulnerable group.",
