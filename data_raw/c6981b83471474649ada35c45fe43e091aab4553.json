            "text": "Epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.",

Temporal trends in an EWS were used as a method of distinguishing between an emerging disease (R 0 approaching 1) and a stationary disease (constant R 0 ). We investigated the robustness of EWS to reporting process parameters, namely the aggregation period, reporting probability and overdispersion of reporting error. Seven of ten EWS perform well for realistic reporting scenarios, and are strong candidates for incorporation in disease emergence monitoring systems.",

Combined, they can make each pathogen's emergence seem idiosyncratic. In spite of this apparent particularity, there is a recent literature on the possibility of anticipating epidemic transitions using model-independent metrics [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Referred to as early-warning signals (EWS), these metrics are summary statistics (e.g. the variance and autocorrelation) which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. In addition to infectious disease transmission, EWS have been investigated for transitions in a broad range of dynamical systems, including ecosystem collapse and climate change [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The motivation for EWS comes from the theories of dynamical systems and stochastic processes, in particular the slowing down that universally occurs in the vicinity of dynamical critical points [22] [23] [24] . Theoretical results for disease emergence are promising, and suggest that the transition from limited stuttering chains of transmission (R 0 < 1) to sustained transmission and outbreaks (R 0 > 1) is preceded by detectable EWS [8, 13, 14] .",

Theoretical predictions assume the data will be sequential recordings (or \"snapshots\") of the true number of infected in the population through time [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In this paper we refer to this as snapshots data. However, epidemiological data originate instead from notifications by public health practitioners whenever a new case is identified. Public health bodies aggregate individual cases into regular case reports (e.g. the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report), as shown in Fig 1. Different combinations of serial interval (difference in time of symptom onset between primary and secondary cases) and aggregation period lead to time series which have very different appearances. Even assuming perfect reporting, variability in both the incubation period and onset of clinical symptoms mean that snapshots data cannot be reconstructed from case report data. In addition to aggregation, case reports are subject to reporting error (see Fig 2) . Underreporting may occur due to asymptomatic infection, poorly implemented notification protocols, or sociopolitical factors [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Misdiagnoses and clerical errors in the compilation of reports can result in both under-and over-reporting [30] [31] [32] . Due to self reporting and contact tracing, once an index case has been positively identified secondary cases are more likely to be diagnosed, which may lead to clustering in case reports. The combination of case aggregation and reporting error results in a mismatch between snapshots and imperfect epidemiological data. EWS, such as the variance (Fig 3, top panel) , are affected by imperfect data (Fig 3, bottom panel) and may not display the characteristic trends that form the basis for detecting disease emergence. This provides reason to question the direct application of EWS to observed data.",

We simulated a stochastic SIR model of a pathogen emerging daily snapshots of the number of infected present in the population (black), weekly case reports (blue) and monthly case reports (red). For the purposes of this paper, the number of recovery events falling within an aggregation period serves as a proxy for the true number of cases in a case report. Aggregation periods are delimited by blue dots for weekly reports and red dashes for monthly reports. No reporting error is applied to the case reports shown in this figure. Transmission dynamics are modeled using the SIR model with birth and death with average population size N 0 = 10 6 , importation rate z = 1 case per week, mean life expectancy of 70 years, and mean infectious period of 1 week. R 0 increases linearly from 0 to 1 over 20 years. Simulations performed using the Gillespie algorithm [33] . via increasing R 0 , and corrupted the simulated case reports by applying a negative binomial reporting error. The area under the curve (AUC) statistic was computed to quantify how well trends in an EWS identify emergence. We find that performance depends on both the EWS and the reporting model. Broadly, the mean, variance, index of dispersion and first differenced variance perform well. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well unless either i) the data are highly overdispersed or ii) the aggregation period is less than the infectious period. The coefficient of variation, kurtosis, and skewness have a more subtle dependence on the reporting model, and are not reliable. We conclude that seven of ten EWS perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios.",

The model compartments and parameters are listed in Table 1 . Transition rates and effects are listed in Table 2 . The basic reproductive number for the SIR model is R 0 (t) = \u03b2(t)/(\u03b3+ \u03b1), where \u03b2(t) varies due to nondescript secular trends in the transmissibility. Simulated data are generated using the Gillespie algorithm [33] , which simulates a sequence of transition events (infection, recovery, birth and death), and returns the number of individuals in each model compartment through time. The SIR simulations are of a population with average size N 0 = 10 6 . The parameter z gives the rate at which new cases arise due to external sources, and is set to z = 1 per week. The death rate, \u03b1, is the reciprocal of the life expectancy, set to 70 years. Case counts, C t , are given by the number of recovery events (at rate \u03b3I t ) within each aggregation period, and are included in the model as an additional variable (see Table 1 ). Weekly case report data from the US CDC's MMWR compiled and released by Project Tycho [34] . Estimates for measles reporting efficacy in the USA are around 45% [27, 35, 36] In addition to the raw weekly case reports, the bottom row shows the data aggregated into bi-weekly and four-weekly reports. Changing the aggregation period changes not only the values of the variance (top row), but also the trend, quantified using Kendall's \u03c4. Only data to the left of the shaded area are included in calculating the variance. The moving average is calculated using a two year window, i.e bandwidth b = 52 for weekly reports; b = 26 for bi-weekly; b = 13 for four-weekly. For details see the Methods section. Reporting error is applied to the case count at the end of each aggregation period by sampling a negative binomial distribution,",

As R 0 approaches 1, the mean number of cases caused by introductions rises, making it a potential EWS. The index of dispersion is a similar measure to the coefficient of variation, and is defined as the variance to mean ratio. The decay time (or correlation time) is a log-transform of the autocorrelation, which diverges as R 0 approaches 1 (the definition of critical slowing down). In addition to the autocorrelation, which is normalized by the variance, we consider the unnormalized autocovariance. As both the autocorrelation and variance increase, the autocovariance may outperform these two measures. Theoretical results show the increase in variance accelerates as R 0 approaches 1, suggesting the first differenced variance as a complementary EWS.

The BDI process is a one-dimensional stochastic process, depending only on the number of infected I t , and possesses an exact mathematical solution (for full details see [13] ). This allows expressions for the moments and correlation functions of I t to be found ( Table 3 , fourth column). BDI theory predicts that most EWS (the mean, variance, index of dispersion, autocovariance, decay time and first differenced variance) are expected to grow hyperbolically as R 0 approaches one. The autocorrelation is expected to grow exponentially, the kurtosis quadratically and the skewness linearly. The coefficient of variation is the only EWS which does not grow, instead remaining constant. We propose observing these trends in data as a basis for anticipating disease emergence.

The focus of this paper is to examine the robustness of each EWS to reporting process parameters, using simulated case report data, K t . BDI theory predicts that 9 out of 10 EWS increase as the transition is approached. We quantify the association of each EWS with time using Kendall's rank correlation coefficient [19] . A coefficient close to (+/\u2212)1 implies consistent increases/decreases of the EWS in time. As the underlying dynamics of the case reports are stochastic, the value of the rank correlation coefficient is itself a random variable. Multiple simulations of the test (emerging) and null (stationary/not emerging) scenarios result in two distributions of correlation coefficients for each EWS. We measure performance using the AUC statistic, defined as the overlap of the two distributions, and may be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen test coefficient is higher than a randomly chosen null coefficient, AUC = P(\u03c4 test > \u03c4 null ) [39, 40] . The name comes from one method of calculating it, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a parametric plot of the false positive rate against true positive rate as the decision threshold is varied [41] . Instead of explicitly calculating the ROC curve, the AUC can be efficiently calculated after ranking the combined set of test and null correlation coefficients by value [40] , ",

However, epidemiological data are typically aggregated into periodic case reports subject to reporting error. To examine the practical consequences of this mismatch between theory and data, in this paper we calculated EWS from case report data. We performed extensive numerical simulations to determine the sensitivity of each candidate EWS to imperfect data. Case aggregation and reporting error change the statistical properties of the data, and can have subtle effects on an EWS's performance. We identified four groups of EWS based on their sensitivity to the various reporting process parameters. The performance of one group, consisting of the EWS with either polynomial or no growth with R 0 , has a nuanced relationship with the reporting process parameters. We therefore conclude that the coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness perform poorly as EWS. In general, the other EWS (the mean, variance, first differenced variance, index of dispersion, autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time) all performed well and are strong candidates for incorporation in monitoring systems intended to provide early warning of disease emergence.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, the combination of reporting error and aggregation of data does not always have a detrimental effect on EWS performance. The coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness perform best when both reporting probability and overdispersion are low. At first glance this result appears counter-intuitive: as an increasingly large fraction of cases are missed, performance improves. The point to stress here is that by changing the parameters of the reporting process we are systematically changing the statistical properties of the time series. For instance, the BDI process predicts no trend in the coefficient of variation, due to the standard deviation and mean increasing with R 0 at an identical rate [13] . With aggregation and reporting error this identity does not necessarily hold, introducing a trend in the coefficient of variation and improving its performance. To fully explain this phenomenon requires an analytical solution for the statistics of K t , which requires solving the stochastic process including aggregation and reporting error. However, it can be seen to be plausible if we focus only on stochasticity resulting from reporting error. For low overdispersion (e.g. \u03d5 = 100), the reporting probability distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = \u03c1C t . Ignoring demographic stochasticity, we replace C t with E[C t ] = \u03b7\u03b4(1 \u2212 R 0 ) \u22121 . Both the coefficient of variation and skewness for this distribution are \u03bb \u22121/2 = {(1\u2212R 0 )/\u03c1\u03b7\u03b4} 1/2 and the kurtosis is \u03bb \u22121 = (\u03c1\u03b7\u03b4) \u22121 (1 \u2212 R 0 ). These two expressions both decrease as R 0 increases from 0 to 1, consistent with the experimentally observed AUC < 0.5. The improved performance at low \u03c1 is a consequence of the increased stochasticity in reporting outweighing demographic stochasticity. Can these EWS be used to anticipate disease emergence? If overdispersion and reporting probability are known to be low, then yes. However, it is unlikely that the reporting process is sufficiently understood for an emerging disease. We conclude that these three EWS are unreliable and therefore not good indicators of emergence.",

Therefore increasing reporting overdispersion (i.e increasing \u03d5 \u22121 ) amplifies the response of \u03c3 2 /\u03bc to changes in R 0 . This leads to a greater differential, improving performance of the index of dispersion as an EWS. However, increased reporting overdispersion also implies increased volatility of data within a finite sized window, which reduces reliability.

The negative binomial distribution is meant to provide a stringent test on EWS performance, and the parameter ranges are conservative (especially for overdispersion). For instance, if there are 10 actual cases in a week, and reporting error is negative binomially distributed with \u03c1 = 0.1 and \u03d5 = 0.01, then the mean number of reported cases is 1. However, the probability of no cases being reported is P(K = 0) = 0.955 whereas the variance in reported cases is \u03c3 2 = 101. The resulting time series is highly volatile, with little similarity in appearance to the underlying time series of actual cases. It is unlikely that case reports for an emerging disease will have such high overdispersion. In addition, for a highly pathogenic emerging disease, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or H7N9 avian influenza, the reporting probability is likely much higher than \u03c1 = 1/256 (the smallest value we studied). Nonetheless, one of the encouraging findings of this study is that high reporting is not essential for reliable early warning. Clear trends in the EWS can still be identified, provided there are sufficiently many introductions for cases to be sporadically detected prior to emergence. These dynamics are typical for a reemerging vaccine controllable disease, such as measles, where cases are continually introduced into disease-free regions from endemic regions [45, 46] .",

If this is not the case, there is a smaller probability that successive links in a chain of transmission fall into neighboring case reports. We speculate that this reduces the impact of fluctuations in a particular report on the subsequent report, diminishing their correlation. This effect is exacerbated if the reporting probability is low. A more rigorous explanation requires a full solution to the stochastic process with aggregation and reporting error. For many known pathogens the serial interval is larger than one week, for example measles virus and Bordetella pertussis [47] . For other pathogens it is less than one week, such as SARS coronavirus [48] and influenza virus [47, 49] . In order for the autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time to be reliable EWS, our results suggest the data need to be aggregated by periods larger than the serial interval. The performance boost outweighs costs associated with having fewer data points. We expect that these three EWS will work best for pathogens with short serial intervals; for pathogens with extremely long serial intervals (such as HIV) reliable use of these EWS is unlikely.",

As shown in Table 3 , both the mean and the variance scale with the introduction rate, which is a product of the per capita introduction rate and the susceptible population size. On the other hand, the index of dispersion, autocorrelation and decay time are all independent of introduction rate.

One challenge to early-warning stems from the potential suddenness of novel pathogen emergence, for example SARS was unknown prior to the global outbreak in 2002-2003. For known pathogens, intermittent data availability presents a separate challenge. Mumps was excluded from the US CDC's MMWR in 2002 following a period of low incidence. Subsequently, there was a series of large outbreaks, notably in 2006 in the Midwest, and mumps was reincluded. Methods such as EWS are contingent on surveillance efforts being maintained.",

Case reports sometimes include additional metadata, for example whether all suspected cases are counted or only clinically confirmed cases. The reporting error of case reports with differing case identification criteria is expected to be very different, as has been seen for instance with MERS [50] . This paper shows that EWS depend on the reporting process, and cross-validating EWS calculated from each data stream could improve performance. Provided it is available, how to leverage metadata is a promising avenue for future research into enhancing EWS.",

Our findings further reinforce the hypothesis that disease emergence is preceded by detectable EWS. While epidemiological factors preclude early-warning for certain pathogens, for example Ebola virus (estimates of R 0 have consistently been greater than one [51] ) and HIV (see above), they do not rule out many others, including reemerging childhood diseases [52] , H7N9 avian influenza virus [53] , and MERS coronavirus [54] . These pathogens all present public health risk, and EWS may be able to play an important role in monitoring for their emergence.",

Reporting error is modeled using a negative binomial distribution with \u03c1 = 0.25 and \u03d5 = 0.1. The high overdispersion (small \u03d5) means that there is little visual correspondence between the number of case reports with and without reporting error. Additionally, the number of case reports can exceed the true number of cases (overreporting), in spite of the low reporting rate. SIR simulations performed using the same parameters asFig 1.",
