In this paper, both the panel data model and the contingent valuation method (CVM) approaches are applied. The empirical results indicate that the number of death from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 0.226% as the variation in temperature increases by 1%. More importantly, the number of death from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 1.2% to 4.1% under alternative IPCC climate change scenarios. The results from the CVM approach show that each person would be willing to pay US$51 to US$97 per year in order to avoid the increase in the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases caused by climate change.",

For instance, Saez et al. [2] , Shen et al. [3] , Donaldson et al. [4] , and Rey et al. [5] have tried to estimate the relationship between the mortality rate and temperature. They found that the most suitable temperature (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate) is around 19 degrees Celsius and it may vary in different regions. This implies that extreme low-and high-temperature levels combined with variations in temperature will directly affect human life. In spite of this important observation, however, very few studies have tried to estimate the economic impacts of climate change on human health, especially in relation to cardiovascular diseases. To fill the knowledge gap in this field, this study adopted an econometric approach to quantify the effects of various climatic variables on cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the contingent valuation method (CVM) is used to evaluate the economic impacts of climate change on human health. Please note that the cardiovascular diseases considered in this study include Essential Hypertension, Hypertension Heart Disease, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Angina Pectoris, and Acute But Ill-Defined Cerebrovascular Disease.",

Changes in blood pressure, blood viscosity, and heart rate associated with physiological adjustments to cold and warmth, however, may explain the temperature-induced increase in mortality due to diseases of the cardiovascular system [6] . Therefore, the risk of death will be substantially increased if the changes of temperature exceed the limits that the cardiovascular system can withstand. Such increases in mortality from cardiovascular diseases may result from changes in blood pressure, blood viscosity, and heart rate associated with physiological adjustments to cold and warmth [6] .",

[8] appraised the cardiovascular disease mortality rate during the winter season in Russia, and found that the mortality rate increases when the average daily temperature is below zero degrees Celsius. Basu and Samet [9] used a time series approach to estimate how the mortality rate is affected by heat waves, found that the mortality rate increases due to the increase in the duration and intensity of heat waves. Alf\u00e9 sio et al. [7] found that the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease increases when there are extremely high or low temperatures. However, Basu and Samet [9] also pointed out that urban pollution is a principal factor explaining deaths based on the relationship between human health and climate change. Ebi et al. [10] found that the variations in climate due to the ENSO phenomenon may help explain the increase in cardiovascular disease in hospital populations. All these studies have shown that human health is significantly affected by the level of and variation in climate-related variables. This implies that the level and variation in temperature are the two major factors affecting the mortality related to cardiovascular diseases.",

The annual average temperature during the 1960s was about 22.8 degrees Celsius, but it has increased to 24.0 degrees Celsius during the first decade of the 21st century. The historical trends of the average temperature, the temperature variation, and the number of cold days along with the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan during the period from 1991 to 2006 are shown in Figures 1 to 3. Figure 1 reveals that both the average temperature and the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases exhibit seasonal cycles. It also shows that the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases tends to increase (decrease) as the average temperature decreases (increases). This implies that there may exist a negative relationship between the average temperature and the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases. As presented in Figure 2 , we observe that higher numbers of deaths from cardiovascular diseases are generally associated with higher temperature variations during winter months. Therefore, increases in the temperature variation could potentially cause more people died from cardiovascular diseases. Besides, we find that the number of cold days could also affect the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases as shown in Figure 3 . In Taiwan, the number of cold days in a month is defined as the number of days with the lowest temperature less than 12 degrees Celsius. As more cold days occur in a month, people with cardiovascular diseases will have a higher risk of mortality. Although Figures 1 to 3 have provided strong evidence of a significant relationship between climatic conditions and the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases, the magnitude of such effects needs to be further investigated to provide meaningful data to clarify the policy implications for the government.

The estimation outcomes with the combinations of alternative climate change scenarios are adopted in the second step. To determine the effects on mortality of thermal stress in relation to cardiovascular diseases due to changes in climatic conditions, both the possible climatic conditions and socio-economic factors need to be specified.

Data sets for 13 regions based on the administration system in Taiwan were collected. The combined dataset is consisted of monthly data from January 1971 to December 2006 for each region. Therefore, there are 432 monthly observation data for 13 regions included in our balanced panel model. The basic descriptive statistics for each variable are presented in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that the monthly number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases in a region ranges from 0 to 271 persons with an average of about 55 persons. This implies that the level of the mortality rate varies significantly between different months. Levels and variations of climate conditions as well as seasons may contribute such an unsteady phenomenon. The average monthly temperature is about 23.38 degrees Celsius, which seems to be favorable for human beings, however, the minimum average temperature occasionally falls down to 13 degrees Celsius and the maximum at times reaches up to 31 degrees Celsius. This significant difference in terms of average monthly temperature may affect the numbers of people in Taiwan suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

Several important findings can be drawn from the estimation outcomes. The first finding is that the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will decrease if the average monthly temperature (ATTEMP) goes up, which is consistent with the findings of Keatinge and Donaldson [1] . They concluded that the global warming will reduce the number of deaths from heart disease. The estimated parameter indicates that the percentage of the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will decrease by 0.231% if the average temperature increases by 1%. However, the estimated cross effect of the seasonal dummy variable and the average temperature shows that the effect of a 1% decrease of average monthly temperature on the mortality of cardiovascular disease in the winter season will be 0.132% higher than that in the other seasons. The positive sign of seasonal dummy variable indicates that the mortality of cardiovascular disease is more sensitive during winter seasons.",

Our empirical results indicate that the effect of the average monthly temperature on the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is more profound than those of the other climate variables. As a result, the estimated parameter can be used to calculate the effects of climate change on the mortality of cardiovascular diseases for alternative climate change scenarios on temperature. The climate change scenarios are retrieved directly from IPCC's 2007 Report [13] which includes scenarios B1, B2, A1B, and A2 at year 2100. Among the four scenarios, B1 and B2 are more optimistic scenarios while A1B and A2 are more pessimistic scenarios. The best estimated temperature rise is 1.8 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.1 to 2.9 \u00b0C for scenario B1, while the best estimated temperature rise is 2.4 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.4 to 3.8 \u00b0C for scenario B2. For the two pessimistic scenarios A1B and A2, the best estimated temperature rise are 2.8 \u00b0C (ranging from 1.7 to 4.4 \u00b0C ) and 3.4 \u00b0C (ranging form 2.0 to 5.4 \u00b0C ), respectively. Based on IPCC's estimation of global climate sensitivity and a case study on the projected climate change in Taiwan by Hsu and Chen [12] , the temperature variation increase in Taiwan due to climate change was simulated to be within the range of 5% to 16%. The estimated effect of temperature variations on the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is 0.235% for the winter season and 0.448% for the other seasons when the temperature variation increases by 1%. Therefore, the combination of these two numbers could be used to estimate the possible percentage increase in the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases due to climate change. In this study, we adopted the lowest value (1.2%) and the middle value (4.1%) of the estimated range to evaluate the economic impacts of climate change on cardiovascular diseases. 10.389 Note: The numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations while * denotes statistical significance at the 10% level, ** represents the 5% significance level, and *** represents the 1% significance level.",

This implies that an economic assessment of climate change induced health threat to human beings is also very important in view of the decision-making involved in public health investments to mitigate the damage caused by such diseases. To estimate the economic impacts of climate change on cardiovascular diseases, the contingent valuation method (CVM) approach is applied in this paper. The survey-based contingent valuation method is used to look into the willingness to pay (WTP) of respondents in a particular region or country. For public health agencies, the information regarding WTP for a reduced exposure to the health threat is often needed to acquire funding to cover the administrative costs of surveillance and reporting as well as the costs of the scientific development in disease control.",

Since then, this method has been widely applied to cases of non-market goods including on ecological, environment, recreation, and health areas. The CVM allows one to elicit from individuals a definite indication of their preferences when it is difficult to observe this behavior in an existing market. Furthermore, the estimated results could lead to compensated measurements of welfare, which are expressed in monetary values. The CVM employs specific surveys designed on the basis of the need to induce respondents to reveal their WTP for the object being evaluated. Its principle consists of confronting individuals with a hypothetical market in which non-market goods are traded. Then, the respondents are asked to disclose their preferences for the goods traded by means of a bidding process (Tseng et al. [11] ).",

The correct predicted percentage is calculated based on the number of correct predicted samples divided by the total sample size. A high correct predicted percentage implies a high validity of the model. The empirical results are presented in Table 5 . In terms of the signs of the estimated parameters, the results confirm what we expected in Table 4 . The estimates for cases 1 and 2 are consistent with each other in terms of the signs and the statistical significance of the parameters. The results reveal that income appears to have an important influence on WTP. Besides, the results indicate many variables have significant positive effects on WTP including the respondents' sense of the climate change (WARM), the variation in temperature (VARTEMP), the respondents' sense with respect to climate change on the environment (ENVIRONMENT), whether the respondent already suffers from cardiovascular diseases (EFFECTED), risk behaviors (RVALUE), and age (AGE). On the contrary, only the health check (CHECK) and prevention behavior (PREVENT) have significant negative effects on WTP. The results also suggest that sex, marriage, education and the number of family members are not significant variables. It is worth noting that respondents with health insurance have relatively higher WTP than those without health insurance. Knowledge of the mortality from cardiovascular diseases has significant positive effects in Case 2, but it does not have significant effects in Case 1.",

There are two meanings attached to these figures. The first interpretation is that the economic damage from cardiovascular diseases due to climate change ranges from NT$1,685 to NT$3,212 per year per person. Therefore, for the entire society, the total economic damage ranges from NT$29.16 to NT$55.59 billion (or US$0.88 to US$1.68 billion) per year.

[11] estimated the effects of climate change on dengue fever, an infectious disease in Taiwan, and found that the respondents' WTP to avoid the increasing probability of dengue fever by climate change ranged from US$0.52 to US$3.67 billion. As another extreme example, Liu et al. [18] estimated the WTP to reduce the risk of infection and death from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan and found that the values per statistical life ranged from 3 to 12 million US dollars. Their WTP estimates are higher than those of Tseng et al. [11] and this study because of the higher mortality rate associated with SARS. Comparing with other diseases such as the food-borne diseases Campylobacteriosis or Salmonellosis, Goldberg and Roosen [19] applied CVM and found that an individual's WTP ranged from US$2.98 for a risk reduction of 40% for Campylobacteriosis or Salmonellosis to US$5.88 for a risk reduction of 80% for Salmonellosis and a risk reduction of 40% for Campylobacteriosis. Sauerborn et al. [20] found that people would be willing to pay US$2.58 to US$3.78 for a vaccine against maternal malaria in Burkina Faso. A couple of studies also provide WTP estimates for noninfectious diseases. Kleinman et al. [21] found that respondents would be willing to pay up to US$181.66 to obtain a complete relief in a short period of time without the side effects of Gastroesophageal Reflux, while Johnson et al. [22] found that respondents would be willing to pay $1,510 over three years to participate in a program to prevent the onset of diabetes. All of the studies mentioned above indicate that the respondents' WTP depends on the types of diseases, the mortality rate, as well as the country surveyed. We found our estimation values to be within the middle range of these estimates.

We found that the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases would increase by a range of 1.2% to 4.1% with respect to alternative climate change scenarios. The CVM is also applied to estimate the economic impacts of climate change on cardiovascular diseases. The respondent's WTP is investigated in the survey using the payment card approach. The results show that each person would be willing to pay US$51 to US$97 per year (or a total of US$880 million to US$1,680 million for the whole public) in order to avoid 1.2% to 4.1% increase in the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases caused by climate change.",
