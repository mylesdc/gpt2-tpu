Isolation was performed with the FK81 cell line, and the virus was identified by PCR, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the phylogenetic analysis of the partial thymidine kinase (TK) and glycoprotein B (gB) genes. A total of 253 bp of the TK gene and 566 bp of the gB gene were amplified from the trachea of the tiger by PCR/RT-PCR method. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate belonged to the same cluster with other FHV-1 strains obtained from GenBank. Herpes-like viruses with an envelope and diameters of approximately 200 nm were observed in the culture supernatants of FK81 cells inoculated with samples from the tiger. The FHV-1 infection was confirmed by an animal challenge experiment in a cat model.",

This infection is often fatal to kittens, but adult cats usually survive and exhibit lifelong latency [2, 3] . Since the first strain of FHV-1 was isolated in America, infected felids have been reported in many countries, including Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Holland, Hungary and Japan [4] . There have been no documented reports on FHV-1 in the past few years, although the distribution in China was confirmed by serological survey and virus isolation in domestic cats [5] .",

The AGE (agarose gel electrophoresis) results showed that a target fragment of 292 bp in length was amplified by PCR/RT-PCR, from DNA/RNA extracted from trachea samples of the dead tiger [7] .

A 253 bp sequence was obtained, and alignment analysis determined that the TK gene cloned in this study shared a high identity (from 99% to 100%) with that of other FHV-1 isolates (Figure 1) . A 566 bp fragment of the gB (glycoprotein B) gene was also cloned, and was found to share 100% identity with that of other FHV-1 isolates. Therefore, its phylogenetic tree was omitted here. The two sequences have been deposited in Genbank whose accession numbers are ** and **, for TK gene and gB gene fragment separately. The phylogenetic tree based on the TK gene sequences showed that the isolate investigated in this study, was closely related to the ten isolates of FHV-1 ( Figure 2 ), a result consistent with the alignment analysis.",

The FHV-1 described in this study, was isolated from a captive tiger that exhibited respiratory signs that were suspected to be due to rhinotracheitis. By PCR/RT-PCR, the only virus detected in the trachea homogenates was FHV-1, which was confirmed afterwards by virus isolation, the TEM examination of cell cultures showing CPE, and a challenge experiment in cats. Furthermore, the full genome of the virus isolated in cell culture is being sequenced, and the obtained sequences are 90%-100% homologous with that of PCR products either for TK gene or for gB gene. Challenged cats exhibited uniform clinical symptoms and shed FHV-1 virus. Other agents causing respiratory disease were excluded as possible pathogens.",

On its infection, the authors supposed two possible sources. One was that the tiger got the virus in captivity perhaps due to stray cats in the zoo, because FHV-1 was shed in ocular, nasal, and oral secretions, and transmission was primarily by direct contact with an infected cat. The other was an endogenous infection originating from a latent viral infection. As with other alphaherpesviruses, latency is common, and periodic viral reactivation is sometimes associated with the reoccurrence of clinical signs [17] . To validate the first supposition, a retrospective investigation was conducted after the virus isolation and identification. Although negative PCR results were found for the swab samples collected from stray cats and captive leopards and tigers, the contagious source could not be easily obviated. It is very much regrettable that neither prior sera nor post mortem sera were stored enabling the seroconversion analysis, making our second supposition to be theoretic.",

These effects were also observed in two additional continuous cultures. PCR/RT-PCR revealed that the supernatants of all three cultures were positive only for FHV-1. The positive PCR products of TK gene of FHV-1 from trachea homogenates and cell cultures were identified by sequence analysis. The 253 bp sequence of TK gene from FHV-1 from trachea homogenates shared 100% homology with FHV-1 isolates.",
