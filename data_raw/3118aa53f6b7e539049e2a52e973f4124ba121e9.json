In vivo and field trials in different geographic distributions and different host varieties declared that this extract mixture was more efficient than the commercial agent Ningnanmycin with a broad spectrum of anti-plant-viruses activity. No phytotoxic activity was observed in the treated plants and environmental toxicology showed that this new acetone extract was environmentally friendly, indicating that this acetone extract has potential application in the control of plant virus in the future.",

Ningnanmycin is one of the most successfully registered anti-plant viral agent and displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 \u03bcg mL -1 [3] . Ribavirin, another widely used plant viral inhibitor, has lower than 50% inhibitory effects at 500 \u03bcg mL -1 [3] . Lower cure rates (30-60%) and probably negative effects on environments of these antiviral agents limit their wider applications.

No specific permissions were required and no endangered or protected species were involved throughout the tested fields. In these fields, rice was naturally co-infected with Rice stripe virus (RSV) and Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) throughout the year. Twenty days after transplanting, the compounds (the extract mixture and Ningnanmycin) were sprayed twice with an interval of 14 days. Three dosages were used for the acetone mixture at 300, 450 and 600 g ha -1 , compared with 8% Ningnanmycin at 750 g ha -1 . Both of these compounds were diluted with 750 L water per hectare. Water alone was used as negative control. Each experiment was repeated four times and the area of each district was varied from 20-60 m 2 , depending on different geographical locations in the south of China (Tables 1 and 2 ). The survey was carried out following the national standard GB/T 17980. 19-2000 called 'pesticide, guidelines for the field efficacy trials, fungicides against leaf diseases of rice'. In each plot, 50 plants for each of 5 points were selected in a diagonal line. Flag leaf, top second leaf and top third leaf were investigated in each plant and recorded as total leaf number, number of diseased leaves and disease grade. The classification of disease conditions were described as follows. Grade 0: no disease found in the whole plant; Grade 1: percentage of lesion size out of the total leaf area is lower than 1% and the length of lesion length is shorter than 0.3 cm; Grade 3: percentage of lesion size out of the total leaf area is between 2-5% and the lesion length is longer than 0.3 cm; Grade 5: percentage of lesion size out of the total leaf area is between 6-25%. Some lesions connect and are longer than 1 cm; Grade 7: percentage of lesion size out of the total leaf area is between 26-50%. Most of the lesions connect and are longer than 1 cm; Grade 9: percentage of lesion size out of the total leaf area is more than 50%. Lesions connect and large area of the leaf necroses. The disease index and control effects were calculated according to the following formulas. DMRT method was applied to do variance analysis for determining the significance difference between every treatment.",

After sprayed with the acetone extract and 8% Ningnanmycin, disease indexes were much lower than those of control treatment. As the dose of the acetone extract increases from 300 to 600 g ha -1 , disease index gradually decreased and control effect increased. The best antiviral activity was reached at the dose of 600 g ha -1 , which results in better antiviral effect than 8% Ningnanmycin at 750 g ha -1 .

In the form of complex mixture, the bioactive compounds may simultaneously function as antiviral activity, dependently or independently with each other, thus reinforcing the inhibiton effect against viruses. Another advantage of mixture of antiviral agents has been discussed by previous researches. One important challenge for any antiviral drugs is the development of resistance by various viruses. In this case, mixture of antiviral compounds is more efficient and practical than the single ones. Because a virus that has developed resistance to a particular drug may not be resistant to other antiviral compounds, which have the potential to possess similar, if not identical, antiviral activities [31] .",

In this study, no toxicity was found in tobacco or rice plants. And this acetone extract was slightly toxic to Japanese quail, Daphnia magna, Scenedesmus obliquus and Bombyx mori, and moderately toxic to fish and bees. This environment friendly acetone extract holds potential promise for commecial application in the future. Firstly, from economic considerations, the starting material cottonseed is widely available in China and the cost may be very low. Secondly, cottoseed oil sludge rather than cottonseed oil was served as the raw material, which is the precipitation and enrichment of antiviral effective compounds, so that maximum efforts have been made to improve the concentration of active compounds. Most importantly, the in vivo and field trials demonstrated that this acetone extract was broad-spectrum antiviral, not only against different plant virus (TMV, RSV, SRBSDV), but also more effective in different host varieties from different geographic distributions in China, compared with the commecial agent Ningnanmycin.",
