            "text": "Viruses are obligatory intracellular pathogens and completely depend on their hosts for survival and reproduction. The strategies adopted by viruses to exploit host cell processes and to evade host immune systems during infections may differ largely with the type of the viral genetic material. An improved understanding of these viral infection mechanisms is only possible through a better understanding of the pathogen-host interactions (PHIs) that enable viruses to enter into the host cells and manipulate the cellular mechanisms to their own advantage. Experimentally-verified protein-protein interaction (PPI) data of pathogen-host systems only became available at large scale within the last decade. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the current PHI networks belonging to DNA and RNA viruses and their human host, to get insights into the infection strategies used by these viral groups. We investigated the functional properties of human proteins in the PHI networks, to observe and compare the attack strategies of DNA and RNA viruses. We observed that DNA viruses are able to attack both human cellular and metabolic processes simultaneously during infections. On the other hand, RNA viruses preferentially interact with human proteins functioning in specific cellular processes as well as in intracellular transport and localization within the cell. Observing virustargeted human proteins, we propose heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and transporter proteins as potential antiviral therapeutic targets. The observed common and specific infection mechanisms in terms of viral strategies to attack human proteins may provide crucial information for further design of broad and specific next-generation antiviral therapeutics. Viral infections pose ever-increasing danger to the human beings because of emerging and reemerging diseases. Their high mutation rates enable viruses to easily develop drug resistance towards the conventional therapeutics, which mainly inhibit essential viral proteins. This makes the problem more serious, since most of the current antiviral drugs are hardly effective to the resistant virus strains. Therefore, the efforts on the next-generation antiviral drug discovery have been focused on finding host-oriented drug targets, which act on cellular functions essential in the virus life-cycle [1, 2] . The cellular processes are manipulated and exploited by pathogenic microorganisms through mainly physical interactions between pathogen and host proteins [3] . Therefore, viral PHI networks should be investigated thoroughly in terms of the functional properties of virus-targeted host proteins, in order to identify the cellular proteins and associated functions that are indispensable for viruses to replicate and persist within the host cell during infections. The understanding of the differences and similarities in the infection mechanisms used by different viral groups is crucial for designing broad and virus-specific antiviral therapeutics [1, 4, 5] .",

RNA viruses have typically ssRNA, but may also contain dsRNA. ssRNA viruses can be further grouped as positive-sense (ssRNA(+)) or negativesense (ssRNA(\u00c0)). The genetic material of ssRNA(+) viruses is like mRNA and can be directly translated by the host cell. ssRNA(\u00c0) viruses carry RNA that is complementary to mRNA and must be converted to positive-sense RNA using RNA polymerase before translation. An exception of this group is the Retroviruses, which replicate through DNA intermediates using reverse transcriptase despite having RNA genomes.",

They have evolved to develop strategies to manipulate host cell mechanisms to control their own life cycles and also to disable antiviral responses of host immune systems [4, 7, 8] . Compared to DNA virus genomes, which can encode up to hundreds of viral proteins, RNA viruses have smaller genomes that usually encode only a few proteins. Owing to the size and functionality of the resulting proteome, the size and type of viral genetic materials may have great effects on the life styles of viruses within the host cells. DNA viruses have integrated large DNA sequences from the hosts to their genome, throughout the evolution. Consequently, their genomes can encode proteins with eukaryote-originated complex functional domains and enable DNA viruses to finely exploit the metabolism of infected cells in order to promote their own replication within the cell. On the other hand, RNA virus proteins cannot exhibit such homologies with their eukaryotic counterparts, but still can communicate with host cells through complex networks of PHIs. RNA viruses have probably evolved a different strategy, i.e. they interact with the host proteins using protein-binding motifs specific to RNA viruses [9] . Consequently, it can be stated that, DNA and RNA viruses have developed some distinct infection strategies to cause generally chronic and acute infections, respectively.",

These are human proteins targeted by lots of pathogen proteins; and pathogen proteins targeting lots of human proteins. This scale-free behavior is observed in the DNA virus-human PHI network to some extent (Fig. 1A) . On the other hand, in RNA viruses, very few viral proteins have roles in PHI networks because of their very small genomes. All of these RNA virus proteins usually have lots of interactions with human proteins (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, in most cases, the scalefree behavior could not be observed in RNA virushuman PHI networks. In fact, the degree distribution of the virus-human protein interaction networks could not be fitted to any model yet, mostly because of their incompleteness [21] , despite some preliminary attempts to model the graph properties of PHI networks [10] . The distribution of 4943 viruses-targeted human proteins based on their attacking virus types can be observed from the number of proteins in the human protein sets (Table 3) . A considerable amount of human proteins (1354) are targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses, constituting the common viral targets. All of the virus-targeted human proteins with the number of targeting DNA/RNA virus families can be found in Data S3.

Unfortunately, this approach has been ineffective because of drug resistance developed by viruses, especially in the case of RNA viruses which can mutate very rapidly. The next-generation antiviral therapeutics are emerging which target host proteins required by the pathogens, instead of targeting pathogen proteins. If these host factors are indispensable for pathogens, but not essential for host cells, their silencing may effectively inhibit infections without developing drug resistance rapidly [1, 21, 22] . Another alternative approach is to inhibit the interactions between these host factors and pathogen proteins, instead of targeting the proteins [23] . The development of these novel strategic therapeutic approaches against infectious diseases raises the need for enlightening the infection mechanisms through PHIs, in order to identify putative host-oriented anti-infective therapeutic targets. To understand the complex mechanisms of infections, computational analysis of underlying protein interaction networks may serve crucial insights to develop non-conventional solutions [2, 14, 24] . This study of computational analysis of virus-human interactomes aims to provide initial insights on the infection mechanisms of DNA and RNA viruses, comparatively, through the observation of the characteristics of human proteins interacting with viral proteins. The common and special infection strategies of DNA and RNA viruses found here may lead to the development of broad and specific next-generation antiviral therapeutics.",

            "text": "As the main viral infection strategy, all viruses manipulate cellular processes to proliferate within the host. Therefore, viral proteins highly interact with human proteins functioning in cell cycle, human transcription factors to promote viral genetic material transcription, nuclear membrane proteins for transporting viral genetic material across the nuclear membrane, and also regulatory proteins for translation and apoptosis [3, 15, 25, 26] . We identified human proteins that are highly interacting with viral proteins, sequentially based on the total number of targeting virus families ( Table 4 ). The list includes the top viral targets which interact with multiple viral families, within the most comprehensive PHI data. Some of these human proteins were previously reported as targets for multiple viruses, i.e. P53, NPM, ROA2, GBLP, and HNRPK [3, 15] . Our analyses revealed that there are six heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRPs) in the highly targeted human proteins list (HNRPK, ROA1, HNRPC, HNRH1, HNRPF, ROA2). HNRPs are RNA-binding proteins, which function in processing heterogeneous nuclear RNAs into mature mRNAs and in regulating gene expression. Specifically, they take role in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. They also recruit regulatory proteins associated with pathways related to DNA and RNA metabolism [27, 28] . Being targeted by multiple viruses, HNRPU was reported as a hotspot of viral infection, and proposed as a potential antiviral human protein [4] . In the present study, HNRPU is found to be targeted by five viral families (see Data S3). Our data additionally indicate several other HNRPs, targeted by viral proteins (see Data S1-S3). For all virustargeted HNRPs, the number of targeting RNA virus families is found to be higher than that of DNA virus families (see Data S3), revealing that they may play crucial roles in viral RNA processing. The protein family of HNRPs may serve as host-oriented antiviral drug targets. Moreover, our analyses also reflected that proteins functioning in transport and localization related processes within the cell are targeted highly by both DNA and RNA viruses, i.e. IMA1, ADT2, TCPG, and TCPE. IMA1 (Karyopherin alpha 2, KPNA2) functions mainly in nuclear import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1 (Karyopherin beta 1). Interacting with IMA1 enables viruses to enter the nucleus and consequently to use the host's transcriptional machinery. Besides, viruses may interact with IMA1 in order to inhibit the host antiviral response, since nuclear import factors regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory proteins to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response [3, [29] [30] [31] . The transmembrane transporter activity of ADT2 is responsible for the exchange of cytoplasmic ADP with mitochondrial ATP across the mitochondrial membrane, serving crucial roles in metabolic processes [32] . Attacking to human metabolic processes was reported as a common infection strategy of bacteria and viruses [15] . The proteins, TCPG and TCPE are responsible for RNA localization activity and our results reveal that they are targeted by larger number of RNA families (Table 4) . Highly targeted transporter proteins should be investigated further for their potential to be next-generation antiviral target, because of their crucial roles in viral life cycle within the host organism.",

YBOX1 functions in transcription of numerous genes, as a transcription factor. It also contributes to the regulation of translation. On the other hand, P53 is the famous tumor supressor acting as an activator for apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis is a very crucial process during the viral infection progress, and should be strategically controlled by viruses for a successful viral infection. Apoptosis is an innate immune response to viral infection. In the early stage of viral life cycle in the host cell, apoptosis is inhibited by corresponding virus-human protein interactions. After completion of transcription and translation of viral genetic material, viruses try to induce apoptosis to assist virus dissemination [37] [38] [39] .",

Additionally, GO and pathway terms are widely used as features in computational PHI prediction studies [44, 45] . Our observation of the enriched GO process terms for human proteins targeted by only DNA viruses (Table 5 ) may lead to the conclusion that DNA viruses have specifically evolved to be able to attack human cellular and metabolic processes simultaneously, during infections. Using this PHI mechanism, DNA viruses can finely exploit the cellular and metabolic mechanisms of infected cells to their own advantage, generally resulting in chronic infections in human. On the other hand, GO process terms enriched in human proteins targeted by only RNA viruses are mostly related to RNA processing, intracellular transport and localization within the cell (Table 5 ). It was reported that RNA viruses extensively target human proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism and also protein and RNA transport to promote viral RNA processing for a successful infection [4] .",

The most highly-targeted human process is translational elongation. Translational control of viral gene expression in eukaryotic hosts was reported repeatedly [46] [47] [48] . Here, we presented translational elongation as the top GO process term enriched in human proteins targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses within the current experimental PHI data. The remaining list includes cellular and metabolic processes, which can be considered as targets of both virus types. Based on these observations, we can state that the common viral infection strategy is to target human proteins functioning within the processes of gene expression and protein synthesis, simply because of the lack of their own such machineries. All viruses depend on the cellular mechanisms for these processes and they recruit host ribosomes for translation of viral proteins. A comparative investigation of the enriched pathway terms for human protein sets targeted by only DNA viruses and by only RNA viruses (Table 8 ) reveals additional support for the different infection strategies of these viral groups. There is no common term in these two lists of enriched human pathways. Cell cycle pathway targeted by only DNA viruses and RNA-related pathways targeted by only RNA viruses, provide parallel results with GO enrichment analyses. The enriched pathway terms in 4-DNA viruses-targeted human protein set are only Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and viral carcinogenesis ( Table 9 ). EBV is a species of DNA virus family Herpesviridae, which constitute nearly half of the DNA viruseshuman PHI data (Table 1) . On the other hand, it is estimated that 15% of all human tumors are caused by viruses, mainly DNA viruses, i.e. Herpesviruses and Papillomaviruses [49] . The pathway enrichment analysis of 4-RNA viruses-targeted set brings the terms of protein processing and immune system related terms forward (Table 9 ). Finally, for the common targets of two virus types, we obtained ribosome term enriched with a very small P-value (Table 10 ). Both viruses use host ribosome for viral protein synthesis.",
