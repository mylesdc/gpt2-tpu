The results indicated a reduced risk of death among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 patients compared to other influenza A strains, with an adjusted risk ratio of 0\u00b725 (95% confidence interval 0\u00b708-0\u00b775, P = 0\u00b701), while no significant differences were found between the lengths of stay in the hospital for these two groups.

However, the process of linking datasets that have not been designed with this objective in mind can be complex, as there is not always a consistent unique identifier that can be used to match a record from one database to a corresponding record for the same patient (or encounter, depending on the purpose), in another database. Data structures often differ, requiring multiple entries to be matched to a single row in another database, and completeness of key linking fields is not always prioritized in data entry.",

Previous studies have indicated that factors such as pregnancy, immunosuppression and neurological disorders [13] , are related to severe infection and would therefore be important to consider. Bacterial co-infections have also been associated with fatal cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection [14] , a finding that could be assessed through linkage with other routinely collected hospital laboratory data, although full reviews of clinical notes would be required to provide a complete understanding of the pre-existing medical conditions. Second, the mortality outcome was calculated using only the patient discharge destination, and therefore captured only patients who died while in hospital. Linkage to death registers would enable better understanding of the possible effects of these virus strains on mortality, but this was beyond the scope of this study.",

More liberal admission criteria could have led to an increase in the number of non-severe cases admitted compared to other influenza seasons and therefore contributed to the observed association with reduced mortality. However, no formal policy to this effect was introduced at this hospital, and such a situation would also be likely to lead to a reduction in the average length of stay, which was not detected here.",

Further development of such data linkage methods in a routine fashion could provide a rapid means of gaining valuable epidemiological insights into emerging infectious diseases.",
