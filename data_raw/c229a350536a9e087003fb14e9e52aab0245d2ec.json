            "text": "Translation initiation of picornavirus RNA is driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element located upstream of the initiator codon. RNA structure organization as well as RNA-protein interaction plays a fundamental role in internal initiation. IRES activity has been mainly analyzed in the context of reporter genes, lacking regions of the viral genome potentially affecting translation efficiency. With the aim to understand the vulnerability of the IRES and translation start region to small molecules in the context of the viral genome, we designed a set of customized RNase-resistant 29O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (29OMe AONs) based on RNA structure data. These AONs were then used to monitor their capacity to interfere viral RNA translation, and thus, to inhibit virus yield. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA translation can be initiated at two in-frame AUG codons. We show here that a 29OMe AON complementary to AUG2 inhibited viral multiplication more efficiently than the one that targeted AUG1. Furthermore, the response of the viral RNA to AONs targeting the IRES region denoted important differences between tissue culture cells and cell-free systems, reinforcing the need to analyze viral RNA response in living cells. Importantly, we have identified four specific motifs within the IRES element that are targets for viral inhibitors both in tissue culture cells and in cell-free systems. The identified targets define accessible regions to small molecules, which disturb either the RNA structural organization or the RNA-protein interactions needed to initiate translation in FMDV RNA.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the prototype of the aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. FMDV causes a contagious disease that affects cattle and a large number of wild cloven-hoofed ungulates [1, 2] . The viral genome consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of about 8500 nts, encoding a single polyprotein, flanked by a heavily structured untranslated region (UTR) at the 59end (Fig. 1A) . Upon entry into the cell, the viral open reading frame is translated into a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases [3] . In common with all picornaviruses, the FMDV genome does not contain the cap structure (m 7 GpppN) typically present in cellular mRNAs at its 59 end. Instead, a viral protein (VPg) is covalently linked to the 59end of the viral RNA [4] . The 59UTR comprises a long hairpin (termed S), a poly(C) tract of variable length, a variable region folding as two to four pseudoknots, the cisreplication element (cre), and the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element that mediates cap-independent translation of the viral RNA [5, 6, 7] . The 39UTR consists of a region of about 90 nt and a poly(A) tail, which stimulate IRES activity and participates in viral RNA replication [8, 9] . Replication of the viral genome occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Polyprotein synthesis can start at two in-frame AUG codons separated by 84 nt [10] . Both AUGs are used as start codons for viral protein synthesis, although the second one is preferentially utilized in a variety of assays [11, 12] .",

The FMDV IRES is distributed in structural domains ( Fig. 1A) with the first 21 nt (domain 1) forming part of the cre element [14] . Domain 2 includes a polypyrimidine tract (UCUUU) that provides a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) binding site [15] . Domain 3 consists of 210 nts, the most apical region of which is arranged as a cruciform structure that plays a crucial role in RNA-RNA interaction [16, 17] . The proximal part is organized as a base-paired structure interrupted with bulges that include several non-canonical base pairs and a helical structure essential for IRES activity [18, 19] . Domain 4, which is organized into two hairpin-loops with A-rich internal bulges conserved between FMDV and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [20] is responsible for the interaction with the translation initiation factor eIF4G [21, 22] , an essential step in FMDV and EMCV IRES-dependent translation initiation. Domain 5 is composed of a conserved hairpin-loop and a polypyrimidine-rich tract preceding the first functional AUG codon. Specific RNA motifs located in domains 2, 4 and 5 are responsible for the interaction with cellular proteins such as PTB, eIF4G, eIF3 and eIF4B, amongst other host factors controlling internal initiation [23] .",

The differences in the accessibility of the IRES to DMS suggested that the IRES region adopts a different conformation in the cell cytoplasm compared to naked RNA. Similarly, results of UV-crosslinked amino-methyl psoralen-treated cells showed a local reorganization of RNA structure. Recent Selective 29Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) structural analysis revealed a modular organization of the IRES region [25] . Additionally, clusters of SHAPE reactive nts indicated the presence of flexible regions, hairpin-loops and internal bulges within the IRES domains [26] . Accessibility to the FMDV IRES was also studied through hybridization of fluorescent-labeled IRES transcripts with complementary oligodeoxynucleotides printed on microarrays. It is worth noting that the accessible regions in the microarray were also reactive to SHAPE probing, except for specific nts within the apical region of domain 3, around the GNRA (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine) stem-loop [26] .",

The resulting hybrid can block gene expression by various mechanisms, depending on the chemical composition of the oligonucleotide and location of the hybrid. The strength of the hybrid depends on factors such as thermodynamic stability, the secondary structure of the target mRNA, and the proximity of the hybridization site to functional motifs on the designated transcript such as translational start site. Unmodified oligonucleotides are unstable within cells due to rapid nuclease degradation. By contrast, phosphorothioate [27] and 29O-methyl oligoribonucleotides, carrying the 29-OH residue of the ribose molecule replaced by a methyl group, are resistant to degradation by cellular nucleases [28] . 29O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (29OMe AONs) form high melting temperature heteroduplexes with targeted mRNA [29] and induce antisense effect by a non-RNase H-dependent mechanism [30, 31] . Earlier studies have been conducted to investigate the use of antisense transcripts to inhibit FMDV viral gene expression directed against the functional AUGs [32] and to both, the 59 and 39UTR [33, 34] . An independent study using antisense morpholino oligomers targeting the viral RNA start codons also showed the capacity of these small molecules to inhibit viral FMDV multiplication [35] . The latter study showed controversial results with a previous work [36] , in which phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to AUG2 inhibited virus multiplication with greater effect than those complementary to AUG1. Despite all these studies, a deep analysis of molecules targeting the entire IRES element to inhibit viral RNA expression in cells and in vitro was lacking.",

The results indicate that the AON targeting AUG2 inhibited FMDV viral multiplication more efficiently than that which targeted AUG1 in susceptible cells. By contrast, the results obtained using cell-free systems indicated that AUG1 was the best target to inhibit translation. Remarkably, four AONs (183, 207, 432 and 452) complementary to conserved motifs within the apical region of domain 3 and domain 5, that play key roles in internal initiation [17, 37, 38] , were potent inhibitors in both systems, revealing accessible IRES regions which are candidate targets for small molecules interfering viral infectivity. Furthermore, the accessibility of different regions of the IRES to 29OMe AONs exhibited important differences when comparing the results obtained in RNA-transfected cells or in vitro translation of the same RNA. These differences, which are likely due to the composition of the cell cytoplasm and the cell-free system, emphasize the need to use living cells to measure the inhibitory capacity of small molecules.",

The control RNA, without any AON, was efficiently translated, as expected. Analysis of the translation efficiency of FMDV RNA annealed to AONs AUG1 or AUG2 revealed a marked difference in protein synthesis ( Fig. 2A) .

Translation of viral proteins in the presence of AUG2 (75% of the value observed with the control RNA alone) was non-inhibitory (P,0.01).

            "text": "Annealing of 29OMe AONs to FMDV RNA prior to program in vitro translation indicated a differential response in some, but not all, IRES regions. Specifically, AONs 183, 207, 432 and 452 were inhibitory (as observed in transfected cells). However, several AONs complementary to the apical region of domain 3 were inhibitors in vitro but not in living cells. In agreement with this result, differences in DMS and amino-methyl psoralen accessibility to naked FMDV IRES or RNA expressed in the cell cytoplasm were already noticed [24] . Since RNA structure of this particular IRES region is constrained by tertiary interactions [16, 26] , it is likely that the composition of the cell-free system differs in cofactors influencing RNA structure. Further, the differences in gene expression observed with the FMDV RNA when transfected in susceptible cells or translated in vitro suggested important conformational changes, which may depend on the interaction of the IRES with transacting factors present in different concentrations in the cell cytoplasm. In addition, interactions with other cisacting RNA elements such as the FMDV 39UTR [44] , modification of host factors in infected cells [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , or the specific intracellular environment of viral replication [51] [52] [53] [54] may differentially affect expression in these systems. However, since hamster BHK-21 or swine IBRS-2 cell lines are known to have an inactive type I IFN system in response to FMDV infection [55, 56] it is unlikely that the differences observed between the in vitro lysates and the transfected cells are due to type I interferon production.",

Disruptions caused by the AONs targeting domain 5 were not tolerated, as reflected by the reduced infectivity of FMDV RNA in the presence of the AON complementary to the hairpin (432) and the single-stranded region (452) (Figs. 6A and 7) . The inhibition induced by AONs complementary to domain 5 had similarities to those noted by AONs 40, 183 and 349, complementary to domain 2, the apical region of domain 3, or domain 4 (Fig. 3) . Another possibility to explain the inhibition noticed in domain 5 could be the steric block caused by the AONs, interfering in the landing site of the translational machinery. Our results are in partial disagreement with a previous study that used morpholino oligomers targeting domain 5, AUG1 and AUG2 to inhibit FMDV multiplication [35] . Furthermore, the concentration required to inhibit viral multiplication was higher (1-5 mM) and the interference produced by the morpholino complementary to domain 5 was lower than that of AUG1 or AUG2. Other IRES regions were not analyzed in the work by Vagnozzi et al. [35] . Morpholino-modified RNAs effectively inhibited replication of poliovirus [58] , West Nile virus [59] , dengue virus [60] , or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [61] , among other positive strand RNA viruses. More recently locked nucleic acid-based (LNA) RNAs were shown to be effective inhibitors of HCV [62] . Other RNA-based antiviral strategies were able to suppress virus multiplication in cell culture, as illustrated for HCV [63, 64] , FMDV [65] or poliovirus [58, 66] .",

One hour after adsorption, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells were washed three times, overlaid with DMEM medium with 0.5% agar supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum.
