However, reviews of the long-term effects of clinical treatments in SARS patients are lacking. Here a total of 25 recovered SARS patients were recruited 12 years after infection. Clinical questionnaire responses and examination findings indicated that the patients had experienced various diseases, including lung susceptibility to infections, tumors, cardiovascular disorders, and abnormal glucose metabolism. As compared to healthy controls, metabolomic analyses identified significant differences in the serum metabolomes of SARS survivors. The most significant metabolic disruptions were the comprehensive increase of phosphatidylinositol and lysophospha tidylinositol levels in recovered SARS patients, which coincided with the effect of methylprednisolone administration investigated further in the steroid treated non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia. These results suggested that high-dose pulses of methylprednisolone might cause long-term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations. The present study provided information for an improved understanding of coronavirus-associated pathologies, which might permit further optimization of clinical treatments.",

Soon after, HCoV-NL63 was identified in a seven-month-old infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis in 2004 1 , and followed by HCoV-HKU1 in 2005 2 . Later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide with fatality rates up to 30% 3 . Several reports have recently demonstrated the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus, which indicates that coronavirus-associated respiratory tract infections continue to have a significant epidemic potential 4-6 . Therefore, there remains an urgent requirement for standardization of treatments in order to develop more effective interventional strategies for coronavirus-associated diseases.",

Antiviral drugs, including ribavirin, lopinavir, and ritonavir, were prescribed soon after SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent 7, 8 . Type I interferon was also used owing to its inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication 9 . Furthermore, the use of convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin was reported for the treatment of SARS 10 . More frequently, corticosteroids, including methylprednisolone alone or in combination with antiviral drugs, were administered to SARS patients to prevent immunopathological lung damage 11 , although the timing and dosage regimens for steroid administration were controversial 12, 13 . The administration of high-dose pulses of methylprednisolone has been associated with psychic derangements, acute myopathy, and osteonecrosis [14] [15] [16] .

Sixteen of the recovered SARS patients (64%) had suffered lung infections during the past 12 years ( Table 1 ). The susceptibility of respiratory tract was also suggested by the fact that 13 of the 25 subjects (52%) reported having had a cold at least five times in the past year, as compared with the healthy volunteers, in which all patients reported having had less than five colds in the past year (data not shown). In addition, the recovered SARS patients had a tendency to have HL (68%), CVA (44%), and AGM (60%) ( Table 1) . Urine screening detected red blood cells in 8 of the 24 SARS subjects (33%); of these, 2 patients (8%) exhibited abnormal urine protein levels. More subjects in the recovered SARS group had a neutrophil ratio and triiodothyronine levels below the normal ranges (20% and 8%, respectively) than in the healthy volunteers (12% and 0%, respectively). Similarly, as compared with the healthy volunteers, more subjects in the recovered SARS group had triglyceride (TG) levels and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations (VLDL-C) above the normal ranges (Table 1 and S1). Together with the SF-36 Health Survey (Fig. 1) , these data demonstrated that the recovered SARS patients had a poor quality of life 12 years following recovery, and were susceptible to inflammation, tumors, and glucose and lipid metabolic disorders. Altered serum metabolomes. Although no significant differences were observed in the abundance of metabolites in the urine samples of the SARS and healthy volunteers, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed significant differences in the serum metabolome between recovered SARS patients and healthy controls ( Fig. 2A) . These data points were clustered into two distinct groups in the plot map, obviously separating the recovered SARS patients and healthy controls ( Fig. 2A) . The majority of the differentially expressed metabolites, including 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyric acid, cysteine, long-chain acylcarnitine (carnitines C18:0 and C18-OH), fructose, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, pyroglutamic acid, and myo-inositol phosphate, were upregulated in the serum samples from recovered SARS patients compared with the healthy volunteers ( Fig. 2B ).

The levels of lactic acid derived from glycolysis were elevated in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 3) . Similarly, the levels of cysteine, aspartic acid, and alanine, which can be converted to pyruvic acid, as well as the levels of succinic acid, which is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, were elevated in the recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers. In addition, the serum levels of proline, histine, and pyroglutamic acid, which can be converted into glutamic acid and enter the TCA cycle for further energy production or substance synthesis, were increased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers. While the levels of free carnitine were decreased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, the levels of carnitines C18:0 and C18-OH were increased (Fig. 3) . The ratio of carnitine (C16 + C18) to free carnitine ((C16 + C18)/C0) was also increased (Fig. 3) , which suggested that fatty acids could easily enter the mitochondria for further \u03b2-oxidation in the recovered SARS patients. The serum levels of sarcosine and spermidine were increased in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, whereas the levels of citrulline and arginine, which are intermediates of the urea cycle, were decreased ( Fig. 4) , thus suggesting that there was an increased requirement for arginine in the urea cycle in the recovered SARS patients. Several pathways exist for the synthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids, including fatty acid rearrangement via a remodeling process (Fig. 5A ). Serum levels of inositol-3-phosphate and PIs were significantly increased in recovered SARS patients compared with the healthy volunteers (Fig. 5A) . Additionally, the PI levels were positively correlated with the levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in recovered SARS patients ( Fig. 5B and C). Furthermore, VLDL was positively correlated with total TG in both the control and recovered SARS groups ( Fig. 5B and C). These results suggested that de novo synthesis of PIs was promoted during or after SARS-CoV infection.",

Our previous study reported that the pulmonary ventilation function of recovered SARS survivors was normal 19 . A significant proportion of these recovered patients were reported as having lung infections, HL, CVA, AGM, or other sequelae. Serum metabolomics analyses identified systemic metabolic alterations in these patients. The predominant metabolic dysregulations were observed in the serum, with serum levels of PIs, LPIs, FFAs, and LPCs showing the greatest disruptions. Compared with the other differentially expressed metabolites, LPIs and PIs were markedly upregulated in the recovered SARS patients. The serum levels of LPIs and PIs were not influenced by sequelae observed in these survivors (Tables S2-S5) . Subjects were regrouped based on metabolic syndromes. Statistical analyses of such subgroups indicated that the identified metabolic alterations were not associated with HL, CVA, or AGM (Figs S1-S3) . But, our results suggested that early steroid treatment could have an effect on the serum levels of PIs or LPIs in recovered SARS patients. However, in rat experiments, the levels of the detected PIs in rats intraperitoneally injected with methylprednisolone groups (10 or 30 mg/kg) were comparable to those of the untreated rats (Table S6 ), suggesting that the effect of steroid treatment on serum lipid metabolism is more complex than what we thought. PIs have previously been related to viral infections associated with lungs. For example, the membrane binding and penetration of the Ebola virus fusion peptide requires the presence of Pl in the target membrane 17 . Downstream elements of the PI signaling pathway have been shown to be involved in viral entry. The Ebola virus matrix protein, VP40, was recently shown to require Pl 4,5-bisphosphate for extensive oligomerization and viral egress 18 . Pl 4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KB) is hypothesized to have a role in the cellular entry of pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein, and cell entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike protein was strongly inhibited by knockdown of PI4KB 20 . Therefore, upregulated PIs in SARS patients may promote SARS-CoV infection and entry. However, Pls were also shown to suppress respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice 21 .",

            "text": "LPIs are thought to have a critical role in glucose homeostasis 22 . A large proportion of the recovered SARS patients reported glucose metabolic disorders, including hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and type 1 or 2 diabetes, a few years prior to this study. LPI stimulates insulin release 23 , and activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) can increase plasma insulin levels and glucose tolerance 24 . Lipidomic analyses also demonstrated increasing LPI levels in a pre-type 1 diabetic mouse model 25 . In the present study, increased rates of glycolysis with few effects on the TCA cycle were observed in the recovered SARS patients, suggesting an association between LPI and glucose metabolism in recovered SARS patients. As a result of the broad expression of GPR55 across various tissues, LPI exerts diverse regulatory roles, including in the excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons 26 , intestinal inflammation 27 , and the migration and orientation of human breast cancer 28 . This may explain the various symptoms observed in the recovered SARS patients. LPI-associated disorders may persist as long as the high serum LPI levels remain. There were a number of limitations associated with the present study. First, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the patients with glucose metabolic disorders had taken medication prior to the analyses, which may have influenced their physiological status. Second, although we endeavored to recruit as many recovered patients as possible, the sample size was small. Third, the best controls for the investigation of steroid treatment effects were to recruit SARS patients without steroid treatment. Because of lack of those controls, non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia with or without steroid treatment were collected in present study, but they may not exactly mimic the two key elements of SARS infection: steroid treatment and SARS virus infection. Therefore, the reasons for the marked increases in serum levels of LPIs and PIs in recovered SARS patients require further investigation. Changes in metabolite levels observed in our study may not reflect the real situation exactly.",

The derivatization procedure and data acquisition were performed as described previously, with some modifications 29 . Briefly, the temperature for both oximation and silylation reactions was changed to 37 \u00b0C and the oximation reaction time was reduced to 1.5 h. Serum metabolic profiling was performed in a pseudotargeted mode using a GCMS-QP 2010 Plus quadrupole mass analyzer coupled to an AOC-20i autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Chromatographic separation was performed on a DB-5 MS capillary column (30 m \u00d7 250 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). First, the quality control (QC) sample was analyzed in full scan mode with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) scan range of 33-600 Dalton to obtain the target ion for selected ion monitoring (SIM) scanning. The parameters for the full scan were as follows: the flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was constant at 1.2 mL/min; the oven temperature began at 70 \u00b0C, which was maintained for 3 min, followed by a linear increase to 310 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min, and finally holding for 6 min at 310 \u00b0C; the temperature of the inlet and interface was 280 \u00b0C, and that of the ion source was 240 \u00b0C; the detector voltage was set at 1.05 kV; the solvent delay was 5.1 min; and the event time was initiated at 0.5 s. With the integrated SIM scan table, batch analysis for all samples was conducted in pseudotargeted mode with all MS parameter settings the same as those used in full scan mode, but with the event time adjusted to 0. For the LC-MS analysis, raw data were first imported to Peak-view software for automated peak detection, alignment, and integration. After checking the derived peak table, known metabolites that had been missed or had a relative standard deviation of greater than 30% during the automated peak picking were extracted and integrated manually. Further unknown ions detected in blank samples were deleted if their intensity proportion in the blank sample was more than 1% compared with the average intensity levels in the experimental samples. The 80% rule was applied to remove peaks with missing values surpassing 20% in both groups. For mass spectrometry response normalization in both GC-MS and LC-MS analyses, the raw peak areas for each ion or metabolite were normalized to that of adjacent QCs, with the local linear regression of QC intensities selected. For the lipidomics analysis, peak picking was performed using Lipid-View software (AB Sciex). Owing to their complexity, the lipid compounds were detected by extracting the ion chromatograms to avoid the \"black box\" associated with automatically pretreated data. Adjustment of the integration parameters was performed in certain cases. The peak areas of each detected lipid compound were normalized to those of the spiked lipid internal standards according to the different lipid classes.",

For lipidomics analysis, 30-\u00b5L serum aliquots were pipetted for each sample and 200 \u00b5L methanol containing 8 lipid internal standards (PC38:0, PE34:0, LPC19:0, SM12:0, triglyceride 45:0 (TG45:0), Cer17:0, FFA16-d3 and FFA18-d3) was added, followed by a 30-sec vortex. Then, 400 \u00b5L chloroform was added and the mixture was vortexed for another 30 seconds. After that, 120 \u00b5L water was added and the extraction mixture, vortexed, and centrifuged (8,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) to form aqueous-organic separation phases. Two, 200 \u00b5L aliquots of the upper organic phase were drawn and dried, respectively, in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. Quality control (QC) samples were produced by pooling equal serum aliquots from each sample, containing the average metabolome information from the real samples included in this study. For LC-MS, GC-MS metabolic profiling and lipidomics, QC sample pretreatment was performed using the same method as that used for the actual patient samples. The QC sample was run every 10 real samples to evaluate the repeatability of sample pretreatment and for batch analysis of each analytical platform. The lipidome was analyzed using UPLC (Waters) and triple-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (AB Sciex) systems. Prior to the analysis, the dried serum samples were reconstituted in 20 \u00b5L CHCl 3 -MeOH solution (2:1 v/v) and then diluted in a mixed solvent containing ACN-MeOH-H 2 O (65:30:5 v/v/v). Subsequently, 5 \u00b5L of the diluted samples were separated using a C8 ACQUITY TM column (150 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m internal diameter). The column temperature and elution rate were set at 55 \u00b0C and 0.26 mL/min, respectively. The mobile phases A and B, which were ACN:H 2 O (6:4 v/v) and isopropanol: ACN (9:1 v/v), respectively, both contained 10 mM ammonium acetate. The initial gradient started at 32% B, which was maintained for 1.5 min, followed by a linear increase to 85% B in 14 min, and then to 97% B within 0.1 min. This condition was maintained for 2.4 min at 97% B, followed by a decline to 32% B within 0.1 min. The total run time was 20 min, including a post-equilibration time of 1.9 min. The mass spectrometry signal was scanned from a m/z of 400-1500 Dalton in both positive and negative ion modes. The capillary voltages were set at 4.0 kV and \u22123.8 kV for positive and negative modes, respectively. The capillary temperature was 350 \u00b0C.
