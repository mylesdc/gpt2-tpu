            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are undoubtedly indispensable for many regiments in cancer and antiviral therapies. In applications in which Fc-dependent effector functions are not essential, smaller fragments such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv) have several advantages over their parental antibodies. They offer rapid blood clearance and enhanced tumor penetration, which makes them a good choice for oncologic imaging [1] . Moreover, scFv are candidates for delivery of cytotoxic immunoconjugates [2] . Their efficacy had been shown as diagnostic or potential therapeutic tool for some antiviral applications [3] [4] [5] [6] . A scFv is composed of variable fragments of the light chain (vL) and heavy chain (vH) connected by a short hydrophilic polypeptide linker providing flexibility to join the two fragments. Consequently, they are expressed as a single polypeptide and are therefore easier to produce compared to full-length antibodies. A further advantage of scFv is the lack of the Fc-portion, which is responsible for the interaction of mAbs with Fc-receptors on cells, as in its absence no Fc-mediated enhancement of infection is expected. For most applications, prokaryotic or lower eukaryotic expression systems are sufficient to generate functional scFv. Although expression of scFv in E. coli has already been successful [7, 8] , the function of heterologous expressed scFv is often impaired by misfolding or toxicity to the host cells. Alternatively, expression by the yeast Pichia pastoris provides a straightforward and cost-effective microbial culturing system.",

            "text": "One of the first lines of defense to invasive pathogens is the complement system, a part of the innate immunity. The complement is comprised of more than 30 molecules, which act in different pathways to merge finally in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This complex perforates the pathogens surface causing disruption and thus complement-mediated lysis (CML). The activity of the complement system is tightly controlled by the regulators of complement activation (RCA). One important molecule for 2 BioMed Research International controlling of the complement cascade is factor H (FH). This fluid phase regulator is comprised of 20 modules, the so-called short consensus repeats (SCRs). Each SCR has a defined role within FH, one of which is the recognition of negatively charged patterns on the surface of host cells. This pattern includes sialic acids, heparan sulfates, and derivatives or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), all of which are commonly found on mammalian cell surfaces but usually not on pathogens. FH has several domains especially for recognition of these patterns. The first contact of FH to the polyanionic surface of the host cell is mediated by the C-terminal modules, that is, SCR19 and SCR20 (SCR1920) [9] . After recognition, FH undergoes conformational changes and interacts with additional complement proteins such as factor I. This results in the inhibition of complement activation and contributes to the protection of the host cell against CML. During their budding process retroviruses, such as HIV, acquire the hostcell membrane and therefore have a similar recognition pattern for FH as cellsurface of the host [10] . Thus, binding of FH to retroviruses protects them against CML similar to the host cells [11, 12] . Interfering with this FH-binding by FH-derived SCR1920 is anticipated to displace FH from the viral surface. In the absence of FH, activated complement is insufficiently downregulated on the viral surface and therefore CML is enhanced which may result in a reduction of the viral titer [12] .",

After cooling down PTM1 [21] was added aseptically and temperature was set to 30 \u2218 C, pH to 5, and controlled by 25% ammonium hydroxide. Airflow was kept from the beginning at 0.5 vvm and stirrer set at 500 rpm. Whole culturing was performed in a three-step mode. During batch phase, conditions were kept constant and dissolved oxygen was allowed to decrease. In the following fedbatch phase, first the stirrer was adapted to 800 rpm to keep DO over 20% and then airflow was increased to a maximum of 1.25 vvm, while glycerol feeding supplemented with 12 ml/L PTM1 was maintained at 16 ml/L/h. Glycerol fed-batch phase was kept for 4-6 h until reaching biomass concentration ranging from 120 to 200 g/L wet cell weight (WCW). During induction, airflow was supplemented with pure oxygen cascadically to a maximum of 40% enrichment. Temperature range was set to 20-30 \u2218 C and pH from 5 to 3 according to experiment and the fed-batch phase (glycerol feeding) was prolonged, whereas the induction time was shortened. In general, a bolus of 0.2% methanol was given 30 min prior to methanol induction and during methanol adaption, feeding was lowered until DO reached constant levels above 20%. To control current methanol concentration substrate feeding was manually interrupted and DO-spike was monitored to occur within 30 seconds and in case of delay feeding was arrested until appearance of DO-spike. Samples were taken regularly aseptically for biomass determination and controlled for pH and scFv content by immunoblotting.

To generate cDNA, we used degenerated primers matching conserved mRNA-domains such as leader peptide sequence, constant CH2 region of mouse IgG2a subclasses, or LC kappa noncoding constant domains. The sequences of these mRNAs were obtained by searching in NCBI and manual alignment. Total cellular RNA was isolated from mAb48producing hybridoma cells followed by cDNA synthesis using RT-PCR. The obtained PCR-products corresponded to the LC (Figure 1(a) ) and partial HC (Figure 1(b) ). The sample that exhibited a distinct signal at the highest annealing temperature was chosen for propagation assuming the highest specificity of primers to template under these conditions. LC and HC cDNA were isolated, cloned into pGEM-Teasy, and sequenced using M13-primers. Complementary determining regions (CDRs) were identified according to Kabat and Wu [14] . Figure 2 shows the complete nucleotide sequence and its corresponding amino acid sequence of LC (Figure 2 (a), GenBank: JX021500) and partial HC (Figure 2 (b), GenBank: JX021499), respectively. Full LC and partial HC (including CH1 and hinge-region) sequences were supposed to be sufficient to establish scFv.

Therefore, we tested expression of 48scFvSCR1920 within fermenter cultures, since fermentation of Pichia pastoris may achieve higher expression levels relative to shake flasks [31] . Pichia pastoris is able to grow in a range between pH 3 and 7 [32] . To avoid potential damage of recombinant scFv by proteases, we compared the induction at pH 5 and pH 3, since it has been reported that released proteases are less active at certain pH values [33] . We also analyzed the effect of lowered temperature on protein production. Generally, most recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris is performed at 30 \u2218 C revealing optimal for growth or biomass accumulation. Detrimental effects on protein expression above 32 \u2218 C are known [21] , but no extensive investigation has been performed using Pichia pastoris for recombinant scFv production at low temperatures. Li et al. showed that lower temperature increased cell viability and decreased protease activity [34] . To obtain comparable experiments precultures were adjusted to equal cell densities prior to inoculation of the fermentation broth. The analyses of the experiments were performed similar as those described for the shake flask experiments. At all tested conditions, 48scFvSCR1920 was expressed after 14 h of induction and the signal intensity for 48scFvSCR1920 increased over the complete period of induction ( Figure 5(a) ). The fermentation at 30 \u2218 C and pH5 (F1) showed a slight increase in signal intensity compared to the fermentation performed with the same pH and reduced temperature (F2) or the same temperature and pH 3 (F3). A boost in expression intensity was obvious at lower temperature and an induction pH of 3 (F4). After 48 h induction time, a maximum protein production was reached and maintained. The yield under the chosen conditions of fermentation F4 was 7-fold compared to F1 producing the least amount (Table 1) with no correlation between temperature and pH or biomass accumulation.",

For virus lysis assay we incubated F-MuLV with normal mouse serum (NMS) as source of complement and FH in the presence of increasing concentrations of SCR1920. The central modules of FH (SCR1112) were used as control, since this region of FH has no known binding or enzymatic activity [9] . Addition of NMS as a source of active complement induced about 40% of virolysis ( Figure 6 , lane 2). As expected, CML was not further enhanced by the control SCR1112 at all concentrations tested ( Figure 6, lanes 3-5) . In contrast, the presence of the C-terminal modules SCR1920 increased the virolysis significantly in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6, lanes 6-8) . Samples without NMS and the highest concentration of FH-derived SCRs were used as controls to exclude any direct cytotoxic effect of the SCRs on the virus (Figure 6 , lane 9 and 10). Next, we analyzed the effect of 48scFvSCR1920 in virolysis assays. CML was performed as described above. The remaining amount of infectious viral particles after treatment with NMS was determined by infecting permissive Mus dunni cells as described in the Material and Method section. Again, the addition of NMS reduced the infections titre substantially (Figure 7 , lane 2) and only 48scFvSCR1920 was able to significantly reduce the amount of infectious virions significantly at a molar ratio of 0.5 compared to the amount of FH present in the Figure 7, lanes 3-7) . As control for the SCR-moiety, 48scFvSCR1112 was used which had no effect on the CML assay. Also the unrelated scFv against Gal (kindly provided by A. Ejaz) linked to SCR1920 was ineffective (Figure 7, lane  8) . Again, a sample without NMS was used to exclude any complement-independent cytotoxicity of 48scFvSCR1920 on F-MuLV (Figure 7 , lane 10).",

Fass et al. [27] analyzed F-MuLV envelope protein by crystallography [PDB: 1AOL].

The overall binding interface of gp70 and mCAT1 is relatively large (1300\u00c5 2 ) with 30 amino acids including an essential residue W102, making up the binding pocket as identified by Fass and coworkers [27] . The docking calculation of gp70 and 48scFv revealed binding of 48scFv distant from putative binding pocket. For illustration the model of the calculated SCR1920 was superimposed to the C-terminus of 48scFv (Figure 8(c) , light blue).

In contrast, E. coli did not promote the production of functional 48scFvSCR1920 (data not shown) but allowed for initial analysis of the scFv construct. The length of the linker between HC-and LC-variable fragments and the orientation of the variable fragments, both of which may influence expression, stability and functionality, that is, binding capacity [36, 37] , were examined with 48scFv produced in E. coli. Evaluation by FACS-analysis identified the optimal construct with a 15aa linker connecting the variable fragments in variable heavy-variable light chain orientation (data not shown). As E. coli did not produce functional 48scFvSCR1920, the heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris was tested.

            "text": "To generate 48scFv-constructs, the initial experiments using shake flasks were not appropriate (Figures 4(a) and  4(b) ). Since the signal intensity for 48scFv increased over the complete induction time we assumed that no proteases were released which potentially could degrade 48scFv-constructs. For that reason, additional CA as protease-prey provided no advantage. The amount of available carbon corresponded with the accumulated biomass as well as the increased signal intensity (Supporting Information S2). This is consistent with the increased signal intensity after 24 h of 48scFv in mixedfed culture (Figure 4(a) ). It is reported that mixed feeding of glycerol and methanol in Pichia cultures can improve yield [39] . We suggest that the additional glycerol boosted biomass accumulation and therefore detectable amounts of scFv appeared earlier compared to methanol-feeding only. Remarkably, 2% methanol feeding was not cytotoxic for the cells expressing 48scFv (see Supporting Information S2), although in shake flasks methanol uptake or any other conditions are difficult to control. For 48scFvSCR1920 a similar expression profile was observed and increased availability of carbon and accumulated biomass correlated with 48scFvSCR1920-production. In cultures fed with 0.5% methanol, signal intensity increased over time, while the 2% methanol fed culture the signal intensity reached a maximum around 48 h after induction. This correlates with the increased mortality rate of about 9% (see Supporting Information S3), suggesting that 2% methanol feeding resulted in toxic concentration after 48 h of induction. A possible retarded methanol-adaption may result in local toxic concentration by repeated feeding every 24 h. This concentration may cause cell death. Subsequently the release of proteases from dying cells may cause no further increase in 48scFvSCR1920 production. A similar signal fluctuation appeared in the mixed-fed cultures (Figure 4(b) ). The additional glycerol resulted in increased biomass (Supporting Information S2), which may have also affected culturing conditions negatively in respect to aeration, starving after carbon consumption or heat development and led to potential cell death. We assume that scFv-production by increased biomass cannot counteract the negative impact of proteases which may account for the decreased signal intensity after 48 h (Figure 4(b) ). The functionality of 48scFv is not impaired by the additional SCR-modules reflected by similar binding capacity to F-MuLV infected cells for both 48scFv and 48scFvSCRs (Figure 4(c) ). While the yeast Pichia pastoris culture system successfully produced functional recombinant scFv, the yield of 48scFvSCR1920 produced in shake flasks did not fulfill our requirements. Thus, we introduced benchtop fermentation. To optimize 48scFvSCR1920 production by fermentation we tested conditions, which cannot be controlled during shake-flask culturing, that is, pH, temperature or feeding conditions. Pichia pastoris promotes high cell-density fermentation and offers several advantages to increase the level of heterologous expression. One important fact is the improved transcription rate of AOX1 promoter under growth limiting conditions compared to culturing yeast in shakeflasks [40] . The ability of Pichia pastoris to express scFv in shake flasks at pH 6 cannot be extrapolated to upscale into fermentation under similar conditions. Initial attempts with fermentation run at pH 6, 6.5, and 7 revealed no protein expression in our hands (data not shown), although positive scFvproduction has been reported under these conditions [41, 42] . Our results suggest that culturing at 30 \u2218 C has a negative effect on viability at high density fermentation ( Figure 5 (a), F1 and F3). Most probably the release of proteases from dying cells may have diminished the overall yield of secreted proteins. We identified the optimal conditions for 48scFvSCR1920production at pH 3 and 22 \u2218 C ( Figure 5(a) , F4) assuming fewer proteases due to temperature and optimal pH for its production with confirmed functionality indicated by FACS-analysis ( Figure 5(b) ).",

            "text": "FH plays an important role in recognition of self-surfaces and therefore shields hostcells from self-destruction by CML [23] . During the budding process, retroviruses acquire the host-derived membrane including proteins which bind fH [12] . Thus, fH accumulates on the viral surface protecting the pathogen from complement destruction. The C-terminal modules SCR19-20 of FH are thought to initiate the initial contact with the cell or viral surface, respectively [9] . Thus, 48scFvSCR1920 is thought to occupy binding domains of FH specifically on the viral surface targeted by the antibody fragment. Thereby MAC-formation can take place leading to lysis of viral particles or infected cells. In a first experiment, we tested the ability of the SCR-modules 19-20 (SCR1920) to interact with FH on the viral surface assessed by a viral lysis assay followed by a relative quantification of remaining viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Figure 6 shows that SCR1920 is able to enhance CML upon 200-fold excess compared to FH in the sample. FH itself has a low affinity to GAGs which is compensated by its high concentration in serum [9] . Due to the law of mass action an excess of SCR should be able to displace FH from the viral surface, since FH and SCR1920 have almost comparable affinity to negative charged surfaces [30] . Therefore, such a high concentration of SCR1920 is needed. In order to reduce the concentration of SCR-modules necessary to interfere with FH binding, the affinity of SCR1920 was artificially increased by connecting the modules to a virusspecific antibody fragment, which targets the SCR to the surface of the virus. In a tumor setting using cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lysis was specific for the tumor cells in the presence of a tumor specific antibody and SCR18-20 [43, 44] .

We assessed the CMLenhancing potential by a viral lysis assay followed by an ICA to determine the titer of the remaining infective viral particles.

Their data allow calculating the putative covering area of 48scFvSCR1920: the diameter of MuLV-virions is given with 100 nm, which corresponds roughly to 31.500 nm 2 ; 50 Env-trimers in average are present on the viral surface. Three 48scFvSCR1920 bound on each Env-trimer (trimer-radius 5 nm plus 9.4 nm SCR-radius) result in a covering area of 650 nm 2 /trimer corresponding to 32.500 nm 2 /virion.

It is reported that the parent antibody clone 48 slightly affects infection of about half a log [46] suggesting that mAb48 binds to a relevant region on gp70 for binding its cellular receptor. Detailed information about mAb48 and its target (i.e., epitope mapping) for further analysis has not been done yet. The 48scFv binds distant from the main binding pocket and may also show reduced affinity compared to its parental antibody [47] , since scFv usually exhibit reduced avidity due to their monovalent structure. Nevertheless, this in silico binding data stresses the potential of the SCR-modules and excludes neutralizing effects of the 48scFv-moiety of the scFv-SCR constructs.

The yield of the obtained product (48scFvSCR1920) by conventional shake flask cultures did not meet the requirements for further experiments. However, the production of 48scFvSCR1920 by the yeast system was improved by fermentation. We also could show that Pichia pastoris is an easy and suitable tool for our bifunctional recombinant scFv expression. Functional 48scFv recognized its viral target independent of the modification with SCR-modules. Reliable upscaling by Pichia-high-density fermentation has provided sufficient amount for expanded experiments. We further showed for the first time the powerful antiviral effect of a 48scFvSCR1920 construct most likely mediated by the displacement of FH specifically from the viral surface. This newly established principle might be a basis for further investigations to use FH-derived SCRs linked to specific Abs not only for antiviral but also for cancer therapy [43, 44] .
