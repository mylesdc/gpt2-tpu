Current genome annotation programs do not identify all of the functional elements of the genome, especially small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whole genome transcriptome analysis is a complementary method to identify ''novel'' genes, small RNAs, regulatory regions, and operon structures, thus improving the structural annotation in bacteria. In particular, the identification of non-coding RNAs has revealed their widespread occurrence and functional importance in gene regulation, stress and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in Histophilus somni, one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) as well as bovine infertility, abortion, septicemia, arthritis, myocarditis, and thrombotic meningoencephalitis. In this study, we report a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of H. somni strain 2336 using RNA-Seq method. The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map identified 94 sRNAs in the H. somni genome of which 82 sRNAs were never predicted or reported in earlier studies. We also identified 38 novel potential protein coding open reading frames that were absent in the current genome annotation. The transcriptome map allowed the identification of 278 operon (total 730 genes) structures in the genome. When compared with the genome sequence of a non-virulent strain 129Pt, a disproportionate number of sRNAs (,30%) were located in genomic region unique to strain 2336 (,18% of the total genome). This observation suggests that a number of the newly identified sRNAs in strain 2336 may be involved in strain-specific adaptations.",

Computational gene prediction methods such as Glimmer [8] or GenMark [9] use Hidden Markov models which are based on a training set of well annotated genes. Although these methods are quite efficient, they often miss genes with anomalous nucleotide composition and have several well-described shortcomings: because bacterial genomes do not have introns, detecting gene boundaries is comparatively difficult; due to the usage of more than one start codon, computational genome annotation methods may predict overlapping ORFs [10] ; prediction programs use arbitrary minimum cutoff lengths to filter short ORFs, which may lead to under-representation of small genes. In case of sRNA (small non-coding RNA) prediction, the lack of DNA sequence conservation, lack of a protein coding frame, and the limited accuracy of transcriptional signal prediction programs (promoter/Rho terminator prediction) confound computational prediction [11, 12] .",

The single nucleotide resolution map helped uncover the structure and complexity of this pathogen's transcriptome and led to the identification of novel, small RNAs and protein coding genes as well as gene co-expression. Prokaryotic genome annotation is performed often using computational gene prediction programs [8, 9] . However, these prediction algorithms are not able to identify the non-coding sRNAs, antisense transcripts, and other small proteins. To overcome the shortcomings of computational genome structural annotation, various experimental methods are used for identification of novel expressed elements [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28] . Deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged recently as a method that enables the study of RNA-based structural and regulatory regions at the genome scale. RNA-Seq technology has many advantages compared with existing array based methods for transcriptome analysis. In particular, RNA-Seq does not require probes, so the process is free from probe design issues or bias from hybridization issues. Also, the transcriptome coverage from RNA-Seq is very high [29, 30] . RNA-Seq was demonstrated to be effective for the discovery of bacterial non-coding RNAs, accurate operon definition, and correction of gene annotation [27, 31, 32] . Therefore, in the current study, we used RNA-Seq for profiling H. somni 2336 transcriptome.",

This observation is consistent with the reported 94% genome expression in Bacillus anthracis, 89.5% in Sulfolobus solfataricus, and 95% in Burkholderia cenocepacia, studied under one or more experimental growth conditions using RNA-Seq [32, 33, 34] . These results indicate that most of the bacterial genome sequence is expressed at some basal level. To identify significantly expressed regions above this baseline, we used two alternative methods (discussed in Results section) to estimate the background expression. Both methods yielded similar results (6-7 reads per base). We selected the higher stringency cutoff of 7 reads per base to minimize the number of false positives.",

Twelve of these were predicted by Rfam [23] and are similar to conserved sRNA (e.g., 6S, tmRNA, FMN) in other bacterial species, which helps validate our approach. The 83 novel H. somni sRNAs may have housekeeping function, regulatory activity, or participate in virulence as described in other pathogenic bacteria [19, 35, 36] . The identified sRNAs did not show any location specific bias across the genome. Similarly, genes known to be associated with virulence are known to be scattered across bacterial genomes [37, 38] . However, the tendency to form clusters was observed with sRNAs, which could indicate that functionally related sRNAs tend to be located in close proximity. The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map of H. somni identified 38 novel protein coding genes that were missed by the initial annotation. The average length of the proteins coded by these genes exceeds 60 amino acids, suggesting that length based cutoff was not the main reason that these genes were missed by computational gene prediction programs. The novel protein coding genes identified in the current study could serve as a training set to improve gene prediction algorithms.",

Transcriptional mapping revealed genes where the 59 untranslated sequence extended well beyond the translational start. BLAST comparisons indicated that these genes have either nonsense or missense base changes relative to homologous genes in other bacterial species, causing apparent ''truncated'' proteins compared with those in other species.
