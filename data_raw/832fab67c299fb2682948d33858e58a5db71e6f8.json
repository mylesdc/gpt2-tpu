Between 15-70% of reported cases are fatal. There is no approved vaccine available, and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously. In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus glycoproteins. Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease. This vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite. Histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus, even though they did not exhibit clinical signs. This is the first demonstration of efficacy of a CCHF vaccine.",

The most efficient and common tick vectors appear to be members of the Hyalomma genus, which commonly infest livestock and other animals. CCHF causes a severe human disease, with a fatality rate of 15-70% [3] . Due to the haemorrhagic nature of the disease, it can also cause nosocomial infections of health-care workers [4] . Although clinical predictors of mortality have been developed [5] , correlates of protection are not fully understood. Detectable antibody responses are usually required for survival, but are not predictive of recovery [6] . Therefore it is likely that both antibody and CD8-positive T lymphocytes are required for protection.",

Additionally, concerns over the potential use of CCHFv as a bioterrorism agent have led to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to list the virus as a Category C priority pathogen. Due to the severity of disease, ease of transmission, and the fact that no antiviral compounds or vaccines have been proven to be effective against it, CCHFv is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen by the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.",

A recent study found that it elicited both a cellular and humoral response to CCHFv, but neutralising antibody titres were low, even in people who had received 4 doses [13] . Controlled studies on protective efficacy have not been reported with this vaccine and, due to its crude preparation, it is unlikely to gain widespread international regulatory approval. Development of a vaccine that meets current international standards is needed. The genome of CCHFv is distributed over three RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the viral nucleoprotein, glycoprotein and RNA polymerase, respectively. The M segment is approximately 5.4 kbp in length and encodes a polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage events [14, 15] . It contains a single open reading frame of 1685 residues (in strain IbAr10200), which is processed into mature glycoproteins G N and G C , and three other domains of as-yet unknown function: a variable mucin-like domain, a GP38 domain, and an NSm domain. The G N and G C glycoproteins of CCHFv bind target cells and influence infectivity [16] and cell tropism, and are the targets for neutralising antibodies [17] . Virus entry is thought to be primarily mediated by G C , which binds the proposed virus receptor human cell surface nucleolin [18] .",

Severity of microscopic lesions in HE stained tissues from vaccinated A129 mice, challenged with CCHFv. reticulum and Golgi body, at the conserved motifs RSKR, RRLL and RKPL [15, 38, 49] . This complex series of maturation steps can cause difficulties when attempting to express recombinant G N or G C in vitro. The use of a viral vector delivery system bypasses these problems and is more likely to lead to authentic protein expression patterns. As G N , but not G C , contains a Golgi localisation signal, interaction between the two glycoproteins is required for G C to travel to the Golgi [17, 50] . Therefore, although G C may contain more neutralising or protective epitopes [17, 51] , the inclusion of G N in the vaccine design may have an advantageous effect, by assisting correct trafficking. In this work, the vaccine candidate encoded the non-structural accessory domains (mucin like domain, GP38 and NSm), as well as G N and G C . This is similar to a candidate DNA vaccine described by Spik et al [19] , but in contrast to an oral vaccine that expressed G N and G C only [20] . The structural proteins rely on Nglycosylation of G N for their correct folding and transport [52] , and G N in turn has a complex maturation process involving sequential cleavage from the accessory domains [14, 15, 38, 49] . The mucin-like and GP38 domains are required for correct transport of G N to the Golgi apparatus [17] . There is a complex interplay between the products of the glycoprotein precursor, and the absence of a critical component could have had an unexpected effect on processing and expression of the antigens.",

This response was unlikely to be transient, since a predominantly IgG response was detected after an additional 7 days. If protection is mediated via the humoral response, IgG will be required for long-term immune memory, whereas IgM is likely to provide only short term protection from disease.

Although the consistent levels of viral load seen between day 32 and day 42 may have indicated ongoing, subclinical viral replication, it is likely that the RNA was released from defective viral particles, or from virus that had been inactivated by effective immunity e.g. neutralising antibodies. Initial attempts to amplify live virus from day 42 tissue samples were unsuccessful; therefore the possibility that this vaccine induced sterilising immunity has not been excluded. Interestingly, prolonged viraemia assessed by RT-PCR has also been observed in convalescent patients, but that study did not report any attempts to recover viable virus [67] .",

Furthermore, the adaptive immune response elicited by the vaccine was not substantially affected by the absence of the type I IFN receptor in the A129 mice. Protection correlated with T-cell responses, but not antibody induction, although further studies are required to determine exactly which is the protective component. Further directions for this work could also include testing the longevity of demonstrated protective effects, and investigating whether MVA-GP confers protection against multiple CCHFv strains.",
