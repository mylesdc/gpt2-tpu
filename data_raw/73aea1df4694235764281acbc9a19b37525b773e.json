Mass gatherings are divided into different types based on their purpose. The expansion of interconnectivity between societies and increases in the number of national and international events in communities has led to an increase in the number of mass gatherings, which, despite the benefits like cultural exchange, have health challenges such as infectious disease transmission and, should therefore be considered by health planners 1 .",

The public health system can be under severe pressure, even with advanced equipment and the proper resources for prevention and control of infectious diseases 2-4 . Various factors, such as the type and location of gathering, the number of participants and the lack of access to health facilities, can affect the incidence of infectious diseases in mass gatherings. Planners must therefore pay attention to these factors in preparation 1, [5] [6] [7] . Since a mass gathering is a collection of many people together in one particular site, the possibility of infectious disease transmission due to the high population density always exists. Studies on mass gatherings such as Hajj, Ashura day in Karbala, and Kumbh Mela and Sabarimala in India show the prevalence of infectious diseases in these ceremonies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

One of the world's largest religious gatherings is the Arbaeen ceremony, which happens on the 40 th day after the anniversary of Imam Hussein's martyrdom, the third Shiite Imam. In the Ashura event, pilgrims walk to Karbala, south of Baghdad. Based on the statistics of 2017, the number of Iranian pilgrims taking part in the Arbaeen ceremony was 2,320,000 16 .",

In mass gatherings, infectious diseases are threats to global health security and even the political security of countries. Therefore, planning, communication and public health supervision are important in these religious ceremonies 1, 8 . Mass gatherings are different from structured disasters so that in case of occurrence, many people will be affected 17 . Since the Arbaeen ceremony is held with the presence of many pilgrims from many different countries and, like the Hajj pilgrimage, is based on the lunar calendar, and it is held in Iraq, there is the possibility of the occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases. It is therefore essential to be prepared to control and prevent these diseases. Dealing with infectious diseases in Arbaeen is considered a challenge for policy makers 10 . According to Arbaeen's social and cultural context, it seems essential to take a deeper look in this field. On the other hand, there is relatively little knowledge about the Arbaeen ceremony; therefore, a qualitative method for clarifying the concept and challenges of health system preparedness in Arbaeen ceremony is necessary. The aim of this study was to explore challenges of health system preparedness for communicable diseases in Arbaeen ceremony.",

Education can also help to identify health risks and respond to them by identifying effective factors in combating infectious diseases. The training of health instructors and guidelines from people who are trusted and accepted by pilgrims, such as missionaries and religious leaders, can have a positive impact on their beliefs. The main point of training is to determine the targeted group both at the level of pilgrims and health directors and consider the training needs of each group in preparing training guidelines.",

Past conducted studies of religious gatherings such as the Hajj in Saudi Arabia and Ashura Day in Iraq, as well as other mass gatherings, such as the Tamworth Country Music Festival, Australia, indicate the reality that a crowd of people from diverse nations and cultures is a source of infectious disease; disease transmission is one of the most important challenges of public health in these kinds of events, so using training strategies in relation to hand washing, masking and vaccination is an important factor in preventing the diseases and health improvement 8,14,16,23-33 .

Besides this, the Hyogo framework and sustainable development goals emphasize the role of training in increasing risk understanding and decreasing the vulnerability of individuals to hazards 35-37 . In this study, one of the health issues was fatalism and a low understanding of risk. A study concerning the beliefs and methods of infection control in Hajj pilgrims residing in Australia also showed that the majority of participants had low understanding of the occurrence of respiratory infections and the need for an influenza vaccine in Hajj, and refused the vaccine, using trust in Allah as an excuse and belief in destiny when dealing with the risk of disease 38 . Another problem is also the prevalence of self-treatment among pilgrims.

One of the most common causes of infectious disease is the epidemiology triangle, which has three components-pathogen, host and environment. The interaction of these agents causes infectious diseases, and considering these factors can help control infectious diseases 41 . Considering the three factors in Arbaeen is very important. The 'host' factor includes different pilgrims with diverse cultures and nationalities. The 'environment' factor includes holding the ceremony in Iraq, which, due to the many years of internal and external conflicts, has had little attention paid to its health infrastructure, and also the overall environmental factors effective in the occurrence of infectious diseases. Different studies 1, 8, 42 have shown that factors such as crowd size, equipment, climate, the event duration and location, the type of ceremony, and features and behavior of participants affect the occurrence of diseases in mass gatherings, and planners must consider it during preparations. To prevent the occurrence of contagious diseases and their consequences, comprehensive planning, rapid diagnosis and effective management is required 1, 8, 42 . One of the factors that affects the occurrence of disease is the time of year that the Arbaeen ceremony is held. Arbaeen ceremony is held based on the lunar calendar and so its needs and challenges differ and are dependent on the season that the ceremony is held, so that if the ceremony is held in cold seasons, respiratory diseases are more common and if is held in hot seasons, the majority of infectious diseases are of the digestive system. Additionally, population movement among different countries leads to the transfer of local diseases, so health considerations and cooperation between states are needed.. Policymakers should consider three components-pathogen, host and environment-before the beginning of Arbaeen mass gathering. It is also necessary that the health system is aware of all possible scenarios and the methods for dealing with them. The preparedness plan at the local level includes assessing the risk, resources capacity, equipment, surveillance system and an expert team for providing services to pilgrims.",

The term 'health infrastructures' refers to health facilities and their related factors. The infrastructure includes staff instructions, processes and the development of systematic approaches related to personnel resources and medical support plans 43 . Various studies indicate that readiness for structured mass gatherings depends on investing in health infrastructures and the size of gatherings, and strengthening infrastructures and post-event coordination of mass gatherings must be continued. The inappropriate location of gatherings, the weakness of facilities and the lack of infrastructure increase the vulnerability of communities 44, 45 . The remoteness of health facilities and a lack of needed road infrastructure can make medical services and emergency assistance ineffective. Limitation of infrastructure and medical care system, increase the incidence of injuries 44, 45 . Arbaeen is held in a country that has long been involved with interior and exterior wars; therefore, it seems that due to economic difficulties, it does not have the capacity to support the necessary health infrastructure required by pilgrims. Although according to the participants, the health system in Iraq seems somewhat weak, given that Arbaeen ceremony is of particular popularity among Shia Muslims and is held annually, therefore, some of the activities serving pilgrims and its management during the Arbaeen ceremony is voluntarily conducted. In recent years, numerous health facilities have been constructed on religious places, as well as along the path of pilgrimage using pilgrims' donations. Management of pilgrims' donations can help to build and maintain health infrastructure in Iraq. With this policy, the Iranian pilgrims will benefit from the Arbaeen ceremony, and the level of health in the region will be improved.",

We hope this paper will serve as a key reference on health aspect of Arbaeen Ceremony in near future. A few minor issues should be addressed before the manuscript is published. The reference list needs to be revised, we note some misplacement error. For example, in the third paragraph of the introduction (p 3), \"Based on the statistics of 2017, the number of Iranian pilgrims taking part in the Arbaeen ceremony was 2,320,000\", the reference given for this is number 16. ineffectiveness of health education. Emerging of All four themes has been verified by the participants' comments which made results acceptable. The method of analysis is appropriately explained which can facilitate the reproducibility. The authors conclude that the main factor in preventing communicable disease is pilgrim-based training long before the ceremony. This conclusion is adequately supported by the results.",
