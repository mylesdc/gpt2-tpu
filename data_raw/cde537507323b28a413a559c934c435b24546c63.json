Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) migration patterns of the genome segments showed that RpMRV-YN2012 contained 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The whole genome sequence of RpMRV2012 was determined. The consensus terminal sequences of all segments of 5'-GCUAh. . .yUCAUC-3' (h = A, U or C; y = C or U) were similar to the MRV species within the genus Orthoreovirus. Its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel serotype 2 MRV that may have originated from reassortment among bat, human, and/or pig MRV strains which associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in animals and humans.",

MRVs have been isolated from many mammalian species, including humans and bats [4, 5] ; however, the natural reservoirs or direct progenitors remain unclear. The significance of bats as a source of emerging infectious diseases has been recognized. Bats also are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts for viruses which can cross species to infect humans and other domestic and wild mammals [6] [7] [8] . Indeed, many recent outbreaks of emerging viruses, such as the Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-like CoVs), have been associated with bat transmission events [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Isolation from pool urine and pool feces samples was attempted in BHK-21 and Tb1Lu cell lines. One isolate was obtained from one pool urine samples of Rhinolophus pusillus, designated RpMRV-YN2012.

The isolate was plaque-purified and visualized by negative-staining electron microscopy ( Fig. 2A) , revealing the presence of many non-enveloped icosahedral virus particles of *75 nm in diameter, morphologically related to reoviruses. Ultra-thin sections of infected BHK-21 cells displayed typical electron-dense virus particles, organized in a paracrystalline pattern within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B ).

            "text": "Bats, as the most abundant, diverse, and geographically dispersed vertebrates on earth, have been shown recently to be the reservoir hosts of a variety of zoonotic viruses responsible for severe human disease outbreaks, some with very high mortality [6] . However, reports on the isolation of orthoreovirus from bats are limited. Nelson Bay virus (NBV) was the first bat-origin orthoreovirus isolated in 1968 from the heart blood of a flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) in New South Wales, Australia [22] . In 1999, the second bat-borne orthoreovirus, called Pulau virus (PulV), was isolated from fruit bat urine collected on Tioman Island, Malaysia [23] . In 2007, a novel bat-origin orthoreovirus, Melaka virus (MelV), was isolated from a patient with acute respiratory disease in Melaka, Malaysia, and the data provided suggested that this new orthoreovirus is capable of human-to-human transmission; this was the first report of an orthoreovirus in association with acute human respiratory diseases [24] . In 2008, the fourth member of the NBV species group, Kampar virus (KamV), was isolated from a human patient with fever and acute respiratory illness, and was suggested to be a bat-borne orthoreovirus by epidemiological data [25] . Since then, bat-borne orthoreoviruses have received much attention, and five additional orthoreoviruses (Xi-River, Kampar, Sikamat, HK23629/07 and Broome viruses) have been isolated from fruit bats, or humans with assumed contact with bats [26] [27] [28] [29] . MRV infection in humans has been shown to be fairly common and the infections are often shown to be asymptomatic or associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory or gastrointestinal illness in infants and children [3] . Recent studies have shown that MRV can cause severe illnesses in humans and other mammals, including upper respiratory tract infections, encephalitis, and diarrhea [4, 5, 18] . In this study, we describe the first isolation of a novel natural reassortant MRV strain, named RpMRV-YN2012, from the least horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus pusillus) during a viral carriage study of bats in southwestern cities of Yunnan Province, China.",

The S1 gene segment of mammalian reovirus is bicistronic, encoding both the viral attachment protein sigma-1 (\u03b41) and the non-structural protein (\u03b41 s) from overlapping open reading frames [1, 3] . The viral \u03b41 protein is unique to each prototype of mammalian reovirus and determines the serotype and also is the major genetic determinant of neurovirulence in infected mice [1] [2] [3] . The S1 gene of RpMRV-YN2012 showed far greater similarity to serotype 2 tou05 (84.9%/91.1%, nt/aa identity) than it did to serotype 1 and 3 MRVs S1 genes ( Table 3) . The phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of the complete S1 segment showed RpMRV-YN2012 closely related to serotype 2 MRVs and was most divergent from the serotype 1 and 3 MRVs. However, based on the other segments, the reconstructed tree sorted RpMRV-YN2012 to serotype 3 MRVs (Fig. 3) . These data confirm that RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel serotype 2 MRV that may have originated from reassortment among serotype 2 and 3 MRVs. Until now, most of the orthoreoviruses identified in bats belong to the Pteropine orthoreovirus species or serotype 3 MRVs [18, 21, 30] . RpMRV-YN2012 is the first serotype 2 MRV isolated from bats.",
