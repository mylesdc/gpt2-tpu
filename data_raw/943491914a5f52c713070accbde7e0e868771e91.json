However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route. Our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses.

In particular, mucosal antibodies can readily neutralize invading viruses at the luminal site of the epithelial layer and prevent their entry into host cells. Such an immune exclusion effect is mainly mediated by secretory IgA (SIgA), which is effectively induced by mucosal but not parenteral immunization [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, intracellular viruses can be neutralized during transcytosis of dimeric SIgA through the epithelial layer. Furthermore, for rapidly changing viruses like influenza virus, SIgA has been shown to be more crossreactive than IgG and to neutralize antigen-drifted homosubtypic and even antigen-shifted heterosubtypic virus strains [6] .",

Furthermore, due to the default Th2oriented nature of mucosal immunity, mucosal immunization shows limited induction of Th1-related antibody subtypes (eg.

So far, little is known about prime-boost strategies for optimization of mucosal and systemic immune responses to protein-based influenza vaccines. A study in horses using an ISCOMadjuvanted influenza vaccine showed that intranasal boosting after intramuscular (IM) priming does not have much effect on serum IgG levels, but results in low and transient SIgA and IgG responses in nose washes [18] . However, no comparison was performed with alternative immunization strategies.",

Here, we used GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine to identify an immunization strategy that effectively elicits influenza-specific immune responses at both mucosal and systemic sites. To this end, we compared the immune responses elicited by two mucosal strategies with the adjuvanted influenza vaccine to the responses obtained by a strategy involving a mucosal prime followed by a systemic booster immunization. Two different mucosal administration routes were evaluated: intranasal (IN) and intrapulmonary (IPL). We observed that systemic boosting was not as effective as mucosal boosting for induction of mucosal SIgA. Systemic boosting enhanced systemic IgG titers to higher levels than mucosal boosting in IN-primed, but not in IPL-primed mice. Yet, systemic boosting generally stimulated stronger Th1 cellular immunity than mucosal boosting.

The viral nucleocapsid was further removed from the preparation by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, detergents were removed by Biobeads SM2 (634 mg/ml, Bio-Rad, Hercules, Canada) prewashed with methanol.",

Interestingly, systemic boost resulted in significantly enhanced serum IgG2a responses in 5 out of the 6 IN-primed mice (p=0.0057 for the comparison between 2N and N+M). In contrast, systemic boost had a negative effect if any on IgG2a titers in IPL-primed mice. Irrespective of the immunization strategy, the overall antibody responses elicited by GPI-0100adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine were dominated by the Th2-related antibody subtype IgG1.",

IN-primed mice developed no mucosal and poor systemic antibody responses when boosted via the IN route.

IPL/IM approach, on the other hand, resulted in relatively modest mucosal antibody responses, although it was equally effective as IPL/IPL strategy for the induction of systemic antibody responses.

For IN priming, we used a low vaccine volume of 5 \u00b5l to retain the antigen in the nasal cavity [31] . This allowed us to clearly distinguish IN from IPL immunization. We observed that IPL but not IN immunization was effective in inducing mucosal SIgA as well as IgG responses. While the robust mucosal antibody titers observed from the IPL/IPL group could be a result of successful induction of local memory responses, the poor mucosal responses in the IN/IN group indicate that IN delivery of influenza vaccine used in the current study barely primed mucosal responses. Yet, IM boost of INprimed mice though not inducing mucosal SIgA responses did elicit mucosal IgG responses. It has been reported that mucosal IgG can be derived from serum when present in high concentration, and reaches the nose and especially the lungs by transudation [32] . Indeed, except for the IPL/IPL group, mucosal and serum IgG responses elicited from the other groups shared the same trend: IN/IN < IM/IM << IN/IM = IP/IM. The positive correlation between mucosal and serum IgG responses from these groups were confirmed by Spearman analysis (The coefficient for nose IgG vs. serum IgG and lung IgG vs. serum IgG are 0.59 (p=0.0013) and 0.72 (p<0.0001) respectively). Our results are generally in line with an earlier study by Minne and coworkers who tested to which extent the delivery site in the respiratory tract impacts on the immune response elicited by influenza vaccines [33] . These authors used mice primed IN with a whole inactivated virus vaccine administered in a volume of 20 \u00b5l. The primed mice were then boosted by administration of split antigen to different parts of the respiratory tract or to the hind muscles. An IN boost resulted in poor mucosal antibody responses (except for nose SIgA) while administration deep into the lungs elicited strong nose and lung SIgA and IgG responses as observed in our study. An IM boost was not effective in stimulating mucosal SIgA, but did boost mucosal IgG responses to similar extents as a boost deep into the lungs. Thus, in agreement with our previous study, we conclude that the IPL route is much more effective than the IN route for priming mucosal antibody responses [28] . Moreover, it is the optimal route for boosting such responses.",

            "text": "Next to mucosal antibodies, systemic IgG antibodies play an important role in protection from severe influenza illness, since they can transudate into the lungs and prevent excessive viral replication and tissue damage upon infection [32] . This is the basis for protection provided by conventional parenterally administered influenza vaccines. In our study, priming via either the IN or the IPL route resulted in detectable serum IgG responses 21 days later, although these responses were significantly lower for IN-primed mice ( Figure S1 ). An IN boost did stimulate the serum IgG responses, but HAI titers could not be detected. An IM boost was essential to achieve systemic antibody responses comparable to or even better than those of the control group immunized IM with non-adjuvanted vaccine. Therefore, even though IN priming elicited only very modest serum antibody responses, memory B cells formed through the priming could be readily activated upon IN or IM boosting. Yet, optimal boosting required antigen administration via the IM route. Our results confirm earlier results from studies on influenza, HSV, HIV-1, and SARS, which all found that IN priming, whether given by protein, DNA or recombinant virus vaccines, should be followed by IM boost for induction of optimal serum antibody responses [21, 23, 24, 33] . For IPLprimed mice, IM and IPL boosting were equally effective in eliciting serum IgG and HAI titers. Also in our earlier study and in the study by Minne et al., an IPL boost was found to result in particularly strong systemic antibody responses [28, 33] . Thus, strong systemic antibody responses can be achieved by either two IPL immunizations or IPL priming followed by IM boosting. In addition to the magnitude, the phenotype of an immune response also determines the effectiveness of its protection against invading pathogens. A Th1 type immune response, characterized by IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3 production in mice, has been shown to correlate positively with improved protection against influenza virus [13, 30] . Yet, Th1 immunity was barely induced by IM/IM immunization with plain influenza vaccine or IN/IN immunization with GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. IM boosting of IN-primed mice significantly enhanced the Th1 arm of the immune response. The superior quality of the immune responses elicited by IN/IM immunization over IN/IN immunization, and even IM/IM immunization with unadjuvanted vaccine, was in line with earlier studies [21, 23, 24, 33] . As for IPL immunization, GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine elicited marginal IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3 responses using IPL/IPL approach. Interestingly, IM boosting somewhat decreased the IgG2a response, but significantly enhanced the IFN-\u03b3 response of IPL-primed mice. This is in contrast to the study by Minne et al., which showed that IM and IPL boost are both effective in eliciting IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3 responses [33] . The different results from the two studies are possibly due to differences in the vaccine formulations used. Minne et al. used a high dose (5 \u00b5g HA) of whole inactivated virus (WIV) and a low dose (1.5 \u00b5g HA) of split virus for the priming and boosting respectively. WIV possesses natural adjuvant activity from ssRNA (as TLR-7 ligand) and effectively induces Th1 responses [34] . Subunit vaccine used in the current study, on the other hand, is rather ineffective in eliciting Th1 responses and results in a Th2dominated immune phenotype. Although IM boosting enhances Th1 immunity of IN and IPL vaccines to a different extent, the overall immune responses elicited by GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered following different immunization strategies were dominated by a Th2 phenotype. Taken together, immunization strategies involving a mucosal prime followed by a systemic booster or IPL/IPL with properly adjuvanted influenza vaccines are at least as effective as conventional parenteral immunization in inducing systemic antibody responses. This is important since regulatory authorities request that influenza vaccines fulfill quality criteria based on serum HAI titers [35] . Meanwhile, pulmonary immunization probably also raises local memory B cell and T cell responses in the respiratory tract, a phenomenon observed upon influenza infection but not upon intramuscular immunization [36, 37] . Thus, mucosal priming is essential for the localization of memory immunocytes to the respiratory tract, which would allow them to respond rapidly to an influenza virus challenge [36, [38] [39] [40] . Moreover, memory B cells primed by the mucosal, but not the systemic, route preferentially express SIgA, which is the major antibody subtype which mediates early immune exclusion and also exhibits cross-protective capacity. Hence, IN/IM, IPL/IM or IPL/IPL immunization regimens should be further explored to come to optimized immunization regimens for protection from respiratory viral infections. Figure S1 .

Interestingly, influenzaspecific IFN-\u03b3 responses in mucosally-primed mice were significantly enhanced by IM boost as compared to mucosal boost (p=0.0264 and 0.004 for the comparison of 2N and N+M and the comparison of 2P and P+M respectively). H1N1specific IL-4 responses were readily detected in all immunized mice but were relatively lower in mice immunized via the IN/IN regimen. In IN-primed mice, IM boost was significantly more effective then IN boost in enhancing the number of IL-4producing T cells (p=0.004 for the comparison of 2N and N+M). A similar effect was not observed in IPL-primed mice.",
