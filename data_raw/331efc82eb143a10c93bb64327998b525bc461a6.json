The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the probiotic potential and safety of LAB strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wild boar from the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. Amongst all of the isolated LAB strains, five isolates identified as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecium, were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt. The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice. This study revealed that these LAB isolates, especially L. salivarius M2-71, possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health.",

And in recent years, researches have confirmed that the addition of probiotics to feed supplements is a promising approach for exerting a positive effect on the pigs in different growth stages (43) . However, to ensure the efficiency and safety of these bacteria, they must be systematically identified and characterized. The purpose of our research was to analyze the potential probiotic characteristics and evaluate the safety of the LAB isolated from the wild boar in order to explore potentials for the development of feed additives for animals. This is the first report, to our best knowledge, to evaluate the probiotic characteristics of the LAB strains isolated from wild boar. The bile salt in the duodenum and the acid condition of the stomach has been reported as the biggest obstacles to the survival of LAB in the GI tract of host (44) . In the study, the different levels of resistance to bile salt of five isolates may depend on the expression of bile resistance-related proteins in the LAB cells (45) . The isolates were also found to vary in the survivability in acidic conditions. These results are probably due to the speciesand/or strain-dependent acid-tolerance mechanism (26) with certain bacterial proteins that might provide the resistance (46) .",

The L. mucosae LM1 strain isolated from pig feces has been considered as potential probiotic because of its adhesion to pig ileum mucous and inhibition of intestinal pathogens in vitro (28, 48) . Lactobacillus salivarius as common gut inhabitants of raised pigs have been proven to offer benefits for gut health of pigs (49) . The LAB isolated from wild boar in this study colonized in their host intestinal tract. Therefore, it is expected that these LAB isolates could be more adaptable to internal environment than other LAB. Enterococcus are also autochthonous flora in the GI tract of host and have different useful functions in dairy industry. Beneficial effects of the addition of Enterococcus to diets include improvement of the pig's intestinal microbiota and performance, and immune modulation (50) .",

Therefore, aggregation may constitute one kind of defense mechanisms of host for anti-infection (52) . In this study, five LAB isolated from the same wild boar were observed to have different levels of autoaggregation and coaggregation. This may be a result of complex interplay among bacteria surface molecules, such as proteins, and secreted factors, etc. A previous study has confirmed that any potential aggregation phenotype depends on possible internal factors and the environment (53) . The components related to the aggregation phenotype of these isolates need to be identified. Moreover, LAB expressing the aggregation-promoting factors could further promote eliminating pathogens via balancing gut microbial ecosystems and the coaggregation mechanism. Thus, the isolated LAB in this work possessing the ability to autoaggregate and coaggregate pathogens could be beneficial to the intestinal health. Likewise, the high coaggregation level can facilitate the presence of these strains in the intestinal tract of animals.",

Adherence not only enables probiotics to live longer in the GI tract and enhances the interactions of bacteria and host, but also helps itself to overcome gastric motility (55) . Therefore, the adhesion ability to mucosal surfaces and epithelial cells is a crucial feature of probiotics. A possible explanation to the adhesive ability of isolates varying from strain to strain in our study is that each of the strains has specific cell-surface molecules to play roles in the ability of adhesion. These molecules may mediate attachment to intestinal mucosa and regulate the immune system. Al Seraih et al. previously reported that high autoaggregation ability is correlated with strong adhesion (56) . Similar results have been observed in the current study that the L. mucosae M6-29 and L. salivarius M2-71, with strong aggregation ability, have stronger capacity to adhere to cells than other isolates. It is supposed that aggregation factors which favorably increase H-bonding between and among cell surfaces have correlation with increased general adhesion ability (29) . Our results support the hypothesis that a notable correlation was observed between aggregation and adhesion. Although the relation of the aggregation and adhesion was not characterized in this study, it would be an interesting topic for the next project.",

These strains as putative probiotics should have antimicrobial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic microorganisms. Among our LAB isolated from wild boar, L. salivarius M2-71 had the strongest antibacterial activity and a significant co-aggregation ability. Actually, antimicrobial activities are also related to coaggregation. The intimate contact between probiotics and pathogenic bacteria occurs during co-aggregation and the antimicrobial substances produced by the former can inhibit pathogens (61) .

In this research, none of the three Enterococcus isolates causes the lysis of erythrocytes of sheep blood or harbors virulence factors, and thus they can be regarded as the candidates for safe probiotics. The effects on the general health of animals are used to evaluate the safety profile of probiotic isolates. In order to assess the effects of probiotics on overall health condition, body weight gain and organ indices have been established and measured. No differences in organ indices, noticeable abnormal behavior, and loss in body weight were monitored after 3-week feeding with the LAB strains, indicating that these five isolates administered did not adversely affect the general health of mice. At the same time, M6-29 and M2-71 supplementation can increase growth performance to some extent. Our results further support the increasing evidence that LAB supplementation may have a healthy and beneficial effect on the animals.",

The antibiotic resistance in these beneficial microbes is thought to be beneficial to the survival of antibiotics in the GI tract. The probiotics with endogenous resistance can restore intestinal flora after antibiotic treatment (65) . The resistance of LAB against different antibiotics is one of the most important factors for safety assessment (66). Klose et al. described for the first time selective isolation of intrinsically vancomycinresistant Lactobacillus species from the intestine of wild boar, and determined the prevalence of antibiotic resistance (47) . The similar results were found in current study that the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, while susceptible to chloramphenicol. The most probable encounter route of domestic pigs with antibiotics will be through feed, water, and antibiotics used as prophylaxis. But it is not clear how wild boar acquire antibioticresistant LAB in their GI tracts.",
