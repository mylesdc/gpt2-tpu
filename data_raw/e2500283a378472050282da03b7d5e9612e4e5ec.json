However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005-15. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015.

In particular, air travel has allowed human hosts or carriers of pathogens to move long distances within the incubation period of infections [5] , such as the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and yellow fever [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , or the parasites that cause malaria [12] [13] [14] . Regarding to the continual growth of international tourist arrivals, from 25 million in 1950 to 1.2 billion in 2015 [15] , understanding the global dynamics of infectious disease has become a major 21st-century challenge, and mechanistic or mathematical models built with air-transportation data been widely used to measure risks of arriving infected humans, growth rate of an introduced epidemic and the impact of specific surveillance and control strategies [2, 6, 16, 17] .",

However, most previous modelling studies have only focused on some of these components, and the seasonal and inter-annual risks of international spread of infectious diseases have rarely been quantified [6, 16, [19] [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, the relative exposure risk and importation probability in travelers are likely to differ between local residents in endemic regions and residents of non-endemic areas traveling to endemic countries [21, 23, 24] . Given the global expanding distribution of Aedes mosquitoes [1] , dengue has established itself throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions in both endemic and epidemic transmission cycles, causing significant morbidity and mortality, particularly highly endemic in South-East Asia (SEA) [24] [25] [26] . However, dengue remains a seasonal disease in China, with epidemics occasionally triggered by imported dengue viruses (DENV) [27] . More than 90% of imported cases between 2005 and 2014 originated from SEA [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Following China's economic boom in the last two decades, the number of Chinese citizens travelling abroad has increased from 5 million in 1996 to 128 million in 2015 [32] . Recent government led initiatives to further foster international trade may contribute to increased flows between SEA and China [33] , which could also increase the number of importations of pathogens including DENV.",

As international travel between SEA and China by airplane is fast and common, based on the assumption that human mobility via commercial air travel is an important conduit for the spread of infectious diseases internationally, we constructed a branching process model by focusing on the seasonal and multiannual movement of DENV from the endemic countries in SEA into China via air travelers of Chinese and SEA residents between 2005 and 2015. We then retrospectively quantified and validated the seasonal risks, ranging from zero to certain (1), of DENV importation from nine SEA countries and leading to autochthonous transmission (introduced transmission) in China, identified geographic and seasonal patterns of emerging origin-destination routes, and estimated the number of imported infections in Chinese travelers and SEA residents into China. With rising concerns about global pathogen dispersal, this study provides approaches and evidence that can inform efforts to mitigate the spread of DENV and other arboviral pathogens including Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses from endemic regions.",

To account for the substantial underreporting of dengue infections in official statistics, the monthly dengue data was further adjusted by an expansion factor (EF) and the proportion of asymptomatic infections ( Table B in S1 Appendix). The EF has been commonly used to estimate the total number of dengue incidence from officially statistics [35] [36] [37] . Based on the approaches of previous studies [36, 37] , the countryspecific EF and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) were estimated as the total number of dengue episodes in a specified population divided by the episodes reported, with the necessary data obtained from systematic literature review or extrapolated for countries where no empirical studies were available. We also assumed that the apparent illness represents approximately 20% (SD 10%) of all dengue infections [38, 39] . The data sources and collation are detailed in S1 Appendix.",

In brief, the probability (p IMPORT ) of at least one DENV-infected traveler importation via air travel from SEA and being infectious after arriving China was defined as a single-step Poisson process depending on: (1) the risk of infection in travelers during the period of stay in country with ongoing dengue virus transmission; (2) the probability of non-Chinese residents in SEA traveling into China and the probability of Chinese travelers returning to China; and (3) the duration of infection in humans as the length of the intrinsic incubation period for DENV plus the time that a person remains viremic after onset, referring to the period over which an infected person could travel and experience symptomatic disease or transmit DENV to mosquitoes [18, 34] . Furthermore, based on the Poisson distribution of DENV importation risk, we derived the expected monthly number of imported infections via air travel, and the Granger causality test [41] was used to examine the performance of estimated time series for predicting the reported time series.",

Therefore, our findings must be considered in the context of several assumptions and data limitations. First, the quality of incidence data on dengue incidence in SEA and China likely varies due to differences in surveillance systems including case definitions, reporting methods, availability of healthcare and laboratory diagnosis, under reporting, and the completeness and accuracy of data reported. Second, the risk of dengue infection in SEA was assumed to be identical across each country, without considering the immunity of different serotypes in Chinese travelers and SEA residents. Third, we only estimated the risk of the Chinese and SEA residents, but the actual nationalities in travelers might be much complex, not only the Chinese and SEA residents, but also the residents from other countries passing through SEA on their way to China. Fourth, we regarded Ae. albopictus as an equally competent vector to Ae. aegypti for DENV, with similar temperature dependency and extrinsic incubation period. Fifth, our estimates did not address variability in the public health and healthcare capacity and resources for different years and locations in China and SEA countries in response to dengue. Furthermore, due to the availability of monthly disease incidence in SEA countries and the absence of monthly travel data by land and water from SEA into China and within China, we only estimate the seasonal risk of introduction through air travel for nine SEA countries. Therefore, the total risk of dengue introductions from all SEA countries into China must be underestimated in this study. To solve these problems in future studies, the monthly dengue incidence for all countries could be estimated by mathematical models based on epidemiological and entomological parameters and climate data, and the seasonal and multiannual cross-border population movements could be further estimated by gravity-type spatial interaction models or using novel sources of data, e.g. mobile phone data or social media data [50] [51] [52] .",

Moreover, it may be used to project into the future given different scenarios and to quantify the effects of different control methods.
