            "text": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that influenza causes substantial burden on mortality and morbidity [1] [2] [3] . Reliable estimates for disease burden associated with influenza in the community are essential for public health policy-making. However the case numbers of influenza infections derived from medical records grossly underestimated the true burden [4] . During 2001 to 2009 there were only 138 deaths registered in Hong Kong with underlying cause of influenza infection [5] . Underreporting of influenza cases was due to the fact that influenza infections usually caused relatively mild symptoms and many infected people did not seek medical care from hospital or clinic. Among outpatients and inpatients with influenza-like illness, few were tested for influenza to get confirmed diagnoses. Even for those with laboratory confirmed infections, influenza was rarely recorded as underlying cause of death on their death certificates. Several statistical models have been used to quantify the disease burden attributable to influenza [6] . Among these models, Poisson regression models have become increasingly popular in recent years [7] [8] [9] . Unlike most of the other models, the Poisson model does not require clear seasonality of influenza to define influenza epidemic and nonepidemic periods. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for tropical and subtropical regions where influenza seasonality is less clear and influenza viruses could be circulating throughout the whole year.",

            "text": "Another advantage of the Poisson model lies in its ability to adjust for multiple seasonal confounders simultaneously. There are two types of confounders that are often considered in Poisson models: measured confounders, such as meteorological factors, circulation of other respiratory pathogens and air pollution [10] ; and unmeasured confounders, such as seasonal change in host susceptibility and health seeking behavior [11] . However, overadjustment of confounders may result in underestimation of true effects, as some variations caused by influenza were allocated to confounders. Likewise, inadequate adjustment could lead to residual confounding that causes spurious association between influenza proxy variable (such as proportions of specimens testing positive for influenza) and health outcome of mortality or hospitalization. Therefore, proper adjustment of confounders is critical for obtaining reliable estimates of influenza-associated disease burden. Previous studies using Poisson models adjusted for unmeasured confounders by incorporating sinusoidal pairs [12] [13] [14] [15] or a smoothing function of time trend into the Poisson model [8, 16, 17] . However, few studies has properly discussed on how to determine the adequacy of adjustment for seasonal confounders in the model. Here we conducted a simulation study with the aim to compare the performance of several commonly adopted model selection criteria, in terms of selecting the best-fit Poisson model with adequate adjustment for confounders. Four model selection criteria were considered in this study: quasi Akaike information criterion (QAIC), quasi Bayesian information criterion (QBIC), partial autocorrelation functions of residuals (PACF), and generalized cross-validation (GCV).",

To derive a proper estimate for influenza-associated mortality or morbidity, it is important to adjust for confounding to separate the effect of influenza from those of other seasonal factors. Cocirculation of RSV, together with two meteorological factors of temperature and humidity, are adjusted for as confounders in this study given their association with both health outcomes and influenza [19, 20] . Weekly concentrations of four major ambient air pollutants are also included as confounders based on recent findings on the association between influenza virus and ambient air pollutants [21] .

Flu t and RSV t denote the proxy variables for influenza and RSV, which are weekly proportions of specimens testing positive for influenza or RSV. Three natural cubic spline smoothing functions of s(t, df = 116k), s(Temp t ) and s(Hum t ) are added to adjust for time (t = 1,2,\u2026,574), weekly mean temperature (Temp t ) and relative humidity (Hum t ), where the degrees of freedom (df) of time k ranges from 1 to 10 per year. We used a natural cubic spline with fixed degrees of freedom so that the locations of knots were evenly distributed [23] . NO 2t , SO 2t , O 3t and PM 10t denote the weekly mean concentrations of four air pollutants, respectively. To adjust for the increased mortality during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, we added into the model a dummy variable SARS for the SARS period of week 1-30 of year 2003. Before simulation, we first estimated the coefficients of model (1) by fitting it to the all-cause mortality data during 1998 to 2008 in Hong Kong. The degrees of freedom were fixed to three for weekly temperature and humidity based on our previous experience [17] and to one per year for long term and seasonal trends. Mean mortality for weekm m t was then predicted from this fitted model with the b coefficient for influenza variable Flu t fixed to 0.33 (i.e. mortality increasing 3.3% when the influenza positive proportion increases 10%). The over-dispersion parameter wwas also derived from this model. Because there was no statistical package available for data simulation based on the over-dispersed Poisson distribution, we simulated 500 mortality datasets by assuming that mortality followed a negative binomial distribution, i.e. Y t *NegBin(m t ,h) when h~m t w{1 [24] . Given the uncertainty in degrees of freedom for unmeasured seasonal confounders, we repeated the above simulation process with the degrees of freedom of s(t, df) changing from 1 to 2,3,\u2026, 10 per year. Hence, we got a total of 5000 weekly mortality datasets and 500 for each fixed degrees of freedom for t.",

These rates were separately estimated from the best-fit models chosen by each criterion, and the bias and RMSE were calculated by comparing with the observed admission rates of a pediatric cohort of influenza hospitalization cases. As previously described [17] , this cohort was composed of all the pediatric patients who were recruited from the same two hospitals and diagnosed with influenza infection by immunofluorescence tests and viral culture. Ethics approval for collecting specimens from pediatric patients was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong (EC1880-02).

Two recent studies in Canada and Hong Kong have demonstrated the estimates of influenza-associated hospitalization derived from Poisson regression models reasonably matched the numbers of patients with laboratory confirmed influenza infections [17, 29] . However, it is extremely difficult to obtain the gold standard data on influenza associated deaths to assess the validity of the statistical models, because patients with influenza infection could have died from secondary bacterial infections and exacerbation of their preexisting conditions [30, 31] . Therefore, their presenting problems may not be directly linked to influenza. Moreover, given the potential lag time between severe complications and primary influenza infection, influenza virus might have become undetectable in these patients in the time of admission. Hence recorded influenza deaths could still seriously underestimate the true numbers of deaths due to influenza even if laboratory tests for influenza are intensively conducted. In this study we performed a simulation study to assess the performance of Poisson regression models. The small biases and RMSE of most estimates may give further evidence to support the validity and reliability of Poisson models.",

            "text": "In this study, we adopted a semi-parametric model with smoothing functions to adjust for potential confounders, whereas most of the other studies just used linear terms of confounding variables in their Poisson models [13, 15] . This semi-parametric model is preferred over the traditional parametric model in that it does not require any pre-determined relationships between the independent and dependent variables and thereby allows us to assess both linear and nonlinear relationships. Although we chose natural spline smoothing functions in this study, there are also other smoothing functions available. However, previous studies have found that having a sufficient number of degrees of freedom is more important than the type of smoothing functions for adequate adjustment of confounding in the semi-parametric model [32] . Therefore, in this simulation study, we mainly focused on the determination of degrees of freedom by an appropriate model selection criterion. Among the four criteria under study, GCV consistently provided the smallest biases and RMSE under the different assumptions of seasonal confounders, particularly when this confounder was assumed to have a high seasonal variation. Our findings were robust to the various assumptions of influenza coefficients in simulation and also to the length of study period. Increase of RMSE was observed when the study period was shorten, which is not surprising as using less data points would increase the variation of estimates. All the four model selection criteria were developed under the different schemes. PACF measures the autocorrelation of the residuals, whereas both QAIC and QBIC evaluate the relative goodness of fit of a statistical model by quantifying the relative lost of information when a given model is used to describe the reality. Therefore the latter two reflect the tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity, but QAIC penalizes the number of model parameters to a lesser extent than QBIC does. Unlike other criteria, GCV assesses the model validity by cross-validation, i.e. randomly sampling data as training and test datasets to compare the accuracy and variation of prediction. Our findings that GCV outperforms the other criteria in Poisson models are also in line with previous studies on air pollution [25] .",

            "text": "We chose the best-fit model based on the adequacy of confounding adjustment in terms of providing reliable estimates for influenza effect. Although many seasonal factors could confound influenza effects on mortality, we only focused on the confounding of long term and seasonal trends of mortality in the present study, as this factor affected our estimates to a greater extent than any other confounders according to our previous experience. In this study the best-fit model was selected by minimizing each of the selection criteria, but the magnitude of their difference was not assessed. Some studies suggested that the models selected under the different criteria might perform equally well if the difference between these criteria were small [33, 34] . However, it is not easy and somewhat arbitrary to define the cutoff points for small difference. Burnham and Anderson (2002) developed a set of cutoff points for AIC to select the models with meaningfully different estimates [33] . Similar thresholds for the BIC value were also introduced by Kass and Raftery [34] . However, so far there are no commonly accepted cutoff points for those selection criteria used in our study. Therefore, we did not take into consideration of the difference magnitude between these values, in order to achieve the simplicity and efficiency in the model selection procedure. There are several limitations in our study. First we assessed the parameter uncertainty in Poisson regression models based on the data of subtropical city Hong Kong, where influenza seasonality is less clear than that in the temperate regions [16] . Given the well defined winter peaks of influenza in temperate regions, it can be expected that the data from these regions probably required less complex adjustment for seasonal confounders. Nevertheless, the framework developed in our study can still be applied to a wide range of data. Second, we did not separately estimate the effects of different influenza virus subtypes, although previous studies have demonstrated their difference in excess mortality and mutation frequency [35, 36] . Unfortunately, the virus subtype data during the study period are not available to us. Future studies are needed to assess the performance of these model selection criteria in assessing the disease burden associated with each subtype.",
