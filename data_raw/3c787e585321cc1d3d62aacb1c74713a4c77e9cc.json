            "text": "Hendra virus (HeV) infection in humans is characterized by an influenza like illness, which may progress to pneumonia or encephalitis and lead to death. The pathogenesis of HeV infection is poorly understood, and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research. In this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for HeV infection and found that mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure, with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease. We propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain, possibly along olfactory nerves. This is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals. In our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models. These studies report a new animal model of HeV encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of HeV infection, particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system; investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease; and inform the development of improved treatment options for human patients.",

It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae and is classified within the genus Henipavirus which it shares with one other virus, Nipah virus (NiV). HeV first emerged in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in 1994, where it caused the deaths of one human and fourteen horses [5] . Since then a further thirty four HeV outbreaks have been identified along the mid to north-eastern coast of Australia with infection of five more humans (of whom three died) and numerous horses [6, 7, 8, 9] . Pteropid bats have been identified as the reservoir host [10] , however epidemiological evidence does not support direct bat to human transmission. Horses have been an intermediate host in the transmission of disease to humans in all cases. There are as yet no readily available effective therapies or prophylaxis for HeV infection, either for use in humans or other susceptible animals.",

With bats, the list comprises species from six orders including; Rodentia, Primates, Chiroptera, Cetartiodactyla, Perrisodactyla and Carnivora. The broad species susceptibility is unusual for a member of the family Paramyxoviridae and is attributed largely to the highly conserved nature [17] of the host receptors for the virus, Ephrin B2 and B3 [18, 19] . Despite the possession of relevant receptors [19] , the laboratory mouse, a most useful host on account of their small size, ease of handling, and vast library of available reagents, is reported to be resistant to HeV infection and disease [20] .",

Mice remained clinically well throughout the 21 day study period and, after euthanasia, there was no evidence of infection by gross or histological examination, virus isolation or serology.

All other mice were negative for viral genome in brain tissue. All tissues examined by qPCR including; heart, lung, thymus, pharynx, spleen, kidney, ovary, uterus and mesenteric lymph nodes, were negative for viral genome except in two cases; heart tissue of mouse 5 and lung tissue of mouse 14. In both cases C T values were high at 38.8 and 38.3 respectively, indicating low levels of genome and nearing the cut off for a positive sample set at a C T of 39.6. It is of interest to note that mouse 14 died comparatively early in the course of the study (day 12) and the viral RNA detected in the lungs was consistent with the results of mice that were euthanased in the earlier phases of the subsequent time course trial (described below). Low levels of viral genome (C T 39.2) were also detected in blood samples from one juvenile intranasally exposed mouse, mouse 3. Whether viral genome detected in the above three cases reflected replication at the time of euthanasia or residual genome from earlier transient infection could not be determined.",

In contrast to C57BL/6 mice, lesions and viral antigen were detected in nervous tissues of both symptomatic and asymptomatic animals ( Table 1 ). Two of the three animals that developed clinical disease had encephalitis and viral antigen in the brain: in the third animal (mouse 26) the olfactory bulb was not sampled, and only half the brain was available for histological assessment (the rest was used for qPCR and virus isolation). Four asymptomatic mice (one aged and three juvenile) had encephalitis and viral antigen in brain, with a further two asymptomatic, mice having encephalitis only. Encephalitic lesions and viral antigen deposition in BALB/c mice were also largely confined to neuro-anatomical sites associated with afferent pathways of olfaction ( Table 3 ).

Aged BALB/c mice exposed to HeV by the intranasal route were euthanased at each time point of the following schedule; two mice every 48 hours from 1-14 DPI, two mice every 72 hours from 15 to 23 DPI, and three mice at 28 days PI, or on development of clinical disease according to predetermined humane endpoints defined from the previous study. Whole brain, lung, nasal turbinates and other tissue samples were examined by histology and immunohistochemistry. Lung tissue was further analysed for presence of viral genome and live infectious virus by qPCR and virus isolation, respectively (Table 4) . Mice sampled between days 6 and 14 pi were positive for HeV viral antigen in bronchoalveolar tissue, but antigen deposits were both dense and focal and it was not possible to distinguish on morphologic grounds whether alveolar lining cells, alveolar interstitium, or endothelial cells were involved. Live virus was reisolated from the lungs of mice sampled between 4 and 10 DPI (Table 4 ) consistent with transient infection of the lower respiratory tract after intranasal exposure to HeV. The viral titres detected were comparatively low with a maximum titre (10 2.3 TCID 50) recovered from a mouse on day 6. Interestingly, HeV antigen deposition in lung ( Figure 1D ) was not associated with detectable bronchoalveolitis and pulmonary vasculitis was not identified. In the upper respiratory tract, immunopositive cellssometimes accompanied by small focal necrotising inflammatory lesions (Figure1E and 1F), were detected in olfactory mucosa of mice between 6 to 17 DPI.

Distribution of histologic lesions and viral antigen in the brain of intranasally HeV challenged mice. Viral Antigen is Largely Restricted to Neuronal Cells within the Brain As encephalitis was a major feature of Hendra infection in mice, co-localisation studies were performed using confocal imaging to identify affected cell types within the brain. Perfused brains were collected from three aged BALB/c mice, on DPI 9, 10, and 11 and stained for HeV antigen. Antigen was seen in brain sections from all three mice and with a similar distribution to that observed by immunohistochemistry. Antigen appeared to be present in cells with neuronal morphology only ( Figure 3A) . In order to confirm this observation, sections were labeled with antibodies recognizing neurons (NeuN and NFP1), astrocytes (GFAP) microglia (IBA1) and oligodendrocytes (MBP). Dual labeling of sections of infected mice with these markers and with HeV antibodies indicated that there was no co-localisation of Hendra antigen with GFAP or MBP ( Figure 3B and 3C) . On rare occasions there was evidence of low intensity staining for Hendra viral antigen and microglial markers in single cells ( Figure 3D) . The Hendra protein labelling appeared to be discrete and circumscribed which would be consistent with its presence within a cellular compartment such as lysosomes. Compared with uninfected control tissue, there was reduced labeling of neurons with neuronal markers (NeuN and NFP1) in infected tissue. Therefore, we could not use colocalisation studies with these antibodies to confirm HeV antigen in neurons. In order to explore whether viral proteins could be identified within endothelial cells of capillaries or larger vessels, differential interference contrast (DIC) images were taken of areas of Hendra replication. The capillary lumen and endothelial cell cytoplasm were clearly identified and in no case was Hendra antigen detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells ( Figure 3E ).",

Viral antigen was detected in both the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulbs of intranasally challenged mice as early as day 6 post infection and these two structures are connected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). OSNs are located within the olfactory mucosa of the nasal cavity and project cilia out into the lumen of the nasal cavity to detect odorants [27] . Their axons project to the olfactory bulb of the brain [28] and thereby provide pathogens with a potential route of direct transmission from the nasal cavity to the brain. Within the olfactory bulbs OSNs synapse with mitral, tufted (projection neurons) and peri/juxtaglomerular cells (interneurons) in the glomeruli [29] , and secondary dendrites of the mitral and tufted cells synapse with dendrites of granule cells, which reside largely in the granule cell layer [30] . The trigeminal nerve may provide another possible route of neuroinvasion from the nasal cavity to the glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs. Peripheral peptidergic fibres of the trigeminal nerve innervate the olfactory epithelium and at least some of these fibres will send collaterals to the olfactory bulb (fibres terminate in the glomeruli) [31] en route to the trigeminal ganglion and the contribution of these fibres to viral invasion of the olfactory bulbs requires closer investigation. Viral antigen and lesions were also identified in the pons and medulla in four mice. We suggest that in these cases brain infection occurred via another peripheral neural pathway that enters the CNS at the brainstem such as the trigeminal [27] or the vestibulocochlear nerve [32] and it is of interest that in one animal antigen was localised to the vestibular nuclei of the medulla, which would be consistent with neuroinvasion of the vestibulocochlear nerve [32] after infection arising in the inner ear.",

A particular advantage is that mice are small and comparatively easy to handle at BSL4 and there is an established library of available reagents for neuropathogenetic studies.

More importantly, the pattern of spread of HeV through the brain of mice is best explained by an ability of the virus to employ direct trans-neuronal transmission without concomitant generation of an infectious virion: these observations are of key pathogenetic significance to the human disease. Not only do they provide a possible explanation for failure to reisolate HeV from both sub-acute (I. Smith, unpublished data) and recrudescent [38] human cases of HeV using conventional techniques and in whom there was ample evidence of its ongoing replication, they raise important challenges to optimizing therapeutic interventions. A significant difference in response to infection is seen between aged and juvenile mice where aged mice appear to have a greater propensity to develop clinical disease compared with juvenile animals. A similar trend has been noted for other viral infections of mice, most notably SARS infection. In this case aged mice were susceptible to clinical disease development after challenge with SARS while their juvenile counterparts were not [40] . This observed difference in response to HeV infection between juvenile and aged mice can be used to model and investigate the mechanisms whereby age may affect clinical outcome.",

Our studies show that although intranasally exposed mice develop transient respiratory infection, the low viral titres detected suggest that infection is controlled in its early phase and cleared. Furthermore, this respiratory infection does not progress to a significant systemic disease as occurs in other animal species [2, 3, 13, 15] . Suppression of infection in the absence of evidence for a robust neutralising adaptive immune response suggests an important role for the mouse innate immune system in this process. HeV has been shown to employ various strategies to evade clearance and control by the innate immune system [43] and we suggest that in the mouse such strategies are rendered ineffective. It will be important in future research to elucidate the mechanism by which mice eliminate respiratory infection and resist systemic disease in order to guide the development of therapeutics that might mimic the process.",

            "text": "In summary, this paper reports three novel observations. Firstly, mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure with aged animals reliably developing encephalitic disease. Their small size and ease of handling, as well as the vast range of biological reagents available for use in the species, render them highly valuable infection models for HeV encephalitis. Secondly, our data strongly support a role for not only anterograde neuroinvasion along sensory neurones but also transneuronal viral spread of HeV within the brain. This finding is of particular importance as infection may be established within the nervous system before current systemic treatments are able to be delivered across the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, mice are resistant to systemic vasculitis and fulminating HeV disease, the mechanisms of which can be explored with therapeutic potential. These findings provide a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in the field and have opened up new areas of investigation, from which significant understanding and further research can arise of benefit to humans as well as animals.",

Animals were allowed 7 days to acclimatise before challenge and were implanted with a subcutaneous temperature chip 5 days prior to challenge. For this procedure and all others requiring restraint for manipulations, an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75mg/ kg; Ketamil; Ilium, Smithfield, Australia) and medetomidine (10mg/kg; Domitor; Novartis, Pendle Hill, Australia) was used to induce anaesthesia.
