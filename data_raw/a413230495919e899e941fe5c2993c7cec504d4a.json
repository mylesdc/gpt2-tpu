            "text": "The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) comprises eight RNA segments (vRNA) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5\u2032-vRNA. In contrast, 3\u2032-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5\u2032-vRNA binding. Our results provide further evidence for a step-wise assembly of IAV structural components, regulated by nuclear transport mechanisms and host factor binding.",

The viral RNA (vRNA) is divided into 8 segments that encode for a total of 10 core proteins and a few additional accessory proteins. Every vRNA segment is coated by numerous nucleoprotein (NP) units and by one RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) complex composed of PA (716 aa for influenza A virus (IAV) strains), PB1 (756 aa for IAV strains) and PB2 (757aa for IAV strains). The RdRp binds to the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-terminal extremities of the vRNA which acts as a promoter region 1-3 . The macromolecular assembly between the vRNA, NP and the RdRp forms the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RdRp performs both replication and transcription of the vRNA genome in the nucleus of the cell. As such, the RdRp can produce either cRNA/vRNA through de novo replication or viral mRNA through \"cap snatching\" transcription 4 . The factors regulating the switch from a transcriptive to a replicative RdRp remain to be characterised.",

Nonetheless, a cryo-EM reconstruction was recently obtained of a truncated influenza A/H5N1 polymerase 13 . In the present article, we identify PB2 as the main bottleneck hampering complete recombinant polymerase expression in our insect cells expression system. Moreover, we present the characterisation of several constructs of human-IAV RdRp, including the biologically relevant PA-PB1 heterodimer in solution. The titration measurements against the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-vRNA promoters show a strong sub-nanomolar affinity of the PA-PB1 heterodimer towards the 5\u2032-vRNA whereas the specific binding of the 3\u2032-vRNA requires the presence of PB2. By applying our co-expression strategy, we show that the previously proposed PA-PB1-RanBP5 import complex can be purified, which we characterise using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Biochemical analysis of this complex reveals a role for RanBP5 in hindering 5\u2032-vRNA binding. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a cellular RdRp assembly pathway following a sequential and conditional process of assembly.",

            "text": "PB2 is a key limiting factor for recombinant expression of the heterotrimer. Polyproteins are naturally used by certain viruses to structure their proteome 14, 15 . Recombinant polyproteins mimicking viral polyproteins have recently emerged as a powerful tool to express protein complexes for functional characterisation as well as structural determination (reviewed in 16 ) . Using this strategy 17 , soluble and active heterotrimeric RNAdependent RNA-polymerases of influenza B virus (IBV) and bat influenza A (bat-IAV) virus could be produced, crystallized and the structure determined at high resolution 5, 6 . We have applied a similar strategy to the RdRp of two human-IAV strains, A/Victoria/3/1975(H3N2) and the highly pathogenic A/Viet-Nam/1203/2004(H5N1). The three genes of each heterotrimeric complex were combined with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) in a single large open reading frame (ORF). Each gene was separated by a DNA sequence encoding for a peptide segment comprising a short serine/glycine linker and a TEV protease cleavage site ( Fig. 1a and supplementary Figure 1 ). The constructs were optimized for recombinant expression in insect Deposits feature total lysate after freeze/thaw (T), supernatant after centrifugation (S), resin flow through (Ft) and the primary elution fraction (E). After migration on a 12% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred on PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies targeting human-IAV PB2 (rabbit IgG) and human-IAV PB1 (mouse IgG) have been used. Revelation was performed with secondary goat antibodies coupled with Alexa Fluor 532 (\u03bb exi = 632 nm, \u03bb emi = 647 nm) and Alexa Fluor 633 (\u03bb exi = 531 nm, \u03bb emi = 554 nm) targeting mouse and rabbit H + L domains respectively, using a Typhoon Trio imaging system (GE Healthcare). After integration of the raw data, PB1 and PB2 revelation are visible in red and green respectively. Black and white signal of PB2 is also shown (bottom) to highlight the PB2 truncations. The upper bands appearing in green/yellow, correspond to unprocessed polyproteins.",

During expression, the TEV protease cleaves the polyprotein co-translationally, resulting in a stoichiometric assembly of the RdRp that can then be selectively purified using an affinity nickel resin. The production of the polyprotein is monitored using the fluorescence of two reporter proteins: CFP encoded within the polyprotein reports directly on recombinant protein yield, while YFP, integrated in the baculovirus genome, monitors virus performance 19 . The ratio of YFP/CFP in our system is a highly useful criterion to determine recombinant polyprotein translation efficacy of the different constructs. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained with all constructs tested. Several attempts were made to express the H3N2 polymerase heterotrimer (construct number 12, Table 1 ). Although YFP and CFP can be detected and quantified, CFP values were extremely low compared to YFP with a YFP/CFP ratio of 50, the highest observed for any polyprotein constructs that we expressed. No clear bands were observed on western blot using specific PA, PB1 and PB2 antibodies. Similar results were obtained with the H5N1 RdRp polyprotein, indicating failure of these recombinant expression experiments for these full-length IAV heterotrimeric polymerases. As a comparison, using the same strategy, the YFP/CFP ratio for the expression of IBV or Bat-IAV heterotrimer was close to 20, similar to the ratios we obtained for the expressions of constructs 13 and 15 (i.e. without most of PB2).",

These were PB2(1-36) 20 , PB2(1-116) 21 and based on the cap-binding domain 22 , PB2(322-483). Expression and purification experiments were undertaken on constructs 15, 17 and 18, all of which all have full-length PA, PB1 and truncations of PB2 extending to residues 116, 320 and 483 respectively (Fig. 1b) . As the PB2 extension increases beyond residue 116, we observed a loss of expression of the polyprotein, thus identifying a critical region in PB2 that limits yield. This can first of all be observed through the monitoring of YFP/CFP reporter genes during expression (Fig. 1c) . YFP fluorescence values reach a similar plateau for all constructs whereas CFP values are reduced significantly for constructs 17 and 18. Moreover, after nickel resin pull-down on lysates from an equal amount of cells, we observed by western blot (Fig. 1d ) decreased intensity bands of not only PB2 but also PB1, indicative of an overall expression loss. Polyprotein size increase alone could not explain the reduced expression because other control constructs (19 and 20) with additional protein sequences beyond PB2 residue 116 conserve lower YFP/CFP ratios. Furthermore, replacing the PB2(1-116) by another large protein such as RanBP5 (residues 1-1115) generates a construct with a lower YFP/CFP ratio than construct 15. The analysis of the amino acids sequences of PB2 does not provide more indication on the real nature of this phenomenon (supplementary Figure 2 ). To determine whether this \"loss-of-expression\" phenomenon results from our polyprotein expression strategy, which combines PA-PB1 and PB2 in one ORF, we generated a MultiBac baculovirus co-expressing a PA-PB1 fusion and PB2 from an independent expression cassette 23 . This strategy also resulted in high YFP/CFP ratios (\u2265 35), even though the CFP gene was only fused to PA-PB1. These results identify PB2, especially when extended beyond the residue 116, as the bottleneck for expression of complete human-IAV RdRp.",

In order to identify a minimal active core of the human-IAV polymerase, we have systematically dissected the heterotrimeric complex for further characterisation using the polyprotein strategy. The expression of PA-PB1 increases significantly when PB2 is totally removed (compare constructs 1 and 13/15; Table 1 ). The same observation is made after removing the endonuclease domain (i.e. PA-Nter; compare constructs 14 and 13/15). After purification, PA-PB1 forms homogeneous monomeric and stable particles (Fig. 2b) whereas the complexes with PB2 (constructs 15 and 16) give rise to dimers in solution (Fig. 2a) . The dimers are stable enough to withstand salt concentrations up to 2 M NaCl during purification, but the SEC elution peaks are broad suggesting that the oligomerization process is quite dynamic. By adding vRNA promoter-like molecules (e.g. the IAV panhandle) 24 , we found that the dimers dissociated into monomeric RNA:protein complexes. We were able to show that the truncated PA-PB1 (construct 1) and the PA-PB1-PB2 (construct 14) exhibit expected polymerase activities. The endonuclease activity is similar to that of the isolated PA-Nter domain (supplementary Figure 3 ), can be inhibited by the same point mutation (i.e. PA-E80A) or compound (i.e. DPBA) and shows comparable dependency on manganese 25, 26 . The constructs are also functional in RNA synthesis. Upon addition of a mixture of IAV panhandle, NTPs and [\u03b1 -32 P]-UTP, both truncated PA-PB1 and PA-PB1-PB2 are able to generate an 80-nucleotide long product plus other minor products in absence or in presence of ApG (supplementary Figure 4) .",

The heterodimer PA-PB1 can be purified with or without the N-terminal domain of PA (i.e. PA-Nter; compare constructs 1 and 2). However, as soon as the PA-hinge (residues 200-260) is removed, PB1 becomes insoluble. This implies that the PA-hinge linking the Nter-and Cter-domains of PA is crucial for the stability of PB1. However, it is not sufficient in itself since the C-terminal region of PA also interacts with the N-terminal part of PB1 27,28 and cannot be deleted either (compare constructs 2 and 5 to 11). PB1 can be shortened on its C-terminus but when purifying the construct 4 (i.e. PB1 until amino acid 560), only PA-Cter remains soluble. Thus, the minimal construct required to obtain soluble PB1 is construct 3 with PA from 197 to 716 and PB1 from 1 to 660.

            "text": "We used fluorescence anisotropy to measure the interaction between our truncated polymerase constructs and the conserved vRNA ends by following the fluorescence polarization increase of a fluorescently labelled RNA when it binds the polymerase. For this purpose, we used 5\u2032-vRNAp and 3\u2032-vRNAp, both labelled with fluorescein amidite (FAM) at the opposite extremity of the putative interaction, i.e. at the 3\u2032-end for the 5\u2032-vRNAp and vice versa ( Fig. 3 and Table 2 ). At 300 mM NaCl, the Kd for the 5\u2032-vRNAp are similar (sub-nanomolar) for both constructs 1 and 14, whereas for the 3\u2032-vRNAp, a Kd of 36 nM for the construct with PB2 is obtained (Fig. 3a ) and no binding was observed for the construct without PB2 (Fig. 3c ). As the estimated Kd for the 5\u2032-end was in a range below the working concentration and beyond the sensitivity limit of the fluorescence anisotropy measurement, another method was required to determine the 5\u2032-vRNAp affinity. Filter binding assays (FBA) were then therefore used for precise Kd determination (Fig. 3b) . With the corresponding radioactive probes, we found values of 0.2-0.4 nM for the 5\u2032-end. For the 3\u2032-end, the Kd was 100-fold higher and critically dependent on the presence of PB2. Salt concentration is also an important parameter. We show different binding characteristics at 150 and 300 mM NaCl of the PA-PB1 towards different RNAs. The Kd value of PA-PB1 for the 5\u2032-end remains sub-nanomolar in the range of 150 to 300 mM NaCl. In contrast, at 150 mM NaCl, 3\u2032-vRNAp binds to PA-PB1 with the same affinity than for a poly-UC (Fig. 3c) , and so is non-specific. All relevant titrations were performed at 300 mM NaCl to prevent non-specific affinity measurements. Recently published affinity data 33 working at 500 mM NaCl likewise consistent with very high affinity of the 5\u2032-vRNAp towards IAV polymerase but this study failed to measure 3\u2032-vRNAp binding within the nanomolar range, indicating that 3\u2032-vRNAp binding is also tightly influenced by salt concentration. Whereas PB2 and NP use importins-\u03b1 9,34-37 , PA and PB1 are conjointly imported as a preformed heterodimeric submodule by the importin-\u03b2 RanBP5 10, 12, 38 . Having confirmed the existence of a stable PA-PB1 complex we sought to demonstrate its interaction with RanPB5. The human IPO5 gene which encodes for RanBP5, was expressed in insect cells. After purification, RanBP5 forms a homogeneous monomeric sample (Fig. 2c ) that has been used in mixing experiments with freshly purified PA-PB1(1-686) followed by SEC-MALLS-RI experiments. The two samples were mixed in stoichiometric ratio and incubated before size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Both RanBP5 and PA-PB1(1-686) were eluted in the same single peak, but MALLS-RI indicated a molecular weight corresponding of a mixture rather than a stable ternary complex (supplementary Figure 6 ). We then attempted to produce a PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 heterotrimer by the self-processing polyprotein strategy. A long ORF encoding for the trimeric complex was created by inserting the IPO5 gene downstream of the PB1(1-686) coding sequence (Table 1, construct 21) . Remarkably, from this polyprotein construct, PA-PB1 co-purifies with RanBP5, forming a homogeneous and stable heterotrimer (Fig. 2d) . (Fig. 4a) shows a visually adequate correlation with the CRYSOL curve which uses the bat-IAV polymerase structure (PDB id: 4WSB) as a model. To evaluate the statistical similarity between experimental intensities and those computed from a model has been derived. The high chi 2 values are observed for this dataset, due to a noisy SAXS curve. A slight deviation of the fit is observed above a q range of 0.8 nm \u22121 , suggesting conformational differences between the scattering curve and the crystal structure coordinates. Ab-initio modelling was performed using 15 DAMMIF models which were averaged by DAMAVER. Averaged model correlation with the diffusion curve was then checked using the damstart file as a starting envelope for DAMMIN. The polymerase DAMAVER envelope (Fig. 4a) appears as a pear shaped structure in which the homologous model can be fitted. Additional envelope volume is visible close to the endonuclease domain, implying that it adopts multiple conformations in solution.",

MONSA builds ab initio shapes using the scattering curves for complexes together with those of their individual components 41 . MONSA was used to perform the ab-initio modelling of the complex PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 (supplementary Figure 8) . It separately uses the PA-PB1(1-686) and RanBP5 diffusion curves (Fig. 4a,b) in combination with that of PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 to propose a consensus dual envelope (Fig. 4c) . Model fitting was performed against the three experimental curves and matches all 3 curves with similar quality. With this ab-initio modelling we also find a comparable envelope for PA-PB1(1-686) like the one produced with DAMMIF/DAMAVER. RanBP5 on the other hand displays a different envelope suggesting conformational differences between the unbound and bound forms of RanBP5. The model suggests a close interaction between the two proteins, RanBP5 (violet envelope) interacts with PA-PB1(1-686) (grey envelope), suggesting molecular contacts well beyond those of the proposed PB1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing domain, which the crystal structure shows is a mobile and solvent exposed \u03b2 -ribbon 6 . This model further supports the hypothesis that RanBP5 may play a chaperone function for PA-PB1 prior to assembly with PB2 in the nucleus to complete the polymerase.",

In marked contrast and unexpectedly, efficient expression of active full-length human or avian IAV polymerase at yields high enough for structural studies has not been reported to date, irrespective of the method used. Our studies identify PB2, and notably residues 120 to 250 as responsible for this poor expression. Interestingly, attempts by a different research group to reconstitute a full IAV polymerase (e.g. full IAV polymerase expression/purification for structural studies) likewise failed beyond the N-terminal PB1 interacting domain of PB2 13 . Furthermore, the recent bat-IAV, IBV and ICV RdRp crystal structures have shown that PB2 can adopt a plethora of conformations, demonstrating how dynamic PB2 is within the heterotrimer [5] [6] [7] 42, 43 . The reason why PB2 hinders polyprotein expression is not clear at the moment. We speculate that the extended fold of the PB2 region 1-250 is unstable unless bound to one side of PB1 5,6 and thus may require chaperones to maintain its stability prior to assembly onto PA-PB1. Of note, Hsp90 has been shown to stimulate influenza virus RNA synthesis 44 and the nuclear import of the subunits 35 . Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitors reduce influenza virus replication in cell culture 45 . We have shown previously that provision of co-factors in trans can ameliorate the quality and quantity of target proteins expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system 46, 47 . Provision of Hsp90 and the other chaperones, within the polyprotein or in trans on the baculovirus backbone, may provide a powerful handle to overcome the bottleneck of human-AIV polymerase production. Furthermore, although the cellular context between viral infection and the expression of recombinant proteins is different, it cannot be excluded that the polyprotein interferes with the cellular innate immunity. IAV RdRp, and PB2 in particular, has been shown to regulate host anti-viral response through the binding to IPS-1 and the inhibition of interferon \u03b2 production 48 .",

PA-PB1 can specifically bind to the 5\u2032-vRNAp with sub-nanomolar affinity in solution. In contrast, 3\u2032-vRNAp binding requires the presence of PB2 and is within the low nanomolar range, indicating a much stronger preference of the polymerase towards the 5\u2032-vRNAp. These results are consistent with the high-resolution crystal structures in which the 5\u2032-vRNAp binding site is located between the PA and PB1 subunits 5,6 .

Purification of stoichiometric complexes using the polyprotein strategy confirms that PA-PB1 can exist as a preformed and stable submodule, independently of additional host factors, with PA acting as a putative \"chaperone\" for PB1. Our data also shows that PA-PB1 is functional in RNA synthesis, which has interesting physiological implications. Moreover, we demonstrate here that the PA-PB1(1-686) heterodimer can assemble with RanBP5 into a stable, heterotrimeric complex that can be purified in vitro. This likely corresponds to the import complex for these two subunits, although other chaperones such as HSP90 may be co-imported 35 . In contrast to PA-PB1 with RanBP5, we failed to reconstitute a binary PB2-importin-\u03b1 complex using the polyprotein strategy even though functional and structural data show that PB2 nuclear import depends on the importin-\u03b1 pathway, through a direct interaction between the PB2 C-terminal domain that contains the NLS 8, 9 . This is probably partly due to an inherent instability of isolated IAV PB2 in insect cells but could also reflect the lack of sufficient chaperones, co-chaperones or other unidentified factors that stabilise PB2. Furthermore, cytoplasmic expression of PB2 appears to destabilise many cellular processes 50, 51 . We also still do not know the reason for the difference in the import pathway usage between the PA-PB1 submodule and PB2. The lack of high expression levels of fully assembled PA-PB1-PB2 heterotrimers unfortunately currently limits our efforts to elucidate the structure of the complete human IAV polymerase at atomic resolution. Nevertheless, docking of bat-IAV and IBV crystal structures into the PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 SAXS envelope suggests that assembly of PB2 onto the PA-PB1-RanBP5 complex might be possible, based on steric considerations. Indeed RanBP5 could even facilitate trimer assembly perhaps concomitantly with Ran-dependent dissociation from PA-PB1. In contrast, RanBP5 profoundly affects the ability of PA-PB1 to bind vRNA. We show that whereas the 5\u2032-vRNA is specifically recognized by PA-PB1 with high affinity, this is abolished in the ternary complex with RanBP5. This again suggests that RanBP5 disassociation may be coupled to assembly of the polymerase with the promoter RNA. In any case, only when PB2 associates is the polymerase able to associate with the 3\u2032-vRNA end, consistent with the crystal structures 5, 6 . But surprisingly, the affinity of the heterotrimer for 3\u2032-vRNA is in the same order of magnitude than the affinity of NP for RNA substrates (Table 2) , revealing a potential competition between the complete polymerase heterotrimer and the nucleoprotein.",

Functional studies on IAV RdRp reveal that vRNAp promoter binding is completely abolished when PA-PB1(1-686) is bound to RanBP5, suggesting a possible role for RanBP5 in maintaining PA-PB1 in an inactive form during nuclear import. This discovery holds a promise for influenza research as it provides a novel point of therapeutic intervention for targeting and inhibiting influenza virus during assembly of its active components.

The experimental setup consists of a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system connected to an analytical S200 increase column (5/150 GL, GE Healthcare) followed downstream by the SAXS sample capillary. SAXS measurements were performed every second with a Pilatus 1 M detector at distance of 2.87 m allowing a q range of 0.03 to 4.5 nm with a wavelength of 0.01 nm.
