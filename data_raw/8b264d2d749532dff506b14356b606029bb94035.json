            "text": "systems, often without robust biosecurity (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2016; Webster, 2004) . Live bird markets (LBMs) are a traditional aspect of these systems that facilitate the storage and sale of live poultry including chickens, ducks, quail and pigeons. As a consequence, LBMs play a significant role in the maintenance and spread of AIVs and thus pose a zoonotic risk to poultry workers and consumers, and to temporary workers enlisted during stamping out programmes (Bridges et al., 2002; Mounts et al., 1999) . LBMs have been a primary target for AIV control strategies; during a zoonotic outbreak of H7N9 in China in 2013, closure of LBMs was shown to be remarkably effective in reducing the risk of human infection by up to 99% (Yu et al., 2014) . Control strategies in LBMs have also been shown to significantly reduce AIV detection in chickens: the most effective strategies include monthly rest days that involve routine market closure followed by slaughter of unsold poultry, a ban to the sale of live quail and a ban to overnight storage of live poultry (Kung et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2012) . However, although rest days are effective at breaking the viral amplification cycle in LBMs, they do not prevent reintroduction of virus. Indeed, rest days/nights are an important component of long-term AIV control but are not sufficient alone to eliminate infection (Kung et al., 2003) . Furthermore, risk factor studies in LBMs have shown that having a greater variety of poultry species, including ducks being sold alongside other species, having poor sanitary conditions, storing poultry in floor pens instead of cages and having \u22651 wholesaler trading in LBMs, all increase the odds of having AIV-infected poultry and/or having AIV-contaminated environments (Kim et al., 2018; Kirunda et al., 2015; Santhia et al., 2009; Sayeed et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018) .",

To do this, we utilized the 12 Vietnamese H9N2 viruses which we had full-genome sequence data for and concatenated their open reading frames. The genetic distance between any two of the 12 fully sequenced H9N2 isolates decreased if these two isolates originated from the same LBM (Mantel test, r = \u2212.41, p = .004), or sampled chickens were sourced in the same province (r = \u2212.37, p = .031) (see Table S1 for genotype distribution between sampled LBM and province source). In the light of this, we were able to classify viruses into seven different sub-genotypes using a > 98% nucleotide difference cut-off for each gene segment (for viruses where full-genome sequencing data were available) ( Figure 2 ). From this, we could see that several strains which originated from the same LBM were also grouped into the same genotype; genotype VN4 contained three viruses from LBM Pho Hien, and genotype VN5 contained three viruses from LBM Do. HA and NP genes had the greatest maximum nucleotide pairwise distance with 6.7% and 6.9%, respectively, followed by NS with 5.7%, NA with 5%, PB1 with 4%, PB2 with 3.9%, M with 1.6% and PA with 1.5%.",

As such, traders are classified as retailers or wholesalers based on who they primarily sell poultry to; retailers primarily sell directly to consumers, whereas wholesalers primarily sell to other poultry vendors within the trading network. In our study, we show retailers experienced higher odds of infection due to their trading practices. The retailers in our study were those who sourced their birds from middlemen, sold a relatively small volume of chickens and primarily sold directly to consumers. The risk factors associated with influenza virus A infection in chickens, selling only to consumers and buying from middlemen, can therefore be linked to retailers, which highlights their potential role in disseminating virus through the poultry trade network. In contrast, the wholesalers in our study were those who sourced from large commercial farms, sold a large volume of chickens and primarily sold to other vendors.",

Vendors who have strong connections to a network of contacts operating in and around LBMs would be expected to have a more pronounced role in disseminating AIVs, whereas vendors holding a loose link to a network of contacts may have a reduced impact on AIV dissemination (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2016) . Thus, middlemen are mobile, highly connected poultry traders that travel between farms and LBMs to purchase and sell birds, mixing poultry from many different sources. As a consequence, they facilitate a network of LBMs that are tractable to the circulation of influenza viruses (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2013 (Fourni\u00e9 et al., , 2012 . The identification of middlemen supplying poultry to traders as a risk factor for influenza virus infection could be explained by their mobility and propensity to mix poultry, and their high connectivity to the poultry trade network. Likewise, retailers could be associated with higher odds of infection because they may purchase birds that have \"changed hands\" multiple times, promoting the amount of time spent by birds within the trade network and facilitating the mixing of birds from different sources. All the LBMs included in this study were open seven days a week, which would allow for greater connectivity between traders as they have more opportunity to interact at LBMs, potentially increasing the risk posed by retailers in particular.",

Duck farming often involves raising and storing ducks in open bodies of water, which introduces the risk for wild waterfowl to mix with farmed ducks and transmit influenza viruses. In addition, studies have shown longer virus shedding times for LPAI-infected ducks, up to 11.5 days, compared with LPAI-infected chickens, up to 6 days (H\u00e9naux & Samuel, 2011; James et al., 2016). Therefore, poultry traders with larger numbers of unsold ducks could increase the transmission window for ducks to infect chickens, especially as unsold ducks may have repeated exposures to wild waterfowl when traders store unsold ducks at home. Effective control of avian influenza requires understanding risk factors associated with contamination of all aspects of poultry production. Contamination of the environment in LBMs and of utensils used for handling live and slaughtered poultry has been well documented; risk factors associated with environmental contamination of LBMs include \"in-house\" poultry slaughtering, and their location in regions which see great chicken density and poultry-related activity",

However, amino acid diversity at residue 180 of the HA protein could play an important role in zoonotic potential. Previously, we and others have shown that H9N2 viruses carrying the A180T/V substitution gain the ability to bind to human-like receptor analogues(Sealy et al., 2019;Teng et al., 2016;Yang et al., 2017). The A180T/V substitution also enhances binding avidity towards avianlike receptor analogues, which can attenuate virus replication in vitro; however, the impact of this mutation in conjunction with a NA stalk deletion is currently unknown.Finally, vaccination against H9N2 has not been adopted in Vietnam; however, vaccination programmes against H5 are a key component of outbreak response measures",

Likewise, we may have received feedback on poultry trading practices from the same vendors multiple times over the sampling period. However, the infection status of unsold chickens and associated poultry trading practices of a vendor may have changed as the week progressed, that is chickens may have been free of AIV infection at the start of the sampling week, but by day 2 or day 3, the chickens of the repeatedly sampled poultry trader may have become AIV-positive.
