            "text": "The elderly population infected with HIV-1 is often characterized by the rapid AIDS progression and poor treatment outcome, possibly because of immunosenescence resulting from both HIV infection and aging. However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. Here, we studied 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques (ChRM) over the course of three months after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 infection. Old ChRM showed a higher risk of accelerated AIDS development than did young macaques, owing to rapidly elevated plasma viral loads and decreased levels of CD4 + T cells. The low frequency of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells before infection was strongly predictive of an increased disease progression, whereas the severe depletion of CD4 + T cells and the rapid proliferation of na\u00efve lymphocytes accelerated the exhaustion of na\u00efve lymphocytes in old ChRM. Moreover, in old ChRM, a robust innate host response with defective regulation was associated with a compensation for na\u00efve T cell depletion and a high level of immune activation. Therefore, we suggest that immunosenescence plays an important role in the accelerated AIDS progression in elderly individuals and that SIV-infected old ChRM may be a favorable model for studying AIDS pathogenesis and researching therapies for elderly AIDS patients.",

Because an increased risk of HIV infection has been found in the elderly population, HIV-1-infected elderly patients have drawn great attention recently 1 . In 2015, more than half of all HIV-1-infected individuals in the USA were over 50 years of age, and it has been predicted that this percentage will increase to 70% by 2020 2 .

            "text": "Increasing evidence suggests that a variety of HIV infection-induced immunologic alterations are similar to those seen in uninfected elderly people. Most of these alterations often exhibit age-related abnormalities in adaptive immunity, including an accelerated decrease in T-cell renewal and an increase in B-cell exhaustion, an accumulation of terminally differentiated memory cells with poor proliferative responses, a shortened replication history, constricted diversity within the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire and decreased responsiveness to vaccines. These outcomes ultimately result in a general decline in immunity, thus gradually giving rise to immunosenescence 4-6 . Immunosenescence is often characterized by thymic involution and reduced output and function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), thus resulting in a poor response to vaccination and an increased susceptibility to infection in the elderly 7, 8 . According to the Swedish OCTO and NONA immune longitudinal studies, immune risk profiles (IRP) associated with low-grade inflammation, including an inverse ratio of CD4/CD8, a reduction in B cells, the depletion of na\u00efve T cells, an increased frequency of well \u2212 differentiated CD28 \u2212 CD57 + T cells and the expansion of CMV-specific oligoclonal cells, have strong associations with morbidity and mortality in the elderly 9, 10 . Several studies have demonstrated that classical markers of immunosenescence such as a high frequency CD28 \u2212 T cells and CD31 \u2212 na\u00efve T cells strongly predict subsequent disease progression, less CD4 + T cell restoration after 2 years of treatment and poor responsiveness to vaccination after ART independent of other predictors in HIV-1+ patients [11] [12] [13] . Thus, immunosenescence due to both HIV-1 infection and aging may explain the accelerated development of AIDS and poor outcomes in older HIV-1-infected patients.",

Fortunately, Asian macaques such as rhesus macaques (RM) and pigtailed macaques (PTM) infected with multiple SIV strains or related artificial chimeras (HSIV/SHIV) are desirable animal models to study the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS as well as its prevention and treatment 14 . Furthermore, existing evidence indicates that aged RM may serve as a translational model for immunosenescence research, because their immune system ages in a manner that is similar to the process in humans [15] [16] [17] . Recent studies have detected a high level of viral replication in aged RM with severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) or influenza due to increased inflamm-aging 18, 19 . Surprisingly, some AIDS cases have even been found in SIV-infected natural hosts that are generally regarded as non-pathogenic models and that are primarily aged animals 20 . It has been suggested that aged non-human primates have a high susceptibility to various types of infections. Our previous studies have revealed that ChRM act either as an excellent model for HIV-1 infection in humans or as a favorable model to research the mechanisms of immunosenescence [21] [22] [23] . Thus, there are reasons for believing that old ChRM infected with SIV might be a favorable model to study the pathogenesis and treatment of the HIV-1-infected elderly population. In this study, we compared the immunological, virological and gene-expression dynamics between young and old ChRM during early SIVmac239 infection to identify the characteristics of elderly AIDS patients and to explore the interactions between immunosenescence and HIV/SIV infection.",

To explore the pathogenesis of acute HIV infection in elderly patients, we compared 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239 in the first 3 months after infection. Thirty-five days post-infection (dpi), 4 old macaques without the Mamu-B*03, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 alleles gradually died of severe diarrhea and wasting disease even in spite of antibiotic treatment, whereas 4 young macaques lacking the protective MHC class I alleles remained alive during early infection ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary  Table S1 ). To determine whether this increased risk of death was associated with a high level of viremia, we monitored the plasma viral loads of all of the animals. Similarly to the 9.63 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml plasma in the young animals, a mean peak viral load of 1.58 \u00d7 10 7 copies/ml plasma was found in the acute phase in the old ChRM (P = 0.6468). Throughout the infection, no significant differences in viral load were detected between the young and old groups (Fig. 1b) . However, the old macaques reached their peak earlier, at 10 or 14 dpi, compared with the delayed peak at 14 or 21 dpi in the young macaques (P = 0.0154) (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, in contrast to the survivors, the macaques that died displayed a more robust viral replication as indicated by higher viral loads from 35 dpi to death ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Because chronic diarrhea induced by increased intestinal permeability occurred during the progression of SIV infection 24 , it is conceivable that old ChRM may have a higher risk of rapid progression of AIDS.",

According to the data from studies of pathogenic SIV infection and aging in rhesus macaques, we chose 46 innate immune genes that were likely to be differentially expressed between young and old SIV-infected macaques 17, 29 . These genes are involved in the interferon (IFN) and pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathways. We also measured the mRNA expression levels of chemokine and regulatory genes in PBMCs. Thirty genes that were significantly up-regulated with differential expression between the age groups were identified by ANOVA ( Supplementary  Fig. S4) . A KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that these genes mainly participate in the antiviral response and interact closely with one another; they also partially represent the innate host response ( Supplementary  Fig. S5 ).",

Subsequently, the mRNA expression decreased to intermediate levels and was distinct in the different age groups at 14, 28 and 42 dpi. At 84 dpi, the expression of partial genes had already declined to baseline levels in both young and old ChRM. These genes were further organized into three clusters by K-means clustering. Genes within cluster 1 (IFNB1 and CCL2) were rapidly up-regulated to a greater extent at 7 dpi in the young ChRM and decreased to less than twice the baseline in the old ChRM after 28 dpi. Within cluster 2, RIGI, a cytoplasmic sensor of viral RNA, and 10 interferon-simulated genes (ISG) were more highly induced in the old ChRM than in the young macaques during the acute phase. The expression characteristics of the genes within cluster 3 were more complex. SOCS1, the only differentially expressed gene among the 7 regulators in this study, was significantly down-regulated in the old ChRM compared with the young ChRM. CCL5, IFI16 and TLR7 were evaluated only in old ChRM. Other genes within cluster 3 were significantly induced to a level more than twice the baseline only at 10 dpi in the young macaques; this induction occurred much earlier (at 7 dpi) and more robustly in the old ChRM during the acute phase (Fig. 6b) .",

In our study, the plasma viral loads in old ChRM were also at a moderate peak and low set-point level during early infection and rapidly rose to peak levels and remained high as the infection progressed. However, the dynamics of the CD4 + T cells in old ChRM was more similar to that of SIV-infected PTM, which are characterized by a fast progression with a rapid and complete of loss CD4 + T cells within 60 weeks after infection 31 . Furthermore, old ChRM had a low level of B cells, as is also seen in chronic HIV-1infection 6 . Because fewer CD4 + T cells and B cells and the inversion of CD4/CD8 are strong predictors of mortality and morbidity in old individuals 9 , it is not surprising that old ChRM showed a high risk of fast progression during early infection.",

Furthermore, a previous report has demonstrated that the expression of Ki67 is elevated in peripheral na\u00efve T cells from old rhesus macaques, thus partially representing a dramatic increase in homeostatic turnover and a loss of the na\u00efve T-cell pool 34 . Together with the decrease in na\u00efve lymphocytes in old ChRM and the strong association between Ki67 + na\u00efve T cells and disease progression, these observations suggest that the na\u00efve lymphocytes in old ChRM have a rapid turnover and exhaustion, thereby probably contributing to disease progression.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have found that the loss of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells occurs fairly early during HIV-1 infection and precedes the loss of immune homeostasis and AIDS progression. Thus, a na\u00efve T-cell subset may play an important role in delaying HIV progression [35] [36] [37] . In our study, the low frequency of na\u00efve T cells before infection in ChRM predicted a robust immune activation and rapid SIV progression. Moreover, in accordance with the robust turnover in the na\u00efve subset, the rapid decrease in na\u00efve CD4 + T cell and na\u00efve B cell numbers that was induced by SIVmac239 infection in old ChRM may have contributed to the gradual absence of their immune defense. Similarly to what has been shown in elderly individuals, there is some evidence that direct HIV infection and HIV-induced immune activation destroy the microenvironments supporting immune renewal, reduce The gene expression data from old ChRM displayed a rapid, strong and persistent interferon and pathogen recognition response to SIVmac239. Notably, distinct from nonpathogenic SIV infection with a transient elevated expression of ISGs in the acute phase, the expression of ISGs is persistently higher in HIV-infected individuals and SIVmac239-infected macaques 29, 41 . This phenomenon was also seen in the young and especially in the old ChRM. Other studies have also found that most ISGs are significantly elevated in old rhesus macaques infected with various viruses such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV. This elevation is due to the highly activated upstream NF-\u03baB transcription factor, primarily because of increased viral replication and inflammation 18, 19 . Recent studies have demonstrated that a sufficient type I interferon (IFN-I) response during acute infection suppresses the depletion of CD4 + T cells, SIV transmission and active HSCs. However, the persistent activation of the IFN response after acute SIV infection may functionally impair HSCs with hematopoietic defects and decrease the protection from viruses caused by IFN desensitization 42, 43 . Interestingly, SOCS1, which encodes a member of cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling that act as modulators of IFN-\u03b3 action (ENTREZ gene summary), was slightly induced by SIVmac239 in ChRM but was quickly down-regulated in old macaques. Specifically, IFNB1 and differentially expressed between the young (n = 6) and old (n = 6) ChRM. Clustering was performed on the average of log2 ratios of mRNA expression relative to levels before infection by the RT-PCR-based \u0394\u0394Ct method. The genes were clustered on the basis of their expression value across samples using Euclidean distance and k-mean clustering. The progressive increases in mean log2-fold-change are represented by blue to red colors. (b) Graphs that display the characteristics of the three distinct clusters revealed in the left heat map. The threshold represents the credible induction by SIV infection for more than a 2-fold up-regulation of gene expression. The data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SEM. *P < 0.05 between the young (red circle) and old (blue square) groups, as determined by uncorrected Fisher's LSD test post two-way ANOVA. expression was highly induced in young ChRM and may have partially prevented the depletion of CD4 + T cells. As a corollary to the above, and in line with the negative correlation between ISG expression and na\u00efve lymphocyte number, it is possible that the IFN response plays a key role in the initiation of the anti-viral program and the homeostatic proliferation that compensates for the massive depletion of na\u00efve lymphocytes. However, the uncontrolled and highly activated IFN response may finally induce anergy in the IFN signal and silence the antiviral activity in the hosts.",

Because they are associated with the up-regulation of MYD88, IRF7, IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2, these genes can activate signaling cascades and lead to the activation of the NF-\u03baB and IFN-I responses [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . However, the highly significant defect in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and in the pDC-induced functional activity of CD8 + T cells observed in the elderly may result from decreased TLR surface expression and dysfunctional IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) [49] [50] [51] . Thus, integrating the contradictory findings, we suspect that immunosenescence contributes to the sensitivity to SIVmac239 and causes a high level of viral replication, which in turn elevates the host response and immune activation and ultimately accelerates disease progression in old ChRM. However, to make the best use of PBMC resources, we selected only the 6 old macaques with higher PBMC numbers and compared their gene expression levels with those in the 6 young animals. Therefore, our study may only partially reflect the relationships between gene expression and other parameters. Moreover, the T cell-specific chemokine RANTES, which plays an important role in sustaining CD8 T cell responses 52 , is markedly induced in old ChRM and associates with the homeostatic proliferation of T cells. Thus, it may be an effective marker for disease progression in old patients infected with HIV.",

Simultaneously, this process induces the robust proliferation of na\u00efve T cells and the host response to compensate for the severe exhaustion of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells (Fig. 7b) . However, the persistent immune activation and lack of immune regulation in old ChRM eventually leads to increased immunosenescence and accelerated disease progression that first prompts these events. In conclusion, aging results in increased disease severity after SIV infection, even before the chronic phase. In addition, old ChRM may serve as an excellent Model of immunosenescence, disease progression and host response in ChRM that demonstrates their variation differences during early SIV infection as detailed in the text. Immunosenescence is shown by the numbers of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and the percentage of Ki67 + na\u00efve T cells. The plasma viral loads and CD4 + T cell numbers represent the level of disease progression. The innate host response is defined by the fold-changes of differentially expressed genes. The smooth curves were constructed by a spline fit method using GraphPad Prism 6 software. model for elderly HIV-infected people and may thus promote research relating to the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and aimed at identifying therapeutic strategies for elderly patients.",

The groups include genes expressed higher in the young group (IFNB1, CCL2 and SOCS1), genes elevated in only the old group (TLR7, IFI16 and CCL5), other genes significantly correlated with immunophenotype (OAS3, CXCL10, MX2, IRF7, STAT1, IRF9, AIM2, LY96, TLR8 and IFNG) and an immunophenotype that differed between the young and old groups (CD4T, CD4 + T cell number; Ratio, CD4/CD8; CD4TN, na\u00efve CD4 + T cell number; CD8 TN, na\u00efve CD8 + T cell number; CD4Ki67, % of Ki67 + CD4 + T cells; CD4TNKi67, % of Ki67 + CD4 + T cells; CD8TNKi67, % of Ki67 + CD8 + T cells; BN, na\u00efve B cell number; BNKi67, % of Ki67 + na\u00efve B cells). The node size indicates the relative strength value according to a centrality analysis. The thicker lines indicate more correlated genes. The green lines represent significantly positive Pearson correlation coefficients \u2265 0.40, and the red lines represent significantly negative Pearson correlation coefficients \u2264 \u22120.40.
