DC-SIGN acts both as a pathogen-binding endocytic receptor and as a cell adhesion molecule, while DC-SIGNR has only the pathogen-binding function. In addition to differences in the sugar-binding properties of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in the two receptors, there are sequence differences in the adjacent neck domains, which are coiled-coil tetramerization domains comprised largely of 23-amino acid repeat units. A series of model polypeptides consisting of uniform repeat units have been characterized by gel filtration, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. The results demonstrate that two features characterize repeat units which form more stable tetramers: a leucine reside in the first position of the heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues that pack on the inside of the coiled coil and an arginine residue on the surface of the coiled coil that forms a salt bridge with a glutamic acid residue in the same polypeptide chain. In DC-SIGNR from all primates, very stable repeat units predominate, so the carbohydrate-recognition domains must be held relatively closely together. In contrast, stable repeat units are found only near the membrane in DC-SIGN. The presence of residues that disrupt tetramer formation in repeat units near the carbohydrate-recognition domains of DC-SIGN would allow these domains to splay further apart. Thus, the neck domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR can contribute to the different functions of these receptors by presenting the sugar-binding sites in different contexts.",

Pathogens bound by the receptor include viruses and fungi, which bear high mannose oligosaccharides, as well as parasites that are rich in the Lewis x epitope. The dual binding specificity can be explained at least in part by accommodation of both Lewis x and high mannose oligosaccharides in the binding site of the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that forms the ligand-binding portion of the receptor. 3 In contrast, the closely related human receptor DC-SIGNR shows more restricted binding to the high mannose oligosaccharides, allowing it to interact with viral pathogens. 4 This receptor is also designated L-SIGN, reflecting its expression on sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph nodes and liver, as well as on specific cell types in the placenta.",

            "text": "DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are similar in overall organization, consisting of tetramers that facilitate binding to multivalent targets, such as viral and cell surfaces. In both proteins, clusters of C-terminal CRDs are projected from the cell surface by extended neck domains that consists largely of multiple 23amino acid repeat units (Fig. 1) . Information about the mechanisms by which the CRDs in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are held together in oligomers is of interest because differences in the geometry of binding site clustering is believed to underlie differences in the ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus, and other viruses to bind and infect cells expressing these receptors. [6] [7] [8] Recent studies with mannose-capped quantum dots have provided further evidence that the arrangement of the binding sites must be different in the two receptors. 9 While DC-SIGN exists as a single form with seven full repeat units and one partial repeat unit, polymorphisms in the gene for DC-SIGNR result in forms that differ in the number of neck repeat units 9 and this variation is also correlated with differences in susceptibility to HIV infection. 10 To facilitate analysis of the oligomer formation by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, a strategy for purification of the neck domains has been developed, based on addition of the sequence Gly-His-His at the Cterminus of the neck domain at the point where the CRD would normally be attached [ Fig. 1(B) ]. When the neck domain oligomerizes, the resulting cluster of histidine residues allows purification of the expressed polypeptides on immobilized nickel resin. Using this approach, the neck domain of each receptor has been shown to function as an oligomerization domain that can form tetramers in the absence of the flanking membrane anchor and CRD. 11 The structure of the repeat units in the neck domain of DC-SIGNR has been deduced from an unusual crystal form in which the unit cell comprises a single repeat unit in the context of a fragment containing seven repeat units. 5 Each repeat unit consists of a short N-terminal nonhelical region that includes a proline residue, followed by a coiled-coil region. A heptad pattern of leucine, isoleucine and valine residues in the helical region mediates packing of the helices in a 4-stranded coiledcoil in the neck domain tetramer.",

In these experiments, the ability of the isolated neck domain to interact with the full extracellular portion of the receptor was investigated.

The N-terminal portions of the extracellular portions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR consist of a short region not related to the 23-amino acid repeat units, followed by a half repeat unit that is significantly divergent from the other repeat units. In previous studies, truncation of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR to remove the nonrepeat region at the N-terminus plus the partial repeat unit at this end resulted in no change in the stability of the neck domain, since the observed denaturation temperature measured by differential scanning calorimetry remained at 828C. 5, 11 Similar truncation of the neck domain of DC-SIGN results in a 7-repeat fragment that remains a tetramer at room temperature and the denaturation temperature of 568C measured by calorimetry is very close to the value of 548C for the full length neck domain previously reported (data not shown). 11 Thus, for both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, the stability of the tetramers is largely a function of the 7 full repeat units at the C-terminus of the neck domain.",

One reason for the lower stability of the natural neck domain would be the presence of the potentially destabilizing C-terminal repeat unit. In addition, the uniform neck domain contains an arginine residue at each position 15, while this residue is glutamine or glutamic acid in several of the repeat units in the natural neck domain. In the crystal structure of the neck domain, the arginine residue is on the outer surface of the bundle of helices and forms a salt bridge with a conserved glutamic acid side chain at position 12 in the same polypeptide [ Fig. 1(E) ]. Such an i,i 1 3 salt bridge hydrogen bond would contribute to stability of the repeat units. 15, 16 Together, these results define a prototype sequence of a neck repeat unit with very high stability, in which leucine is present at position 6, packed on the inside of the coiled coil and arginine is present at position 15 making a salt bridge on the outside of bundle of helices.",

Similar trends in stability were also observed by differential scanning calorimetry, in which a transition occurs at lower temperatures for the shorter constructs and is entirely absent for the version with three repeat units [ Fig. 4(B) ]. These experiments are performed at high concentrations that would favor tetramer formation, which makes it possible to observe unfolding of the tetramer in all cases except for the fragment with three repeat units. This shortest version thus shows no evidence of tetramer formation in either the gel filtration or calorimetry experiments. Fig. 4(D) ], indicating that the repeat units have the same conformation as seen in the crystal structure. However, when the number of repeat units drops below 4, there is a change in the ratio of the signals at 208 and 222 nm. Values of this ratio higher than 1 are associated with small differences in the helical pitch resulting from packing in coiled-coil structures. 17 The expected changes are best characterized for parallel 2-and 3-stranded coiled-coils, but formation of the parallel 4-helical bundle would be expected to have a similar effect. The slight decrease in the intensity of the CD signal per repeat unit for the neck domain with four repeat units is consistent with the gel filtration results showing that coiledcoil tetramer is in equilibrium with a monomeric structure at the concentration used for gel filtration and CD analysis. The higher molar concentrations of the smaller fragments required to obtain good quality spectra would favor tetramer formation, so the results probably slightly under-estimate the effect of partial dissociation for the fragment with 4 repeat units. In contrast, the fragment with only three repeat units shows a more significant loss of helical structure and a reduced ratio of the signals at 208 and 222 nm, which is consistent with the conclusion that this fragment does not form stable tetramers containing coiled coils. Taken together, these results indicate that a fully stable coiled-coil structure requires the presence of at least five repeat units.",

Some of the distinct structural features conserved in the DC-SIGNR genes are the presence of the stabilizing leucine residue at position 6 of all but the first and last repeat units and the presence of the unusual phenylalanine residue at position 6 in the repeat unit adjacent to the CRD, although there is variation in the number of repeat units. In contrast, the DC-SIGN sequences show greater diversity, although the more stable repeat units, with the leucine at position 6 and arginine at position 15, are generally found nearer to the membrane, while repeat units at the C-terminal end, towards the CRD, mostly contain glutamine at position 6. The destabilizing methionine residue is present at position 6 in only one or two repeat units in the middle of the neck domain. Conservation of these patterns, in spite of variation in the number of repeat units and the specific sequences, suggests that these features are selected because they confer different functional properties in the two receptors.",

Changing the arginine residue at position 15 results in loss of the salt bridge with the conserved glutamic acid residue at position 12, which causes some destabilization, while introduction of alternative residues at position 6 is more destabilizing. The summary of the sequences of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR molecules shown in Figure 6 reveals that relatively few repeat units are stabilized by the presence of both a leucine residue at position 6 and an arginine residue at position 15, but a high proportion of the repeat units contain one or the other of these residues. Appropriate residues at either one of these two positions may be alternative ways of achieving stability of the coiled coil.",

The circular dichroism results confirm that the presence of glutamine is compatible with the coiled coil structure, with the decreased signal reflecting the loss of stability so that the tetramer is dissociated more of the time. It may be significant that the glutamine residue at position 6 would be the first residue of the coiled coil, following the disruption caused by the preceding proline and charged residues. The loss of hydrophobic interactions may be of greater significance in this context, leading to destabilization. In contrast, the presence of a methionine residue at position leads to more significant disruption of the structure of the neck domain, which may be explained based on steric constraints resulting from the longer, linear side chain that would not readily pack inside the coiled coil. Loss of stability and the potential disruption to the helical structure resulting from the presence of a methionine residue in the middle repeat unit probably explains why the neck domain of DC-SIGN is resistant to crystallization.",

            "text": "For DC-SIGNR, a key finding to emerge from these studies is the observation that the repeat units are mostly stabilized by leucine residues at position 6 and arginine residues at position 15. The presence of a phenylalanine residue at position 20 in the repeat unit adjacent to the CRD appears to cause a flaring apart of the CRDs, but the remainder of the neck domain is a stable tetrameric coiled coil. This arrangement of very stable repeat units in the neck domain, which is conserved in all of the DC-SIGNR proteins in the primates, may be necessary to ensure that the neck domain remains tetrameric even though the final repeat units are splayed apart by the presence of the phenylalanine residue. The studies reported here suggest that the presence of stabilizing residues at positions 6 and 15 of the repeat units allows for the formation of stable tetramers even for shorter versions of the neck domain present in some individuals, which result from common genetic polymorphisms in the human population. 21, 22 However, the results also define a minimal length for the neck domain to be fully stable, even in the presence of stabilizing residues within the repeat units. The very stable structure of the coiled coil ensures that the spacing between the CRDs in DC-SIGNR is relatively fixed, although the exact orientation of the CRDs would be potentially flexible because of the flaring apart caused by the unusual repeat unit adjacent to the CRD.",

The presence of potentially less stable repeat units in the half of the DC-SIGN neck domain further from the membrane, and the presence of repeat units containing the potentially disruptive methionine residues at position 6 in a repeat unit in the middle of the neck domain, raises the possibility that the Cterminal portion of the neck domain might dissociate some of the time, so that the extracellular domain would be able to accommodate different spacings of sugar residues, as observed in recent studies with mannose-coated particles. 9 High affinity binding of lattices of sugars by multivalent receptors requires both multivalency and appropriate spacing and orientation of sugar-binding sites, 23, 24 so this arrangement would potentially allow the cluster of CRDs in the tetramer of DC-SIGN to bind clusters of ligands at a greater range of spacings.",
