Methods An entire population-based epidemiological study was conducted. Data collection was based on the Child Death Reporting Card of the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network. Trends in mortality and leading causes of death were analysed using the \u03c7 2 test and SPSS 19.0 software. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was fitted to forecast U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 using the EViews 8.0 software. results Mortality in neonates, infants and children aged under 5 years decreased by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17% from 1992 to 2015, respectively. However, the U5MR increased by 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities comprised the top five causes of death. The greatest, most rapid reduction was that of pneumonia by 92.26%, with an annual average rate of reduction of 10.53%. The distribution of causes of death differed among children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and sepsis were among the top five causes of death in children aged 28 days to 1 year and accident was among the top five causes in children aged 1-4 years. The U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030 for the period 2016-2020, based on the predictive model. Conclusion Beijing has made considerable progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs could show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. Future considerations for child healthcare include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. Specific preventative measures should be implemented for children of various age groups.",

Other models which can predict U5MRs more accurately and capture its patterns more specifically need to be explored. \u25ba Because we only collected 2-year data (2014 and 2015) after the 'Selective Two-child Policy', the representativeness of the changing trend and solid statistical analysis were limited. The relation between the changing trend in U5MRs and policy regulation is still unclear and needs to be observed for further years. We could only give a suggestion to raise healthcare workers' awareness about this potential problem. and culture of a country or region. 1 Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) calls for the U5MR to be reduced by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. 2 China established the National Maternal and Child Mortality Surveillance system (MCMS) in 1996 and has made considerable progress in reducing the U5MR over the past few decades. 3 With respect to the nationwide U5MR, MDG4 was achieved in 2008, 7 years in advance of the target. 4 Furthermore, the U5MR in China declined to 10.7\u2030 in 2015, a reduction of 80.1% from 1990. 5 Beijing established the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network in 1992. However, no report on long-term dynamic trends in the U5MR has been produced since the establishment of this monitoring network. The distribution of the causes of death is influenced by development of the social economy and healthcare. 6 Some changes have been noted in the nationwide distribution of the causes of death; pneumonia has dropped from the leading cause to fifth place whereas congenital heart disease climbed from sixth place to third place from 1996 to 2015. 3 6 7 Beijing, the capital city of China, is currently experiencing the most rapid developments in the economy and healthcare. However, the distribution of the causes of death in under-5 children has not been investigated within the last 24 years.",

Furthermore, data from 20% of the communities and hospitals were extracted annually for quality control, inspection and investigation of missing reports. Moreover, maternal and child healthcare institutions at the municipal level checked the cards reported by the district on a quarterly basis, and extracted data collected annually from 20% of the districts to ensure data integrity and accuracy. In addition, data-related staff of local maternal and child healthcare facilities were trained by specialist groups at regular intervals.

Deaths in neonates accounted for more than 50% of all deaths among under-5 children during the 24 consecutive years under investigation (figure 1). Table 1 summarises the mortality rates in neonates (NMR), infants (IMR) and under-5 children (U5MR) in Beijing, China from 1992 to 2015.

After the first notable difference, the sequence chart showed no obvious changes in trend, as confirmed by the unit root test (t=\u22123.05, p<0.05). Therefore, the difference in order (d) was 1. From table 3, the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function charts both showed trailing and declined to 0 after lag 1. Thus, we confirmed that p=1 and q=1. The model was confirmed to be ARIMA (1,1,1). The model coefficients were not significantly zero according to the t-test (p<0.05, R 2 =0.982). The Akaike information criterion and Bayes' information criterion values of the ARIMA (1,1,1) model were 2.15 and 2.30, respectively. The results of parameter estimation were incorporated with the general formula of the model to obtain the forecasting model for the under-5 mortality rate as follows:",

Several studies have reported an increase in the mean maternal age at childbirth in Beijing since the Selective Two-child Policy was implemented in 2014. 10 16 Advanced maternal age has been a proven risk factor of many disorders in under-5 children, such as prematurity and congenital abnormalities. [17] [18] [19] In the present study, the mortality rates in neonates, infants and under-5 children increased slightly in 2015, by 5.33%, 6.87% and 6.92% compared with 2014. Furthermore, the cause-specific mortality rate of preterm/low birth weight increased by 44.42% during the period 2013-2015. However, the cause-specific mortality rate of other diseases fluctuated with regular changes in interval. Therefore, we suspect that the Selective Two-child Policy may induce only a slight upward trend in the U5MR in Beijing instead of a major boost. This finding could be attributed mainly to the high level of healthcare and medical treatment available and is less likely caused by the influence of the policy on the U5MR. Using the forecasting model established in the present study, we predicted the U5MRs from 2016 to 2020 to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030, respectively, indicating a slight upward trend over the next 5 years. Thus, our suggestion is that maternal and child healthcare in Beijing still faces challenges and greater investment and attention should be provided to health facilities involved in this field.",

First, the data are reliable because our study considers the entire population, based on the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network and Beijing Maternal and Child Healthcare System which covers all under-5 children in all districts of Beijing. Thus, the present study is not limited by a small sample size or low coverage rate. Second, our study revealed the long-term trends in mortality rates and leading causes of death in under-5 children through a 24-year analysis. Furthermore, we reported the health conditions of under-5 children following implementation of the Selective Two-child Policy in Beijing in 2014. The results of our study will provide suggestions for the government to assess the present policy and formulate further regulations related to maternal and child healthcare. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, because of the unique regional divisions in Beijing and the lack of specific data on each district, we did not analyse the differences between rural and urban areas. Second, the ARIMA (1,1,1) model forecasts future U5MRs reliably, but only for a short period. This is because the model only considered variations in mortality with time, instead of other possible impacting factors such as environment, economy and politics. Data must be continually updated to predict further mortality rates. Other models which can predict U5MRs more accurately and capture its patterns more specifically are needed. Thirdly, since we only collected 2-year data (2014 and 2015) after the Selective Two Child Policy (2014), the representativeness of the changing trend and solid statistical analysis is limited. The relation between the changing trend in U5MRs and policy regulation is still unclear and is needed to be observed for further years. We could only give a suggestion to raise healthcare workers' awareness about this potential problem.",
