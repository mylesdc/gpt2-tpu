A new genotype of feline morbillivirus, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2), was isolated from urine of cats with urinary tract diseases. Whole genome sequencing showed about 78% nucleotide homology to known feline morbilliviruses. The virus was isolated in permanent cell lines of feline and simian origin. To investigate the cell tropism of FeMV-GT2 feline primary epithelial cells from the kidney, the urinary bladder and the lung, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as organotypic brain slice cultures were used for infection experiments. We demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect renal and pulmonary epithelial cells, primary cells from the cerebrum and cerebellum, as well as immune cells in the blood, especially CD4 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and monocytes. The cats used for virus isolation shed FeMV-GT2 continuously for several months despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood. Our results point towards the necessity of increased awareness for this virus when clinical signs of the aforementioned organs are encountered in cats which cannot be explained by other etiologies.",

Taking genome sequences and protein data into account many currently described paramyxoviruses are assigned as unclassified, e.g. rodent-borne Tailam Virus [2] , Nariva Virus [3] and Bank Vole Virus [4] , as well as paramyxoviruses detected in bats [5] .",

These discrepancies may be due to the complexity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis in general, making it difficult to link cases of feline CKD to only one specific trigger [17] . In some cats, feline morbilliviruses may induce a persistent infection of the urinary tract [8] . So far it is not clear whether an acute or chronic infection can cause or support the development of CKD. During our current studies an unknown feline paramyxovirus was detected in urine samples from domestic cats [13] . Although this virus was initially linked to FeMV strains from Japan, whole genome sequencing revealed a different genotype of FeMV, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2).",

After the indicated incubation period cells were centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min and the cell pellet washed twice with PBS. For discrimination of dead cells in the consecutive flow cytometric analysis, FeMV-GT2-and mock-infected PBMC were stained with fixable viability dye eFluor780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 10% (v/v) goat normal serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 15 min on ice to avoid non-specific Fc binding. Staining of surface markers was performed using FITC-anti-cat CD4 (clone vpg34, BIO-RAD, Herkules, CA, USA), Alexa Fluor \u00ae 647-anti-human CD20 (clone 2H7, BIO-RAD, Herkules, CA, USA) and PE-anti-human CD8 (clone 3B5, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The corresponding isotype controls were all purchased from eBioscience. Surface staining was performed by incubation of cells with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in FACS-buffer (PBS with 3% FBS) for 15 min on ice. Stained cells were fixed for 20 min at 4 \u2022 C with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. For intracellular detection of FeMV-GT2, cells were permeabilized using 0.5% saponin in FACS-buffer for 20 min at room temperature (RT). The virus was labeled by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-FeMV-nucleoprotein antibody (generated in-house) at 1 \u00b5g/mL (in FACS-Saponin-buffer for 20 min at room temperature followed by two washing steps in FACS-saponin buffer. Finally, cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of Pacific Blue\u2122-anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in FACS-saponin buffer for 20 min at RT followed by two consecutive washing steps with FACS buffer. The cells were acquired with a BD LSR Fortessa TM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and viable cells were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.6.5 software (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). The gating strategy is shown in supplementary files, Figure S1 .",

Brains from animals euthanized for medical reasons unrelated to this study, were dissected and the cerebrum was separated from the cerebellum. Following preparation the tissue was immediately submerged in ice-cold HBSS and slices were generated using a VT1000s (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) microtome. Due to the difference in tissue rigidity, slices of the cerebrum were cut to 200 \u00b5m and of the cerebellum were cut to 300 \u00b5m thickness. Freshly prepared brain slices were transferred to cell culture inserts (0.4 \u00b5m, Merck Millipore) pre-equilibrated with HBSS and placed into 6-well cell culture plates (Greiner bio-one, Austria). For cultivation, minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 25% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM HBSS and 10 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin was used and changed daily. Cultures were incubated at 37 \u2022 C, 90% humidity and 5% CO 2 . After 17 days of cultivation each slice was infected by direct application of 1800 FFU of FeMV-GT2-Gordon strain to the tissue. Negative controls (mock infections) were generated by applying an equivalent volume of DMEM with 2% FBS to the brain tissue. 10 days after infection slices were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 60 min. Slices were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (TPBS) for 30 min and blocked in TPBS with 20% horse serum and 2% BSA for 60 min. The primary antibody raised against the FeMV-nucleoprotein was diluted (1:100) in blocking buffer and incubated with the samples for 72 h at 4 \u2022 C with constant agitation. After washing with PBS a goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed, Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 labeled secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was diluted (1:1000) in blocking buffer, applied to the slices and incubated for two hours. Nuclei were counter-stained using DAPI (300 nM). After two subsequent washing steps with PBS the slices were visualized using a Leica SP 8 confocal microscope.",

Six samples (0.83%) were positive for a previously unknown paramyxovirus, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2). Based on physical examination and urinalysis findings all six animals were diagnosed with diseases of the urinary tract (i.e. acute or chronic kidney disease; Table 1 ). No viral RNA was detectable within the available serum and EDTA-blood samples from these urine-positive animals. Two cats ('Gordon' and 'TV25') were sampled for several months and were found to be positive for FeMV-GT2-RNA by PCR within the urine at all time points tested (Table 1) . Electron microscopy analysis and successful virus isolation from fresh urine samples of these two animals revealed that intact viral particles were released. Interestingly, corresponding serum samples from 'Gordon' and 'TV25' showed high titers of FeMV-GT2-specific neutralizing antibodies (titer > 256).

Primers were designed from conserved regions of available FeMV sequences. FeMV-GT2 fragments were amplified and gaps were filled by applying the primer walking strategy. Near-complete genome sequences of two FeMV-GT2 strains ('Gordon' and 'TV25', accession numbers MK182089 and MK182090) from domestic cats were revealed. Nucleotide sequences from strains were 99.2% identical, differing in only 130 nucleotides mainly located in the non-coding regions of the genome. The genome organization of FeMV-GT2 resembled that of classical FeMV strains, encoding six (3 -N-P/V/C-M-F-H-L-5 ) open reading frames (ORFs), typical for other morbilliviruses. Pairwise alignments of the ORFs between FeMV and FeMV-GT2 demonstrated nucleotide identities ranging between 80.5% (phosphoprotein) and 83.3% (matrix protein) and an overall whole genome nucleotide identity of about 78.2% (Table 3) . Amino acid conservation between FeMV and FeMV-GT2 was found to be higher than 85% for all structural proteins, except for the phosphoprotein where the amino acid identity of the FeMV-GT-Gordon strain to FeMV was only 75% (Table 3) . Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences demonstrated that FeMV-GT2 is genetically closely related to (Figure 3) , but yet distinct from, previously described feline morbilliviruses [6] . Therefore, we suggest that FeMV-GT2 should be considered as a different genotype of feline morbilliviruses. ",

Isolated cells represented a mixture (approximately 50%:50%) of cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells and vimentin-positive non-epithelial cells. An in-depth analysis further showed that cells also expressed the renal collecting duct cell marker aquaporin-2 [27] , the distal tubulus cell marker calbindin D28K [28] and the proximal tubulus cell marker alkaline phosphatase [29] . Hence, it was concluded that the isolated primary feline kidney cells express the terminal differentiation markers also present in na\u00efve tissues and are therefore suitable for in vitro infection experiments. The cells were infected at an MOI of 0.5 for two hours and thereafter cultured for five days prior to FeMV-GT2 nucleoprotein staining. Mock-infected cells served as negative controls.",

No cytopathic effects (e.g. formation of syncytia) or significant cell death in comparison to the mock-infection was detected. These observations were reproduced from cell preparations of three individual animals. The nature of the FeMV-GT2-susceptible cell types was elucidated by cytokeratin staining (marker for cells of epithelial origin). Renal epithelial cells were shown to be the main target of FeMV-GT2 (Figure 4) , although a minority (~10%) of non-epithelial cells were also susceptible to this virus. To elucidate the involvement of adjacent organs in virus shedding, primary feline bladder epithelial cells were isolated and infected with FeMV-GT2 as described above. As shown in Figure 5 , primary feline bladder cells were successfully isolated from clinical material and stained positive for cytokeratins as expected for cell types of epithelial origin.

Intracellular virus in different immune cell populations was quantified 48 h after infection by flow cytometry (Figure 6 ). The results of these investigations demonstrated that CD4 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and FSC hi monocytes are susceptible to FeMV-GT2 infections in vitro. The percentage of virus-positive cells varied from 40-70% for CD4 + T cells and from 20-40% for both CD20 + B cells and FSC hi monocytes ( Figure 6A ).

            "text": "The family of Paramyxoviridae is currently divided into seven distinct genera. The number of unassigned paramyxoviruses is still increasing because well-established classification schemes, like sequence comparisons based on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) or pairwise analysis of sequence complementarity (PASC) of all ORFs is often connected to several difficulties among new paramyxoviruses [30] . Feline morbilliviruses (FeMV) were found to be clearly distinguishable from the classical morbilliviruses, such as CDV or MeV based on phylogenetic analyses [14, 15] despite the fact that the size and organization of their genome reflects properties as defined for the genus morbilliviruses. Here, we describe a second morbillivirus isolated from domestic cats, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2). This virus grouped together with previously described feline morbilliviruses (FeMV), but could be separated from these isolates based on whole genome sequences (Figure 3 ). Amino acid identities between the FeMV-GT2 and the FeMV structural proteins ranged between 75-92%. These differences are comparable to the species cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) where currently five strains from different animal species exhibit a similar genetic diversity as identified for FeMV and FeMV-GT2 in our study [31] . In addition, electron microscopy revealed a similar morphology of the FeMV-GT2 particle as described for FeMV [14] and other morbilliviruses. We observed a wider ribonucleocapsid protein (RNP) in FeMV-GT2 preparations, but this could be due to a preparation or staining artefact, but may also be an intrinsic feature of feline morbilliviruses. Therefore, we provisional propose that FeMV-GT2 should be considered as a different genotype of FeMV. To clarify the taxonomic status of FeMV-GT2 more information about the genetic diversity of circulating strains is needed and should be addressed to future studies.",

Urine samples were collected as part of the routine clinical work and for practical reasons they were stored for some weeks at -20 \u2022 C before RNA extraction could be performed. Thus, RNA degradation may have occurred influencing the sensitivity of the PCR analysis. Two cats were FeMV-GT2-positive for several months till years, with virus shedding in their urine emphasizing that the virus is able to establish persistent infections. This is in accordance with published data about prolonged FeMV-infections in domestic cats [8, 13, 32] . Interestingly, virus secretion within the urine in two persistently infected cats ('Gordon' and 'TV25', Table 1 ) continued despite high titers of FeMV-GT2-specific neutralizing antibodies in the blood. This is in contrast to other morbillivirus infections were neutralizing antibody titers higher than 32 or 120 prevent virus secretion in CDV [33] and MeV [34] , respectively. The reason for this phenomenon remains speculative at the moment, but can be the result of FeMV-GT2 replication in epithelial cells of the kidney, FeMV-GT2 escape mutants or impaired T-cell response in infected animals.",

In addition, it is known that CKD is common in geriatric cats with prevalence ranging between 28-50% [35, 36] leading to the possibility of a statistical connection between FeMV-GT2 and CKD.

Whether this virus location is also reflected in natural infections needs to be clarified by (immune)-histopathology in diseased or experimentally infected cats. Feline urinary bladder epithelial cells were significantly less susceptible to FeMV-GT2. The reproducibility of the results excludes the possibility that this observation was caused by the cat's individual medical histories. Data generated from in vitro infection experiments might, however, differ from the in vivo situation. The cultivation medium used for primary kidney cells, for instance, might influence the expression of terminal differentiation markers and serial passaging of these cells can induce dedifferentiation of primary distal renal tubular cells [38] . Equally, primary bladder epithelial cells might not display their physiological surface markers, so-called uroplakins, when cultured in vitro [39] . Therefore, it is possible that the FeMV-GT2 tissue tropism observed in our in vitro experiments differs from the in vivo conditions. On the other hand, FeMV was shown to replicate in renal tubular cells in naturally infected cats [6, 15, 40] , supporting our results for a kidney-associated FeMV-GT2 replication.",

Whether alveolar macrophages may also contribute to virus replication in the lung could not be investigated in this study, due to the lack of specific antibodies for phenotyping feline alveolar macrophages. Alongside infections of the lung, CDV and MeV are able to infect and induce severe damage to the brain under certain circumstances [37] . Although the mechanism of how CDV and MeV enter the brain is not completely understood, a leukocyte-associated virus transport as a source of hematogenous brain infections is hypothesized [37] . Our in vitro findings show that such a mechanism might also be responsible for the spread of FeMV-GT2 in the body of affected animals as brain slice cultures were susceptible to the FeMV-GT2-Gordon strain. Although the specific nature of the affected cell types could not be determined definitely, it is likely that neurons are a target as GFAP-positive cells (representing glia cells) were found to be FeMV-GT2-negative in our in vitro experiments. These data revealed that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect feline brain cells integrated into a physiological tissue environment. However, this needs further investigation in controlled animal infection experiments.",

            "text": "Although the observed in vitro tropism of FeMV-GT2 is in line with naturally FeMV-infections [6, 15, 40] and resembles the pathology of other morbilliviruses as CDV or MeV [37] it cannot be completely excluded that these are in part the result of viral mutations emerged through the cell culture adaption process. It is well known that Vero-adapted MeV strains acquired mutations leading to the usage of CD46 as a viral entry receptor which is not a characteristic of MeV wild type strains [43] . The possibility that FeMV-GT2 have gained mutations might explain our observation that viral titer increased about 100-fold on LLC-MK2 cells between consecutive passages. On the other hand, titers remained low in CrFK, Vero and BHK-21 cells independent from the number of blind passages. Therefore, raising titers in the first passages of LLC-MK2 cells can also be addressed to a low concentration of augmentable virus in urine samples. In depth sequencing approaches of FeMV-GT2-positive urine samples and the respective cell culture adapted viral isolates will help to interpret our in vitro findings in the context of viral pathogenesis and should be conducted in future studies.",

Although the aforementioned organs are well known as infections sites for CDV and MeV [37] , they have not been characterized as target tissues for FeMV in the past. Until recently, the feline kidney was focused on being the target of feline morbilliviruses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Our data clearly demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 can infect primary cells obtained from other organs and that the pathologic potential of FeMV and FeMV-GT2 might currently be underestimated.
