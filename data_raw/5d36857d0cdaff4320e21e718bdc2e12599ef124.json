            "text": "Background: Since 2010, outbreaks of genotype 2 (G2) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused high mortality in neonatal piglets and have had devastating impacts on the swine industry in many countries. A reliable serological assay for evaluating the PEDV-specific humoral and mucosal immune response is important for disease survey, monitoring the efficacy of immunization, and designing strategies for the prevention and control of PED. Two PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed using G2b PEDV-Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) trimeric full-length S and truncated S 1-501 proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression system. The truncated S 1-501 protein was selected from a superior expressed stable cell line. The sensitivity and specificity of these two ELISAs were compared to immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells and to a commercial nucleocapsid (N)-based indirect ELISA kit using a panel of PEDV negative and hyperimmune sera.",

Interestingly, the S 1-501 -based ELISA had even higher sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 99.1%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.97) with the immunostaining result. A fair agreement (kappa< 0.4) was seen between the commercial N-based ELISA and either of our S-based ELISAs. However, the results of the full-length S-based ELISA shared an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92) with that of S 1-501 -based ELISA.",

Commercially available ELISA kits for PEDV are mainly based on the N protein of PEDV, because N protein is the dominant protein. It is massively produced during the infection procedure and is able to provoke strong immune responses [24] . However, previous studies have revealed that whole virus, N protein, or M protein-based ELISA may detect cross-reactive antibodies against other swine coronaviruses [25] . On the other hand, several PEDV S-based ELISAs have been developed [26] [27] [28] and confirmed no cross-reactivity with other porcine coronaviruses [26, 28] . These results suggest that S-based ELISA may be more suitable for detecting PEDV-specific antibodies.",

The anti-PEDV titers of these serum samples were characterized by either immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or immunocytochemical staining (ICC). The representative immunostained images were shown in Fig. 1 . While all samples exhibited high staining backgrounds at the dilutions < 1:160 in the immunostainings, the titer of the serum samples above 1:160 dilution was determined by two-fold serial dilution in our study. The immunostaining titers of all the negative samples, including C-N pigs and SPF-N pigs, were < 1:160, thus confirming them as negative serum samples. The immunostaining titers of the positive group C-I pigs ranged from 1:320-1:5120, including 7 serum samples of 1:320; 8 serum sample of 1:640, 9 serum samples of 1:1280, 15 serum samples of 1:2560, and 11 serum samples of 1:5120. The immunostaining titers of all fifteen SPF-I pigs were consistently 1:5120. The serum titers of the pigs varied from 1:1280-\u22651:20480, including 1 serum sample of 1:1280, 5 serum samples of 1:2560, 4 serum samples of 1:5120, 11 serum samples of 1:10240, and 5 serum samples of \u22651:20480. All serum samples from the positive group were confirmed positive by the immunostaining. All colostrum (5/5) of the SPF sows had the titer < 1:160, representing no detectable PEDV-specific IgA. However, all colostrum samples of the conventional sows were positive, including 9 colostrum of 1:160, 6 colostrum of 1:320, 3 colostrum of 1:640, 2 colostrum of 1: 1280, and 3 colostrum of 1:2560.",

As shown Fig. 1 Representative images of immunostaining of serum samples against G2b PEDV-PT infected Vero cells. Vero cells were seeded onto 96-well plates and grown overnight until reaching 90% confluency. The Vero cells were challenged with 1000 TCID 50 /mL of G2b PEDV-PT-P6 diluted in post-inoculation (PI) medium. Vero cells with syncytial cells, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of PEDV, were fixed with acetone after 24 h of incubation. Each serum sample from different sources was serially diluted from 160-fold to 20,480-fold, then added to the plates and incubated for 1 h.

            "text": "Two PEDV S protein-based ELISAs, the full-length Sbased and the truncated S 1-501 -based ELISAs, were developed in this study. The standard that was used for comparison in this study is immunostaining against G2b PEDV-PT infected Vero cells. Based on this, our results show that the performance of the S 1-501 -based ELISA in detection of PEDV specific IgG is better than that of the full-length S-based ELISA and the commercialized PEDV N-based ELISA. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that both PEDV S protein-based ELISAs are able to detect the IgA antibodies in colostrum and both G1b and G2 PEDV specific serum IgG. Because of its excellent performance and high protein yield, the S 1-501based ELISA is the most affordable and efficient choice for developing serological assays for PEDV. Several ELISAs for detecting PEDV-specific antibodies have been established in previous studies in which the majority of the coating antigens, including S1, N, or M protein [23, 24, 28, 33] , were expressed by a prokaryotic protein expression system to achieve a high yield of protein production. However, protein expressed using a prokaryotic expression system may lack the appropriate protein folding and the complexity of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which could lead to a reduction in the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA kits. In this study, a HEK-293 mammalian expression system was used to express the coating antigens, S proteins, for the development of PEDV ELISAs. The S protein of PEDV is a key target for virus neutralization and vaccine development [1, 4] and contains several neutralizing epitopes [8, 13, [15] [16] [17] , which may be an important indicator for evaluating immunity against PEDV [1] . The S protein of coronavirus has been demonstrated to display a complex structure and contains at least 21-35 predicted N-glycosylation sites. The mammalian protein expression system allows for proper formation of complex multidimensional structures and post-translational modifications, thereby generating antigens that can attain a high sensitivity in ELISAs [12, 34, 35] . The S protein of PEDV is a trimeric protein [36] and, similar to other coronaviruses, the trimeric form of the S protein may contain more conformational epitopes than a monomeric protein [37] . Therefore, the full length of the trimeric spike protein containing all S1 and S2 epitopes is considered an important target for the development of ELISAs [8, [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the large molecular size of the full-length S protein presents a challenge for large scale protein expression and production [32] . With these difficulties, many studies have preferred to use S1 instead of full-length S to conduct both vaccine and serological assay development [28, 31, 38] . The high sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA developed using the S1 protein of PEDV produced by Freestyle 293-F cells [26] suggests that truncated S proteins might also be good candidates for developing PEDV S-based ELISA. However, the performance of the S1-based ELISA has never been compared with the full-length PEDV S-based ELISA. Based on the comparison of the protein yields of different truncated S protein-expressing stable HEK-293 cells, the S 1-501 -based ELISA was successfully developed. Interestingly, the full-length S-based ELISA was not superior in terms of its ability to detect PEDV-specific antibodies compared with the truncated S 1-501 -based ELISAs. In the present study, the S 1-501 protein was prepared from the supernatant of a stable cell line to reduce the expenses for transfection and expression. Furthermore, the S 1-501 expressing stable cell line was selected based on its superior protein expression quantity (40 \u03bcg/ mL culture supernatant) to others. For ELISA application, approximately 20 \u03bcg of S protein was used for preparing a 96-well plate ELISA. These suggest that each mL of culture supernatant could be used to prepare two ELISA plates. The excellent performance of the truncated S 1-501 -based ELISA with the highest protein expression level indicates this would be a good antigen and for PEDV ELISA. Our findings are similar to those of previous reports in which S protein was found to be an ideal antigen for developing ELISA, with a higher sensitivity and better specificity than N protein-based ELISAs [27, 39] . Both full-length S-based and S 1-501 -based ELI-SAs have much better sensitivities than the commercial N-based ELISA kit. The S-based ELISAs used in this study can be used in both SPF pigs, conventional pigs, and sows, whereas commercial N-based ELISAs only perform well in SPF pigs, which have a relatively low background and stronger immune response. The Sbased ELISAs can be used to detect the immune response and the immune status of the population and is an indispensable tool in evaluating the efficacy of PEDV vaccines [39] .",

Therefore, establishing a serological assay that is able to detect anti-G1 and G2b PEDV antibodies is important in order to evaluate the immune status of swine populations. Since there is no clinically confirmed serum against G1b PEDV available in our lab, the full-length of the G1b PEDV S protein derived from a historic Taiwan strain was generated and used as an antigen to immunize pigs for the generation of hyperimmune serum against S protein from G1b PEDV strains. The S protein, in particular S1, has been demonstrated to have a relatively high heterogeneity between genotypes and clusters (the identity of amino acid ranges from 91 to 99.6%) compared with other proteins [43] . The amino acid sequence of fulllength S and S 1-501 of the G2b PEDV-PT strain share approximately 94% and 86-88% identity with G1b PEDV S proteins, respectively. We demonstrated that the S 1-501 ELISAs derived from the G2b PEDV-PT strain, showed a comparable performance with the full-length S-based ELISA in detecting homologous G2b and heterologous G1b PEDV-specific antibodies.",

The samples were added to the plates of PEDV-infected Vero cells prepared previously, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking, and washed six times with PBS (Gibco). Next, 200 \u03bcL of the goat-anti-swine IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (KPL, SeraCare, MA, USA) or conjugated with fluorescence (Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA) was diluted 200-fold and added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. After washing six times with PBS (Gibco), the staining was visualized using the EnVision-DAB+ system (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or by observing the fluorescence under a microscope. To standardize the coloration procedure, each plate included the same positive serum diluted 5120-fold as the positive control and the color development was stopped once the positive control colorized. The color development was evaluated using an inverted light/fluorescence microscope. To avoid any possible non-specific signals of the immunostaining, a signal was only considered positive when appearing on syncytial Vero cells, which show the CPE. If the signals appeared on the morphologically normal Vero cells but not on the CPE cells, the result was considered negative.",

After washing three times, 100 \u03bcL of substrate (IDVet) was added to the wells and allowed to react for coloration for 15 min before the stop solution (IDVet) was used to stop the coloration reaction. The plates were read at 405 nm using the EMax Plus Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK).
