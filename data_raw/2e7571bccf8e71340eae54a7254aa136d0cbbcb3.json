RSV testing data from Primary Children's Medical Center were collected on children under two years of age (July 2001-June 2008). Simple linear regression was used explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. A compartmental model of transmission was fit to the data and parameter estimated used to help describe the variation among seasonal RSV epidemic curves.

RSV is associated with substantial morbidity in children in both the hospitalized and outpatient setting [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition to the toll on the health of the population, this disease imposes a large burden on the health care system in terms of human and material resources. Although no RSV vaccine exists, infants and children with risk factors for severe RSV infection (eg, lung disease or prematurity) can receive monthly doses of palivizumab, a humanized murine anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, during the RSV season. Palivizumab treatment is extremely costly; the cost-effectiveness of this therapy could be improved if treatment is given only during times of high RSV activity. Treatment of vulnerable individuals also improves overall health in the population.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers using the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System found that the prior epidemic season's data were a relatively imprecise predictor of the epidemic season onset in a given community and that timing of the RSV epidemic season may vary substantially in the same year among communities in close proximity [7] . One goal of this research was to explore year-to-year variation in epidemic seasons using local data. The biennial variation in our seasonal epidemic data was seen in the early exponential growth rates (slope of the cumulative case curves, Figure 1 ) as well as total epidemic size. We explored the relationship between exponential growth of RSV epidemics and the seasonal epidemic characteristics of total epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length to assess predictions made early in the epidemic season.",

These methods are being increasingly applied to emerging threats like SARS [10] [11] [12] and pandemic influenza, but their application to routine epidemics of common respiratory viruses like seasonal influenza and RSV has only begun to be explored. Weber et al. [8] model RSV transmission to examine how climate and social factors influence transmission in a population. They consider compartmental models using Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) with additions to include latency and stages of susceptibility. They find no single best model for RSV epidemics; many \"competing\" models fit the observed data well. We further explored the variation in seasonal epidemics using compartmental models. The variation in exponential growth could potentially be related to variation in transmission rates, epidemic start dates, or proportions susceptible as well as a host of other factors.",

There is an offset to this cycle (\u03b1), which we estimate along with transmission parameter (\u03b2). Births and deaths (\u03bc) are accounted for in the susceptible class only.

The biennial cycle of large, early, and short seasonal epidemics followed by smaller, later, and longer seasonal epidemics the next year observed in Utah is similar to other published studies of seasonal RSV epidemics in temperate climates. The theories for this phenomenon include the existence and switching of two RSV disease strains, climate patterns, and waning immunity after infection [6, 8, 9, [22] [23] [24] . These and other theories could be investigated in more complex models. It is understood that immunity after infection of RSV is partial, at best. This incomplete immunity and severity of re-infections could be incorporated into more complex models [8, 25] . Finally, future modeling efforts will involve approaches that include measures of uncertainty in parameter estimates, including Bayesian methods [26, 27] and likelihood and other methods [28, 29] .",

The variations in epidemic seasons from data collected at PCMC during the seven years of the study can be partially explained by the variation in exponential growth, especially characteristics of epidemic size, peak day, and length of the epidemic. The seven years of data were not sufficient to make conclusive statements on the nature of the relationships. These early findings based on just seven data points can be built upon to explore early prediction of Table 2 Results of regression analysis using exponential growth to predict epidemic size, days to peak, and length the upcoming RSV epidemic season. These early predictions could be used by hospitals to budget and allocate resources and to coordinate the timing of palivizumab treatment. They can be used by public health to advise clinicians and the public and also to help identify nonstandard epidemics earlier in the season. For example, health departments might take specific actions if the number of observed cases during the season greatly exceeds early predictions.",

The three model parameters allowed to vary by epidemic year (detection fraction, transmission parameter, and offset) provided possible rationale for the variation in seasonal epidemic size. The model with detection fraction held constant across epidemic year fits the observed data well with the fewest parameters. The parameter estimates from this model also match the expected biennial pattern of the epidemic years. From the models considered in this study, this one performs best overall (Figure 4 ).",
