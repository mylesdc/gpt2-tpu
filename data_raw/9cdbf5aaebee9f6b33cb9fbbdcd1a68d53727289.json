            "text": "Background: The functional state of glial cells, like astrocytes and microglia, critically modulates the course of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and can have both detrimental and beneficial effects. Glial cell function is tightly controlled by cellular interactions in which cytokines are important messengers. Recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. During the course of CNS diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease, and in the corresponding animal models, the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation, arguing for an important role of these chemokines and their corresponding receptor CXCR3 in glial activation. To clarify the role of this chemokine system in glial cell activation, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 on glial activation in a model of toxic demyelination in which glial activation without a prominent influx of hematogenous cells is prototypical. Methods: We investigated the impact of CXCR3 on cuprizone-induced demyelination, comparing CXCR3-deficient mice with wild type controls. The clinical course during cuprizone feeding was documented for five weeks and for the subsequent four days withdrawal of the cuprizone diet (5.5 weeks). Glial activation was characterized using histological, histomorphometric and phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis for (de)myelination and neuroinflammation was applied to characterize the effect of cuprizone on CXCR3-deficient mice and control animals. Results: CXCR3-deficient mice displayed a milder clinical course during cuprizone feeding and a more rapid body weight recovery after offset of diet. In the CNS, CXCR3 deficiency significantly attenuated the accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a deficiency of CXCR3 reduced the expression of the microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. Compared to controls, we observed a vast reduction of RNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines like Ccl2, Cxcl10, Tnf and Il6 within the CNS of cuprizone-treated mice. Lastly, CXCR3 deficiency had no major effects on the course of demyelination during cuprizone feeding. Conclusions: The CXCR3 chemokine system is critically involved in the intrinsic glial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination, which significantly modulates the distribution of glial cells and the local cytokine milieu.",

Both microglia and astrocytes can be rapidly activated through mechanisms like pattern recognition receptors detecting infectious and endogenous danger signals [7, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In response, activated microglia and astrocytes produce inflammatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines, which critically modulate the course of CNS diseases.

Cuprizone was mixed into a powdered ground standard rodent chow. Before cuprizone administration, all mice of the study were adapted to powdered normal chow for one week. Cuprizone diet was then maintained for five weeks following four additional days on normal chow, representing the stage of CNS-remyelination. As a marker for the clinical outcome of cuprizone administration, the body weight of all mice was monitored twice a week. A total of 4 to 5 WT and CXCR3-/-mice were analyzed at each of the four time points of the experiment (0, 3, 5, and 5 weeks + 4 additional days normal chow/ 5.5 weeks). Animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains were removed immediately and cut along the sagittal midline.

We characterized microglial activation by lectin histochemistry and found differences in microglial activation for all examined brain regions. The differences in areas like the cerebellum or the thalamus were striking and highly significant. Notably, the effect of CXCR3 on microglial accumulation and glial activation was less prominent in the corpus callosum, although cuprizone-induced myelination is most distinct in this area. These regional differences of the effect of CXCR3-deficiency might be explained with the different state of demyelination in these areas. Very extensive demyelination as observed in the corpus callosum could lead to a maximal microglial activation, which cannot be attenuated by the loss of one modulating factor like CXCR3. Still, these findings demonstrate the potent effect of CXCR3 on glial activation in the examined model. The differences in microglial activation were further substantiated by co-localization of the microglial activation marker CD68, which was much lower expressed in microglia from CXCR3-deficient mice, and by flow cytometry. Here, we Figure 6 Substantially reduced transcripts for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in CXCR3-/-brains.

            "text": "The modulating effects of CXCR3 were not restricted to microglial cells. GFAP staining and analysis of GFAP + cells revealed that GFAP + astrocytes were less frequent and less activated by morphological criteria in CXCR3deficient mice. However, we cannot discriminate if this observation is directly induced by CXCR3 deficiency or the consequence of reduced microglial activation. Skripuletz et al. demonstrated in a recent study that a lack of astrocytes during cuprizone feeding results in less demyelination and less microglial activation and found evidence that this effect is mediated by a lack of astrocytic CXCL10 [63] . In regard to our study, we cannot exclude that the changes in microglial activation we observe are at least partly caused by a reduced synthesis of CXCL10 by CXCR3-deficient astrocytes. However, a study examining the effect of chronic expression of cerebral CXCL10 could not detect an impact of CXCL10 on microglial activation [64] . As astrocytes and microglia intimately interact and both carry the CXCR3 receptor, it is likely that the lack of CXCR3 on microglia and astrocytes has a synergistic effect on the activation of the cell types [65] .",

Corresponding to the activation time-course revealed by flow cytometry, we found a striking attenuation of all inflammatory molecules examined. This was most prominent for prototypical proinflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1 or the chemokine CCL2. Interestingly, the RNA levels of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 were drastically reduced and comparable to untreated controls in CXCR3-deficient mice. This might argue for an auto-or paracrine loop in which CXCR3activation increases the production of CXCR3 ligands in glial cells.",

Despite the striking changes in the glial activation and cytokine expression, we could not detect a significant change in the course of de-and remyelination. Neither histological evaluation nor the course of the molecular markers Mbp, Plp1 or Cnp revealed differences of de-and remyelination between CXCR3-competent and CXCR3deficient mice. Although there is some evidence that oligodendrocytes express a functional CXCR3 receptor [66, 67] , the lack of differences in demyelination argues strongly against a direct modulatory effect of CXCR3 on the extent of oligodendrocyte damage in this model. During remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, oligodendrocyte precursor cells become recruited, proliferate and have to undergo maturation [68, 69] .",
