All study participants will be offered to receive an additional optional booster immunization with licensed inactivated monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and will elicit an antibody response. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine at a dosage of 4 mg administered in a 3-injection schedule. The secondary objectives are to evaluate antibody responses including induced antibody titer as measured by a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and to document the reactogenicity of the inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine when administered to subjects previously vaccinated with the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine.",

It takes more than six months from identification of a pandemic influenza strain to production of the first doses of vaccine using licensed technology [21] . Delays in production could result from poor growth of the virus strain used to make the vaccine. Recombinant DNA technologies allow much faster development and production of the vaccine candidates that are based on viral genome sequences. Testing these potential vaccine candidates in Phase I clinical studies may provide urgently needed data on immunogenicity of a novel influenza strain and clarify if exposure to other influenza subtypes may offer some cross protection. The disadvantage of current DNA vaccines is that it may take several injections to generate an immune response with a magnitude and durability considered adequate for protection [22] . Therefore beyond the proof of concept aspect demonstrating ability to rapidly produce a vaccine, further development of ways to induce a desirable immune response by a single immunization may be needed in the future.",

The plasmid CMV/R promoter consists of translational enhancer region of the CMV immediate early region 1 enhancer (CMV-IE) substituted with the 5 -untranslated human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) R-U5 region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 HTLV-1 long terminal repeat VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP is manufactured at the VRC/NIAID/Vaccine Pilot Plant (VPP) using plasmid DNA received from the VRC to produce clinical trial material under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The process for manufacturing, filling, and packaging VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP is summarized in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). Briefly, the plasmid used in the Master Cell Bank (MCB) was synthesized by VRC using Blue Heron Biotechnology, Inc (Bothell, WA) for human preferred codons as previously described [40] . The plasmid was then transferred to the VPP and the sequence was confirmed before use in the cGMP production process. The plasmid was used to transform the Escherichia coli bacterial host strain, DH5 , in order to produce individual MCB. The MCB was expanded in culture and inoculated into a 100liter fermentor for production. Bacterial cell growth was dependent upon the cellular expression of the kanamycin resistance protein encoded by a portion of the plasmid DNA. Following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid, the plasmid DNA was purified from cellular components, concentrated, filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m membrane, and stored until formulation of the drug product. The final vaccine product will meet lot release specifications prior to administration.",

Exploratory endpoints are HA-specific T-cell responses (as measured by ICS assay and ELISPOT assay). For the HAI assay endpoint, a positive response for a subject is defined as the subject achieving a 4-fold rise in HA HAI antibody titer from baseline (Day 0) to 4 weeks post any of the vaccinations; for subjects with no immunity at baseline (<1:10 titer), this will be an increase to a titer of 1:40 (defined as seroprotection) and for subjects with a positive titer at baseline, a positive titer will need to be 4 fold higher than the Day 0 value (defined as seroconversion) [42, 43] . For the exploratory endpoints on HA-specific T-cell responses, responses will be considered positive if an increase of at least 50 SFC above background will be detected by ELISpot assay, or 0.05% increase over baseline in the ICS assay for CD4 or CD8 cells is detected. The subjects will be recorded as having a positive response whenever the assays at 4 weeks after any of the injections are positive and having a negative response for whenever these assays are negative. The exploratory objectives related to further evaluation of the humoral and cellular immune responses will include evaluation of these responses from baseline to the last study visit.",

Useful values are the minimum true event rate such that the probability of observing at least one event is at least 90% and the maximum true event rate such that the probability of not observing any event is at least 90%. Within n=20 vaccinees, there is over 90% chance to observe at least 1 SAE if the true rate is at least 0.109 and over 90% chance to observe no SAE if the true rate is no more than 0.005. Probabilities of observing 0 or more than 1 serious adverse event within group are presented in Table 6 .1 for a range of possible true event rates. These calculations provide a more complete picture of the sensitivity of this study design to identify potential safety problems with the vaccine. Table 6 .2 is applicable to the immunogenic response rates, and gives the exact 95% confidence interval of the true response rate over possible number of responses out of the 20 vaccinees. For example, if we observe 4 responses among the 20 vaccinees, the 95% exact binomial confidence interval of the true response rate will range from 0.057 to 0.437. Table 6 .1 gives the probabilities of observing 0 or at least 2 responses over a range of underlying response rates. For example, if the true response rate at a particular time point is 0.20, then there is a probability of 0.988 to observe at least one response and a probability of 0.931 to observe at least two responses among the 20 vaccinees.",

Proteins are natural substances that the body uses as building blocks. DNA serves as nature's code (instructions) for protein production in the body. A new kind of experimental vaccine being tested in this study is made from the DNA that is the code for novel influenza protein. It is a sterile preparation in a salt water solution. In this study, the DNA vaccine will be injected into a muscle. It will instruct the body to make a small amount of the influenza protein.

You have already received vaccinations with this experimental DNA vaccine. At the time you enrolled in the study your rights, the study purpose, procedures, risks and benefits were discussed and you consented to take part. You are now being offered the option of receiving an injection with the FDA-approved inactivated influenza vaccine licensed for use in 2009-2010 season to prevent \"swine flu.\" This licensed vaccine has been widely used for vaccination this flu season. If you agree to receive the licensed vaccine at the VRC Clinic, we want to collect blood samples for research to see if it impacts your immune responses. If you received this vaccine outside of the VRC Clinic, your signature on this consent would be to allow collection of the extra blood samples for research purposes.

Day 0=day of enrollment and first injection; Day 0 evaluations prior to first DNA injection are the baseline for assessing adverse events subsequently. Schedule subsequent DNA injections for Day 28 7 days and Day 56 7 days. Schedule the \"B\" visit telephone evaluations for 1 or 2 days after each injection. Schedule the \"C\" visits at 7days (-1, +2 days) post vaccination. In the study database, \"A\" visits are the evaluations (vital signs and injection site assessment) at 30-45 minutes after study injections. If a vaccination is not given, then the subsequent A, B and C visits are not required, but continue with the other required ongoing safety and immunogenicity follow-up. Visit 06 (H1N1vaccine) is optional and shown as \"Wk 24\", but may be any time after Wk 12. Follow-ups (06B, 06C, 06D) are done only if H1N1boost is administered. Schedule 06C and 06D at1 wk and 4 wks, respectively, post H1N1 injection with a -1 to +2 day window. Schedule the 06D and 07 follow-up visits with a 7 day window. Subjects who receive licensed H1N1 vaccine outside of VRC Clinic may consent to provide research samples (visits 06C/06D) without diary card completion. HLA type is generally done at Visit 02, but may be done at a later visit instead. 2 ",
