Nurse: patient ratio was 4:22 during OV compared to 3:18 during PRAE-OV. Cumulative incidence of MDRGN was 4.7% in OV and 2.4% POST-OV compared to 4.8% to PRAE-OV, respectively, without any significant variations. During OV and POST-OV, septic episodes due to MDRGN were not observed. In one case, potential nosocomial transmission of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to Piperacillin and 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins was observed. Conclusions: Prevention of nosocomial spread of MDRGN in an overcrowded NIMCU is based on staff's diligent training and adequate staffing. Concise microbiological surveillance should be guaranteed to escort through overcrowding periods. In our setting, impact of bed-to-bed distance on MDRGN transmission seemed to be less strong.",

Since MDRGN frequently cause community and healthcare-associated infections in almost all countries and medical disciplines [9] [10] [11] , efforts to prevent infections caused by MDRGN should therefore not only address adequate usage of antibiotics and the development of strategies to prevent spread of MDRGN, but also on enhancement of the knowledge of MDRGN transmission, especially in hospital settings. Overcrowding has been shown to promote the spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in medical wards [12] [13] [14] .",

Given the nearly continuous maximally occupancy of NICU beds at any paediatric hospital in the Rhine-Main area, transferring neonates to other NICU/NIMCUs was less likely. Therefore, all neonates meeting the entry criteria for NIMCU were transferred from PICU to NIMCU at UHF. This period took 25 days under which the ward was scheduled under overcrowded conditions. During OV, number of beds increased from n = 18 to n = 22; bed to bed-distance decreased to 1.0-1.2 m. Considering that distance between NICU and NIMCU beds has been recommended to be 2 m at least [23] [24] [25] [26] , OV resulted in a infectiologically risky setting.",
