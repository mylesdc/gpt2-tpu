Recently, the prevailing hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote inflammation was challenged when polymorphisms in Ncf1, that decrease oxidative burst, were shown to increase disease severity in mouse and rat arthritis models. Based on these findings we developed a new therapy for arthritis using oxidative burst-inducing substances.",

Importantly, phytol treatment also decreased the autoimmune response and ameliorated both the acute and chronic phases of arthritis. When compared to standard therapies for RA, anti-tumour necrosis factor-a and methotrexate, phytol showed equally good or better therapeutic properties. Finally, phytol mediated its effect within hours of administration and involved modulation of T cell activation, as injection prevented adoptive transfer of disease with arthritogenic T cells.",

The therapy of RA is mainly based on methotrexate (MTX) and biological agents that directly target molecules involved in the pathogenesis of RA-e.g., the human soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor etanercept (Enbrel). However, cytokines targeted with such biological agents also play a general role in the immune defence, and the risk of infections increases with use of these agents [1] . Therefore, a continued search for successful therapies for RA is extremely important.",

In addition, the search for genes predisposing for autoimmunity has so far had limited success [3] [4] [5] [6] . Recently, neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1) was identified by positional cloning as a gene controlling arthritis severity in rats [7] . Ncf1 (alias p47phox) is an important subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex responsible for the one-electron reduction of oxygen that ultimately yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) [8, 9] . This oxidative burst process is used by phagocytes primarily to kill invading pathogens [10] . The surprising finding with the Ncf1 polymorphism in the susceptible Dark Agouti (DA) rat was that increased susceptibility to arthritis was associated with low oxidative burst capacity [7] , contradicting the hypothesis in current use that high levels of free radicals promotes inflammation [11] . This finding led us to propose that substances that increase the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex could ameliorate and possibly prevent severe arthritis. In this study we used rats as an experimental model of RA to identify compounds that increase oxidative burst capacity in vivo and investigate whether these substances thereby could have a therapeutic effect on arthritis.",

We had already seen that certain oils with an alkane structure, such as phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol) and pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane), had an oxidative burst-inducing capacity in vitro. Additionally, despite structural similarity, pristane induced arthritis, whereas phytol protected against it [7] . To examine the structure/function relationship we screened a number of short saturated alkanes (C8-C17) using an isoluminol-based oxidative burst assay [14] on human promyelocytes (HL-60) differentiated to granulocytes in the presence of DMSO. Alkanes 11-13 carbons long were the most potent in activating the NADPH oxidase complex ( Figure 1A ). To investigate their arthritogenic potential, we injected the alkanes into arthritis-susceptible DA rats carrying the DA Ncf1 allele (Ncf1 DA ). Alkanes with 15 carbons or more, such as pristane, induced arthritis, whereas shorter alkanes did not ( Figure 1B) . We therefore concluded that the arthritisinducing effect of these oils is independent of their oxidative burst-inducing capacity.",

Similar results were also seen with C12 and C13 (unpublished data). In contrast, C16, which was arthritogenic and did not increase oxidative burst, did not protect against arthritis ( Figure 1C ). These results clearly demonstrate that small changes in structure determine the effect of the molecule. Since phytol was superior in inducing oxidative burst in vitro as well as in preventing arthritis when injected before induction of disease ( Figure 1A and 1D) , it was chosen for further studies of efficacy. We then investigated the dependency of arthritis-preventing effects on route of administration. When phytol was administered SC, IP, or intranasally 5 d before and after PIA induction it was evident that SC administration resulted in the best preventive effect ( Figure 1E ).",

An increase in oxidative burst capacity was evident the day after phytol (but not after pristane injection) and persisted for several weeks ( Figure 2C ).

Also after PMA stimulation, phytol-primed granulocytes had a higher response capacity ( Figure 3A ), whereas T cells showed only a barely detectable increase in ROS production ( Figure 3B) . Compared to the level of oxidative burst in granulocytes, T cells are minor producers of ROS ( Figure 3C ). T cells were also stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3, but this did not further increase the ROS production ( Figure S1 ). The increase in T cell oxidative burst could be a reflection of contaminating ROS from granulocytes. B/T cell ratio was altered after phytol injection ( Figure 3D ), presumably through an increase of B cell number, because a tendency towards higher levels of IgG and IgM was also seen ( Figure 3E ). The same tendency was seen after phytol treatment in PIA (unpublished data). Alternatively, the increased B/T ratio could have resulted from decreased T cell numbers. Phytol did not significantly alter T cell distribution, as no effect on the ratio of CD4/CD8 was seen (unpublished data). To investigate whether the change in cell distribution was due to phytol toxicity we analyzed the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic T cells ex vivo 5 d after injection. Levels of dead T cells did not increase ( Figure 3F ), suggesting that the increased B/T ratio or the disease-preventing effect is not mediated via increased depletion of T cells.",

A significant decrease in arthritis severity comparable to the effect on PIA was observed after preventive administration of phytol also in CIA ( Figure 4A ). Importantly, phytol suppressed the autoimmune response, as plasma levels of CII specific antibodies on day 27 after immunization were reduced ( Figure 4B ). Levels of anti-CII of all isotypes were decreased after phytol treatment; also IgM response was lower ( Figure 4B ), suggesting no shift in T cell response. However, total IgG and IgM levels were not affected ( Figure 4C ), arguing for a specific effect of phytol on CIIreactive cells. As IgG anti-CII response is T cell-dependent, these data indicate a lower activity of CII autoreactive T helper cells.",

Thus we tested the efficacy of phytol in both acute and chronic phases of PIA. To test phytol in the acute phase, rats were treated twice with 5 d between injections, starting at the peak of the disease (around day 22). Phytol injection markedly decreased arthritis severity ( Figure 5A) . A decrease in circulating COMP-a measurement of ongoing cartilage destruction [19] -occurred after treatment ( Figure 5B ). To determine the therapeutic efficiency in the chronic phase of PIA, phytol was injected two times with 3 d between injections starting when the disease has passed the first phase and relapses were observed (around day 70). The chronic phase is quite different from the acute phase and is controlled by a different set of genes [25] . Importantly, a significant decrease in arthritis severity in treated rats was observed ( Figure 5C ). Our results clearly show that phytol not only has preventive effects but is therapeutic all along the disease course. Histopathologic analysis of paws from rats treated either before or during the acute phase of PIA revealed an effect on both inflammation and joint destruction ( Figure 5D ). In sections taken from rats treated in the acute phase of disease a mild inflammation could be seen together with remnants of earlier, more severe inflammation. Rats treated before onset showed no signs of inflammation.",

As with DA.Ncf1 DA rats, LEW.1F rats were also protected from arthritis after a preventive phytol injection ( Figure 5E ). Treatment with oxidative burst inducers was thus far done by increasing ROS production in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. Next we wanted to investigate whether rats expressing the Ncf1 E3 allele could be treated successfully with phytol. Since it has been shown that one allele of Ncf1 E3 is enough to restore the oxidative burst and to prevent arthritis in DA.Ncf1 DA rats [7] , we used a DA double congenic rat strain expressing not only Ncf1 E3/DA but also a congenic fragment on Chromosome 6 allowing arthritis development [12] . Also in these rats, phytol treatment in acute phase of disease resulted in a significant decrease in disease severity ( Figure 5F ). These are important findings indicating that phytol can also be therapeutic in individuals with a ''normal'' oxidative burst capacity.",

When donor splenocytes were analyzed for oxidative burst on day 10, rats given phytol up to 3 d before sacrifice had a higher level of intrinsic oxidative burst (without PMA stimulation in vitro) ( Figure 7D) . No difference in oxidative burst was seen after PMA stimulation, possibly due to the proximity to arthritis onset (unpublished data). Interestingly, none of the rats receiving cells from phytol-treated donors developed arthritis, even if the phytol treatment was given as late as 3 h before sacrifice ( Figure 7E ). Together with the observation that no increase in oxidative burst capacity occurred in spleen cells from these rats, this argues that ROS-producing cells affect the arthritogenic T cells in vitro, or that the NADPH oxidase activation is transferred to the recipient. However, when oxidative burst was measured in recipients 2 d after transfer, no differences were seen (unpublished data) and when the recipient rats were reimmunized with pristane, all groups developed arthritis (unpublished data) excluding transfer of regulatory T cells.",

The ROS-inducing compound phytol showed comparable or better therapeutic effects in comparison with two of the major drugs used for RA today, i.e., etanercept and MTX, further confirming its possible therapeutic efficacy. Phytol successfully ameliorated arthritis not only in rats with low ROS production but also in rats with normal oxidative burst response, in rats with a different genetic background, and in different models such as PIA, CIA, NOCIA, and adoptive transfer models.

We believe that this is not the case, as we did not observe any pathogenic infections in the rats. Also preliminary data suggest that mice with an Ncf1 mutation showed similar arthritis susceptibility in both conventional and SPF conditions (unpublished data).

Although granulocytes are the main ROSproducing cell type, a preventive effect on arthritogenic T cells could clearly be seen after treatment. This preventive effect could be mediated at several different stages. It has been shown that coincubation of T cells with ROS-producing granulocytes inhibits cytokine production [34] . Also, T cell expansion [35] and apoptosis [36] are affected by altered levels of oxygen radicals. The increased ROS production seen after phytol treatment could in addition change the general oxidation status of T cells and thereby mediate suppression. Oxidation of proteins on cell surfaces has been shown to be crucial for function, e.g., the protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is highly sensitive to redox alterations, resulting in lower T cell receptor signalling after oxidation [37] . A reducing environment has also been shown to be important for T cell proliferation [38] . T cells have themselves been proposed to express the components of the NADPH oxidase complex and to produce ROS [39] . We measured an increased oxidative burst in T cells after phytol treatment, but to a dramatically lower level than that of granulocytes. This increased ROS could be a result of ROS leaking from surrounding granulocytes or produced by other oxidative burst mechanisms independent of Ncf1. We could not exclude, however, the possibility that the T cell oxidative burst has an effect on autoimmunity by itself. T cells are likely to be regulated by ROS produced extracellularly from other cells, such as the Ncf1-dependent activities of antigenpresenting cells and granulocytes, as well as by internal mitochondrial activities. For example, protein tyrosine phosphatases, regulators of a wide array of cellular signalling pathways, can be inactivated by oxidation [40] , which is interesting because a polymorphism in PTPN22 has been shown to be associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases, including RA [41] . This mutation leads to a more potent negative effect on T cell receptor signalling akin to what can be envisioned by a reduced cysteine in the combining site of the protein tyrosine phosphatases.",

Thymus could also be affected by this treatment. Altered oxidation status could affect the depletion of autoreactive T cells and the activation threshold of autoreactive T cells, resulting in a lower level of autoreactivity. Ultimately, phytol affected development of arthritogenic T cells very rapidly. As early as 3 h after phytol injection it was no longer possible to transfer disease from pristane-injected rats. The arthritis-preventive effect in adoptive transfer probably operates through down-regulation of arthritogenic T cells and is not mediated by ROSproducing cells in vitro or in the recipient, since the mix of treated and untreated cells transferred arthritis, and no alterations of oxidative burst occurred in the recipient after transfer. The early preventive effect seen after phytol is likely not mediated via induction of oxidative burst in T cells, since the effect is lost in phytol-primed T cells cultured together with arthritogenic T cells. These findings also exclude transfer of regulatory T cells, since recipients developed PIA in a normal manner. (C) Phytol inhibits arthritogenic T cells when injected in the donor DA.Ncf1 DA rat.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic illness that affects between 0.3% and 1% of people worldwide, causing pain and swelling in joints, tendons, and other tissues, and frequently leading to permanent deformity and disability. RA involves an abnormal attack by cells of the immune system against the body's own connective tissues (so-called autoimmunity). Current drugs for RA work by counteracting the molecules that cause the pain and swelling (inflammation). By reducing the severity of autoimmune inflammation, these drugs may also reduce the disease's long-term damage to joints.",

As part of their activity against disease-causing bacteria, the white blood cells known as granulocytes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), sometimes known as ''free radicals.'' After engulfing invading bacteria, neutrophils release an ''oxidative burst'' of ROS-essentially the subcellular equivalent of pouring hydrogen peroxide on a wound to disinfect it. A complex of molecules known collectively as the NADPH oxidase complex has the specific function of generating ROS to fuel the oxidative burst. Interestingly, recent experiments in arthritis-prone rats found that animals with an altered form of one of the subunits of this complex, Ncf1, that decreased the production of ROS also had greater susceptibility to arthritis. This finding was surprising because free radicals have generally been associated with inflammation and long-term damage to cells, so that a reduction in ROS might have been expected to decrease susceptibility to an inflammatory disease like RA.",

(F) Phytol has an arthritis-ameliorating effect in rats that have a functional oxidative burst. Rats heterozygous for the functional Ncf1 (Ncf1 E3 ) allele with an arthritis susceptibility locus on Chromosome 6 were injected IP (200 ll) with phytol at the estimated peak of disease (day 24, arrow; control, n \u00bc 13; phytol, n \u00bc 15). (G) Histamine dihydrochloride reverses the ameliorating effect of phytol, possibly by blocking oxidative burst. Injection of histamine twice (200 ll SC and IP), with 5 d between injections (arrows), starting 10 d after phytol treatment (day 26 after pristane) in DA.Ncf1 DA rats could reverse the arthritisameliorating effect (n \u00bc 5).
