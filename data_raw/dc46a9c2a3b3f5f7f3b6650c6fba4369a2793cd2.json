For the stability and synthesis 4 assays, ERI3 knockdown was performed using two independent siRNAs 5 (siERI3_III and siERI3_VII) transfected 48 hours prior to infection. Cells were 6 infected with DENV-2 using an MOI of 1.0 and incubated for 16 hours before 7 addition of NITD008 (25 \u00b5M final concentration). For the stability assay, time 8 points were harvested as described above. For the synthesis assay, four hours 9 after drug addition, infected cells were pulse-labeled with 2 mM BrU for 30 10 minutes and harvested for total RNA 2 . Nascent transcripts were 11 immunoprecipitated using a BrU-specific antibody and quantified by qPCR for 12 GAPDH or DENV-2 RNA. As shown in S4 Figure A , the BrU antibody 13 significantly enriched for GAPDH transcripts compared to the IgG control with or 14 without the addition of NITD008. In addition, there was no significant difference 15 in enrichment for GAPDH RNA with or without NITD008 (Tukey's post-test, NS). 16",

We 3 tested a series of EGFP-ERI3 fusion proteins for their ability to colocalize with the 4 Golgi marker TGON2; EGFP fusion constructs were generated that contain the 5 full-length ERI3 sequence (aa 1-337), the C-terminal exonuclease domain (aa 6 136-337), or N-terminal sequences (aa 1-135 and aa 1-44) (S5 Fig. A) . HuH-7 7 cells were transfected with EGFP fusion constructs and probed with antibodies to 8 EGFP, ERI3 and TGON2. EGFP fusion protein containing full-length ERI3 9 localized throughout the cell and colocalized with TGON2 (S5 Fig. B ). In contrast, 10 EGFP fused to ERI3 aa 136-337 localized primarily to the nucleus and showed 11 no overlap with native ERI3 or TGON2 (S5 Fig. B ). It should be noted that the 12 ERI3 antibody was generated using aa 1-135, therefore proteins lacking these 13 sequences are not detected. In contrast, EGFP fused to ERI3 aa 1-135 localized 14 primarily to the cytoplasm and had a similar localization pattern as native ERI3 15 and TGON2 (S5 Fig. B) . The localization to the Golgi structures was abolished in 16 a more abbreviated C-terminal truncation in which EGFP was fused to ERI3 aa 17 1-44, which had a diffuse staining pattern in the cell (S5 Fig. B) . These data 18 suggest that N-terminal sequences program ERI3 for localization to Golgi 19 structures. The results of four independent experiments are shown. We tested the 7 knockdown efficiency and found that AAEL007801 RNA was reduced to 49% of 8 the GFP control level. The Mann-Whitney U Test was applied and asterisks 9 indicate **p<0.01.
