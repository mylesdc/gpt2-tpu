            "text": "Viral defense at mucosal sites depends on interferons (IFN) and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), either of which may be constitutively expressed to maintain an \"antiviral state\" (AVS). However, the mechanisms that govern the AVS are poorly defined. Using a BEAS-2B respiratory epithelial cell line deficient in IRF1, we demonstrate higher susceptibility to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza virus. IRF1-mediated restriction of VSV is IFN-independent, as blockade of types I and III IFNs and JAK-STAT signaling before infection did not affect VSV infection of either parent or IRF1 KO cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IRF1 regulates constitutive expression of \u223c300 genes, including antiviral ISGs: OAS2, BST2, and RNASEL and knockdown of any of these IRF1-dependent genes increased VSV infection. Additionally, IRF1 enhances rapid expression of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb after stimulation with poly I:C and also regulates ISG expression. Mechanistically, IRF1 enhances recruitment of BRD4 to promotor-enhancer regions of ISGs for rapid expression and maintains levels of histone H3K4me1 for optimal constitutive expression. Finally, IRF1 also regulates constitutive expression of TLR2 and TLR3 and promotes signaling through these pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These data reveal multiple roles for IRF1 toward effective anti-viral responses by maintaining IFN-independent constitutive expression of anti-viral ISGs and supporting early IFN-dependent responses to PRR stimulation.",

The interaction between viral pathogens and epithelial cells often determines the outcome of viral infection, either directly or by modulating the subsequent adaptive immune response. The first step in viral defense is recognition of viral nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB to induce expression of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb, along with a variety of anti-viral and immunomodulatory interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) that directly or indirectly suppress viral infection (1, 2) . Since viral pathogens express proteins to block IFN and ISG functions, innate antiviral immunity is only effective when rapidly implemented. To give the host a head-start, cells acquire an \"antiviral state\" by expressing ISGs constitutively (i.e., independent of IFNs) or in response to constitutive expression of IFN\u03b2 (3-5). IFN-independent constitutive expression of ISGs is appealing because the AVS is acquired without the detrimental bystander effects associated with aberrant IFN expression (6) . While the benefits of an IFN-independent AVS are known, molecular mechanisms that regulate it remain undefined.",

In support of an important role for IRF1 in viral defense, ectopic expression of IRF1 protects otherwise susceptible cells against a diverse range of RNA viruses (8) , and IRF1 deficient mice are more susceptible to viral infections (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . How IRF1 participates in antiviral defense is unclear (12) , in part because its effects are limited to specific tissue sites and may differ according to the viral pathogen. For example, although IRF1 deficient mice succumb to EMCV infection faster than wild type mice, wild type and IRF1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are equally susceptible to EMCV, and neither IRF1 KO mice nor MEFs are susceptible to VSV (12) . Adding to the mechanistic complexity is that IRF1 may mediate IFN-dependent or independent responses, by regulating temporal-spatial ISG expression in response to IFNs or enhancing expression of antiviral genes induced by PRR stimulation, respectively. Here we reveal a common epigenetic mechanism of action for IFN-dependent and independent roles for IRF1 using an IRF1-deficient bronchial epithelial cell line.",

Figures 1A-C shows that compared to parent cells, IRF KO BEAS-2B cells were highly infected with VSV-GFP. IRF1 KO cells were also more susceptible to infection with multiple strains of influenza viruses ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figures 2A-D) . A second IRF1 KO BEAS-2B cell line also showed increased susceptibility to VSV infection (Supplementary Figure 2E) . To confirm that increased infectivity was due to deletion of IRF1, we transduced cells with a bicistronic lentivirus that expresses tagRFP and IRF1 or as a control, tagRFP and firefly luciferase (lv-IRF1 and lv-Fluc, respectively), (8) . In both parent and IRF KO cells, lv-IRF1, but not lv-Fluc induced expression of high levels of IRF1 that had translocated to the nucleus (Figures 1E,F) . In addition, after lv-IRF1-induced over-expression of IRF1, both parent and IRF1 KO BEAS-2B cells were completely protected against VSV-GFP (Figures 1G,H) . Protection can be achieved either in cis, in which all cells overexpress IRF1, or trans, in which IRF1 expression by a subset of cells induces an AVS throughout the culture. To determine which of these was operative in VSV infection, we measured expression of tagRFP and GFP by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1I , transfection with lv-IRF1 induced expression of RFP in only \u223c4% of the IRF1 KO and overexpression of IRF1 in \u223c9% of the parent cells, but in each case the RFP \u2212 (i.e., without IRF1 overexpression) cells were also protected from VSV-GFP infection, suggesting a strong trans effect.",

Thus, to explore whether IRF1 also directly regulates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, we asked if exogenous IFNs differentially affects infection of IRF1 KO and parent cells with VSV, a pathogen that is highly sensitive to exogenous type I and III IFNs (14, 15) .

We first determined optimal doses of B18R-a high-affinity soluble IFNAR1 analog, and Y136a soluble receptor for types I and III IFNs, and two JAK inhibitors, ruxolitinib and AZD1480 (Supplementary Figure 4) .

BST2 (also known as CD317 or tetherin) prevents release of budding virus from infected cells (16) . All three OAS gene products, OAS1-3, catalyze the synthesis of 2' ,5'-oligoadenylates , but may also serve non-redundant functions, and only OAS2 is constitutively expressed by BEAS-2B cells (17) . The 2-5As activate RNase L to inhibit viral replication by non-selectively degrading host and viral RNA (18, 19) . To further provide a proof of concept that IRF1 dependent genes are indeed antiviral, we explored the importance of these three IRF1-dependent genes by knocking down expression of each in the parent BEAS-2B cells with siRNA before infecting with VSV-GFP. Figure 6 shows that siOAS2, siBST2, and siRNASEL each reduced expression of their target mRNAs and increased VSV-GFP infection compared to the control siRNA treated cells. Therefore, IRF1 maintains the antiviral state of BEAS-2B cells to restrict VSV infection in part by driving constitutive expression of at least three antiviral genes, BST2, OAS2, and RNASEL. Taken together, our selective knockdown of this small subset of the \u223c300 DEGs demonstrates that IRF1 maintains constitutive expression of antiviral genes, which is one of the many mechanisms by which respiratory epithelial cells may be protected from viral infection.",

We validated these RNA-seq results and found decreased constitutive expression of TLR3 and TLR2 proteins and verified decreased constitutive mRNA expression of S100A9 by IRF1 KO cells (Supplementary Figures 8A-C) . While transfection with poly I:C activates cytoplasmic RIG-I or MDA-5, simple addition of poly I:C to cells selectively activates TLR3, which resides in endosomes (21). Figure 7A shows that addition of poly I:C for 6h induced robust expression of four ISGs in parent, but not in IRF1 KO cells. Since constitutive expression of each of these four ISGs is unaffected by IRF1 deficiency, constitutive expression and optimal localization of TLR3 are additional IFN-independent mechanisms by which IRF1 mediates antiviral immunity.",

By inducing expression of IRF7, type I interferons also amplify their own expression, as well as that of type III IFNs (IFN\u03bb). Since IRF7 is not constitutively expressed by respiratory epithelial cells, their antiviral defenses may lag behind expression of viral encoded antagonists of antiviral ISGs. Therefore, respiratory epithelial cells must rely on alternative mechanisms, such as enhanced basal expression of ISGs, to block viral replication. To explore the role for IRF1 in antiviral defense, we used BEAS-2B cells as a model because these immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells respond to viral pathogens similarly to that of primary bronchial epithelial cells (26) (27) (28) . BEAS-2B respiratory epithelial cells constitutively express IRF1, and its expression is rapidly enhanced in response to type I IFNs and PRR stimulation (7, 29) , two features that suggest a role in early antiviral host defense. In support of the importance of IRF1 in host defense are recent reports that rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus indirectly suppress IFN\u03bb expression by suppressing IRF1 (30, 31) . Using an IRF1-deficient BEAS-2B cell line, we demonstrate that: (1) In response to PRR stimulation, IRF1 supports early expression of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1/2, STAT1/2 activation, and ISG expression;",

While optimal IFN expression after PRR stimulation may require IRF1, its role in viral infection has been questioned, in part because antiviral defense and IFN expression were not impaired in IRF1 KO mice (11, 34) . In support of a role for IRF1 in IFN expression, we found that over-expression of IRF1 in a subset of cells rendered the IRF1-nontransduced cells also resistant to viral infection. Here we also show that while constitutive IRF1 enhances early IFN expression, parent and IRF1 KO cells similarly expressed IFN 24 h after PRR stimulation. It is likely, therefore, that whether the IFN-dependent or -independent functions of IRF1 are relevant to viral defense depends upon cell type, the viral pathogen, infectious dose, and duration of infection. For example, VSV replicates quickly, blocks IFN signaling, and shuts down host translational machinery, so it is unsurprising that even though the parent cells express IFNB1, IFNL1, and IFNL2, the proteins were undetectable, and that blockade of JAK signaling did not enhance VSV infection. Additionally, our data may apply only to local defenses at target cells for viral infection.",

BST2 (tetherin) is an IFN inducible protein that prevents release of wide range of enveloped viral particles including HIV, VSV, and Ebola (43) by retaining fully formed viral particles inside the cell preventing their spread. Because of its direct interactions, BST2 is also under positive selection and differs among species (44) . The OAS family of consists of OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3, which patrol for cytoplasmic dsRNA (45) . Upon binding dsRNA, each of the three OAS proteins activate the endoribonuclease RNase L, which indiscriminately degrades cellular and viral RNA (19, 45) . While all three OAS family members are ISGs, only OAS2 is transcriptionally regulated by IRF1. OAS family genes are divergent in sequence and all the OAS paralogs as well as RNase L proteins are under constant selective pressure (46, 47) . Selective pressure may be higher for OAS2 suggesting higher importance among the three OAS proteins (46) . RNase L is regulated by at least two mechanisms: transcriptional regulation by IRF1 and functional responsiveness to OAS2 levels (48) . Because of its direct involvement in degrading viral RNAs, domains of RNase L that detect environmental cues and degrade viral RNA have rapidly evolved in mammals (47) . Furthermore, by associating with cytoskeletal proteins, RNase L provides a barrier to viral entry independent of its catalytic function (49) , thus suggesting an additional mechanism by which IRF1 mediates viral restriction.",

TLR3 is an important PRR that recognizes viral PAMPs early during infection because it is localized to early endosomes, which are hijacked by viruses for cellular entry. Since TLR3 activates IRF3, modulation of TLR3 expression applies to both IFN-dependent and independent antiviral defense. However, studies showing transcriptional or positional regulation of TLR3 are limited. Recently, Sun and colleagues reported that TLR3 is regulated by a complex of IRF1, IRF2 and host cell factor C2 (HCFC2) in murine monocytic cells (51) . However, patterns of TLR3 expression are cell and species dependent (52, 53) . For example, unlike murine monocytic cells, types I and III IFNs do not enhance expression of TLR3 in epithelial cells. By contrast, Bose and coworkers showed that S100A9 regulates intracellular trafficking of TLR3 in murine bone marrow derived macrophages (20) . Since expression of S100A9 is decreased and TLR3 poorly localizes to the endosomes in IRF1 KO cells, maintaining proper TLR3 localization is another method by which IRF1 enhances anti-viral defenses.",
