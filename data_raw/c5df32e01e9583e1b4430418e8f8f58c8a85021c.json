The capacity to rapidly assess SNPs that correlate with disease predisposition, drug efficacy and drug toxicity is a key step for the development of personalized medicine. In this work, a rapid one-step SNP detection method, real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), was first applied for CYP2C19 polymorphisms testing. The optimized method was established with specifically designed primers for target amplification by real-time detection in approximately 30 min under isothermal conditions. RT-LAMP amplified few copies of template to produce significant amounts of product and quantitatively detected human DNA with compatible specificity and sensitivity. The success in the establishment of this RT-LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 polymorphism testing is significant for the extension of this technique for the detection of other SNPs, which will further facilitate the development of personalized medicine. OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Evaluation of RT-LAMP using peripheral blood samples. To evaluate the feasibility of RT-LAMP in clinical applications, 100 peripheral blood samples were tested with Tris-EDTA buffer as the negative control. All of the samples were also further verified by conventional PCR and direct sequencing.",

Although these technologies are currently considered the gold standard for laboratory-based DNA detection and diagnostics, these methods cannot meet the requirements of point-of-care testing (POCT) strategies 8 due to the high set up and operating expenses and the requirements for high-precision equipment. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an outstanding gene amplification procedure with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity that was established by Notomi et al. 9 . The process amplifies nucleic acids under isothermal conditions and employs self-recurring strand-displacement synthesis primed by a specially designed set of target-specific primers 10 , thus clearly distinguishing this technique from existing genetic tests 11 . LAMP is characterized by the use of six specifically designed primer regions to recognize eight regions on the target DNA; thus, the specificity is extremely high 11 . Amplification and detection of a gene can be completed in a one step by incubating the mixture of sample, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates under isothermal conditions between 60 and 65 \u00b0C. LAMP has been used for the diagnosis of pathogens via the detection of gene segments, e.g., the diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as Japanese encephalitis virus infection 12 , rapid genotyping of carcinogenic human papillomavirus and herpesvirus 12 , and the detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [12] [13] [14] . Numerous investigations have demonstrated that this special identification system is more accurate than PCR-based methods, which use only two primers to recognize two regions.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , the basic principle of RT-LAMP involves the use of specific primers, with a forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) that are designed to contain a SNP nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus, each reaction including two common primers (F3 and B3) and two specific primers (FIP-G and BIP-G for G allele and FIP-A and BIP-A for A allele). The structures of the LAMP primers and products based on this study are presented in Fig. 1 , and the information regarding the primer names and sequences are provided in Table 1 . The target SNP was characterized using six different regions (F1/F1c-F3/F3c and B1/B1c-B3/B3c) specifically designed to recognize distinct regions on the target gene, which were designed to ensure that the primers would specifically amplify the G681A and G636A substitutions. The results depicted in Fig. 2 illustrate that the RT-LAMP method could accurately detect and discriminate all possible homozygotes and heterozygotes of CYP2C19*2 (G681A) and CYP2C19*3 (G636A) SNPs. Sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay. The sensitivities of the RT-LAMP assay were tested using 10-fold serial dilutions of the four constructed plasmids. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 1 \u00d7 10 1 copies of plasmid (the result for the CYP2C19 G681G plasmid is presented in Fig. 3A ; the results for the other three plasmids are presented in supplementary Fig. S1 ), indicating that the RT-LAMP method was efficient and specific in SNP detection under a constant temperature with greater than 10-fold increased sensitivity compared with conventional PCR 23, 24 . Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 , a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions of plasmids and calculated by regression analysis comparing the T peek with the copy number. The high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.995) indicated that the RT-LAMP assay could be applied in DNA quantification.",

The LAMP technique is a unique assay with high efficiency and high accuracy that was developed rapidly. As described in some reports [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [26] [27] [28] [29] , the LAMP assay has been widely used in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports regarding the detection of mutations in human genomic DNA, especially SNPs, using the LAMP method are lacking. In this study, the successful establishment of an inexpensive, rapid and real-time LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 SNP genotyping expanded the scope of application of this technique to human gene mutation detection. RT-LAMP is a one-step method wherein the amplification itself is the signal for SNP detection, whereas the difficulty in developing this technology involves the suppression of non-specific amplification 30 . To help overcome this difficulty, the target SNP is characterized using six different primer regions specifically designed to recognize eight distinct regions on the target gene 14, 30 . In this work, by adding or subtracting a few nucleotides in the primer regions, the T m value and GC content were calculated until the six different primer regions were suitable for the LAMP reaction. As a result, the primer regions were selected as noted in Fig. 1 (F1-F3 and B1-B3) . Furthermore, as the arrangement and composition of human genomic DNA is very complex, sequence alignment was necessary to avoid false recognition of the specific site. Thus, Primer-BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) was used to ensure that the chosen primer regions were specific to the target SNP, which helped avoid mismatches and locate the target SNP as accurately as possible.",

Hence, the inner primers were designed (Fig. 1) to minimize the impact of the secondary structure given that the inner primers are the main component for DNA strand extension. Moreover, according to Tomita et al., the formation of a starting structure is the key initiating step of LAMP 11 . Specific nucleotides were added to the 5\u2032 termini (5\u2032 -term) of the FIP and BIP primers to establish a complete and effective starting structure, as shown in Fig. 1 . Consequently the starting structure would be successfully established only when the 5\u2032 -term nucleotide was exactly matched with the target SNP (Fig. 1A) . Otherwise, the starting structure was blocked, as shown in Fig. 1C , and the amplification could not proceed. In conclusion, non-specific amplification was effectively suppressed in this work through special primer design and accurate target location. In addition, using real-time fluorescence detection equipment, amplification and detection can be performed in a closed tube, which could reduce the risk of contamination.",

Thus, this POC detection method should be helpful in basic research in a variety of fields, including medicine, pharmaceuticals, environmental hygiene, food security, and pharmacogenomics testing.",
