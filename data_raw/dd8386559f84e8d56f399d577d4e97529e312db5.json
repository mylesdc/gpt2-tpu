The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.",

For example, vomiting was more commonly reported among children with Flu-A, RSV-A, Parainfluenza-1 and B. pertussis (Additional file 4: Table S4 -A). However, the difficulty in establishing clear clinical symptoms associated with infectious causal agents is due to the high frequency of coinfections. Therefore, Additional file 4: Table S4 -B has recorded the clinical symptoms of cases of infection with a single agent, and the association of these clinical symptoms are shown in Fig. 2 . Thus, a clear non-association can be observed between Mycoplasma and Flu-B, ADV or Bordetella; the same happens for Flu-B and Bordetella or ADV.

Viral RNA/DNA obtained after extraction was eluted in 100 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water and then processed or stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C until use.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the analysis of respiratory viruses RT-PCR for Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B and Adenovirus virus were performed using a BHQ quencher probe at 125 nM and 250 nM of primers in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. Five microliters of the extracted RNA was combined with 15 \u03bcl of the master mix. RT-PCR conditions was 60 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 45 s at 60\u00b0C. This process was performed in Light Cycler\u00ae 2.0 Instrument and the data was analyzed with the LightCycler\u00ae Software 4.1 (Roche Diagnostic, Deutschland-Mannheim, Germany). The primers and the probe for Influenza A and B were described by Selvaraju et al., 2010 [23], for RSV-A and RSV-B were described by Liu W. et al., 2016 [24] and for Adenovirus was described by Heim et al., 2003 [25]. For he case of Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus and Parainfluenza 3, the primers and conditions for RT-PCR were described by Coiras et al., 004 [26]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the analysis of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis Polymerase chain reaction was performed with 5 \u03bcL of template DNA, polymerase (GoTaq; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The Primers and conditios used for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae were descrited by del Valle et al.; 2017 [11] and primers and conditions used for Bordetella pertussis were describe by Castillo et al., 2015",
