Umrah is an Islamic pilgrimage to Makkah, which occurs at times other than the period of the Hajj-the period of Ramadan (fasting month) is considered the peak period [2] .

            "text": "Because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found in the western Arabian Peninsula [7] , there is potential for arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika virus infection, yellow fever, and chikungunya to be introduced to Saudi Arabia through Hajj and Umrah activities. This is especially the case when infected individuals, often from Asia, enter Saudi Arabia through Jeddah, the major airport servicing the Hajj and Umrah (Fig 1) . The first imported dengue cases from Zanzibar to the Arabian Peninsula were reported in the 19th century, notably in Yemen in 1872 and again in 1877 [8] . It is believed that dengue may have recently emerged through an Asian entry pathway in 1994 when dengue outbreaks were reported and found to be caused by dengue virus-1 (DENV-1) and DENV-2 [5, 7, 9] . Subsequently, DENV-3 may have been introduced in 1997 [9] , with all three serotypes still circulating in western Saudi Arabia. Using full genome and envelope (E) gene sequencing of DENV-2 strains in Saudi Arabia, it has been suggested that there continues to be multiple dengue introductions, most recently from the Indian subcontinent, most likely Pakistan, in 2014 [9, 10] . Altogether, there is a high potential that these arboviral diseases could emerge during the Hajj and Umrah. Based on the ease of introduction of dengue into Saudi Arabia, there are concerns that other A. aegypti mosquito-transmitted viruses could follow during Hajj seasons. Of particular concern was the possibility of Zika virus infection emerging as a consequence of mass migrations through Jeddah in 2015-2016 [11, 12] , although there is no evidence for this actually occurring [10] . Yet another concern was reports of a Chinese worker from Angola introducing the first known case of yellow fever in China in 2016 during the large outbreak across West Africa in that year [13, 14] . This prompted vigilance for yellow fever emerging in western Saudi Arabia either through Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, or from sub-Saharan Africa across the Red Sea through multiple points of entry [13, 14] . Adding to the worries was the shortage of yellow fever vaccine reported in that year.",

The Saudi Arabia-Yemen outbreak is believed to be the first and only epizootic of RVF outside of Africa and may have emerged in part from floods due to heavy rains in that year, which helped to promote transmission through Culex triteniorynchus and Aedes vexans arabiensis mosquitoes [15] [16] [17] . The outbreak affected approximately 40,000 animals, especially sheep and goats, with 883 human cases and 124 deaths in Saudi Arabia, together with 1,328 human cases and 166 deaths in Yemen [17] .

Between November and December of 1995, AHFV was isolated for the first time from blood samples of six butchers who worked for a slaughterhouse in Alkhumra (a small town near Makkah) [20] . AHFV is considered to be one of the deadliest viral infections, with the case fatality rate ranging between 25%-30% [20, 21] . According to a Saudi Ministry of Health data set, 281 new cases were confirmed during 2011-2014, and all of these cases had clustered in the Makkah and Najran regions (Fig 1) [22]. Comparative analysis between different tickborne flaviviruses confirmed that AHFV is most closely related to Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), another hemorrhagic fever virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in Karnataka State, India. Genetic distance mapping further indicates that AHFV is a subtype of KFDV, suggesting that the transmission of AHFV occurred from the Indian subcontinent, possibly through the Hajj and animal importation [21] .",

The vast majority of these cases (95%) was due to importation, possibly through Hajj, workers and illegal migrants from South Asian and African nations and Yemen, where malaria is endemic [33] .

Active acquisitions of different resistant genes were observed among returning pilgrims, including genes resistant to the last resort antibiotic (colistin) for Gram-negative bacteria [37] .

The Saudi government's health sector expansion also includes research and development (R&D) capacity building. For example, Saudi Arabia intends to build a national center for vaccine and biologic research and development within King Saud University (KSU) in Riyadh. KSU is a leading university in healthcare research, and in order to support establishing this center, it signed an agreement with the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, focusing on education and training and to support the transfer of technology to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This collaboration will help to train Saudi scientists at various steps of vaccine development and help to establish a parallel vaccine facility in Saudi Arabia. The ultimate goal for the Saudi's national center for vaccine and biologic research and development is to help in the research and development of vaccine candidates against local and regional infectious diseases, including major NTDs in the region. Furthermore, the Saudi Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources is sponsoring a new Saudi Vaccine and Biopharmaceutical Center funded by the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST, the major funding agency for R&D in Saudi) and operated by SaudiVax and PnuVax, applying the concept of government-owned, contractor-operated model (GOCO). The center will have the capacity to scale up cell-based vaccines up to 2,000 L under good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines with approval from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). The idea of the center is to support moving early discoveries from the bench to the market, especially those with low global market value and so week incentives for large multinationals to support. Finally, the Saudi government has formed a thinktank with representatives from the different groups mentioned above and from the policy-making side that is called the \"Saudi Vaccine Alliance.\" This thinktank is used to address matters related to combating new issues and to expand on the Saudi reach to the international scientific community. Similar efforts will be required to expand disease diagnostic capacity. In that context, the Saudi Ministry of Health has recently mandated the expansion of the National Health Laboratory (NHL) located north of Riyadh, with emphasis on increased capacity and scope for its reference diagnostic labs, including three core laboratories: infectious diseases, genetic diseases, and molecular biology systems. The NHL aims to support the Saudi's strategic plans by achieving high standards in scientific research, diagnosis, and disease prevention. The NHL expansion includes the establishment of a new Center for Neglected Tropical Diseases.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of more comprehensive surveillance programs and data collection not only during the Hajj but also around the year to account for Umrah pilgrims. Such programs could monitor for any possible outbreaks for all NTDs highlighted above, with an emphasis on countries with the highest number of pilgrims coming from NTD-endemic nations. In addition, surveillance monitoring will continue to include Hajj and Umrah pilgrims leaving Saudi Arabia and traveling globally. Collectively, these data will enable the policymakers to make informed decisions to control and prevent NTDs in the Middle East and also in all of the Muslim-majority nations comprising the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).",

Through its strategic planning, the Ministry of Health and its research university and institute partners are committed to undertaking a multidimensional approach to disease threats in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the MENA region, and across the OIC nations.",
