RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.",

Viral RNA generated during RSV replication is recognized by host pattern recognition molecules, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and it induces type I and type III interferon [3, 4] . Transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferons is mediated by NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) [5, 6] . These mediators are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of RSV infection, such as mucous hypersecretion, swelling of submucous, and infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages [7] .",

There is evidence for a positive correlation between infections with S. pneumoniae and RSV in the pathogenesis of otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis [8] [9] [10] [11] . S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae colonize to the host respiratory epithelium via host cell surface receptors, such as the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor [12] [13] [14] . These bacteria interact with the PAF receptor via phosphorylcholine, which is a component of the bacterial cell surface. Both live and heat-killed S. pneumoniae cells show an increased adhesion to human epithelial cells infected with RSV [15] . The upregulation of PAF receptor expression that is induced by respiratory virus infections, including those caused by RSV, results in the enhanced adhesion of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to respiratory epithelial cells [15] [16] [17] . PAF receptor expression and S. pneumoniae cell adhesion are also upregulated by exposure to acid, which causes tissue injury and an inflammatory response [18] .",

On the other hand, Wang et al. report that CAM suppressed rhinovirus-induced Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae adhesions to nasal epithelial cells [27] . So we anticipate that CAM suppresses RSV-induced bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells, because expression of PAF receptor is controlled by NF-\u03baB [28, 29] In the present study, we examined the effect of CAM on cytokine production, PAF receptor expression, and RSV infection-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells.",

We examined the adhesion of FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 ) and flow cytometry ( Figure 5 ). RSV infection significantly enhanced the adhesion of S. pneumoniae to A549 cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by adding a PAF receptor antagonist (Figures 4 and 5) or anti-PAF receptor monoclonal antibody (data not shown).

            "text": "Macrolides, with the exception of the 16-membered ring type, have both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial functions [20, 21] . One of the important mechanisms of antiinflammatory action is the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation [22] [23] [24] . Our recent studies show that RSV upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and chemokines, such as IL-8 and RANTES, in the respiratory epithelial cell line A549. Furthermore, the induction of chemokines by RSV is significantly suppressed by an antibiotic, fosfomycin, via suppression of NF-\u03baB activation [25] . In the present study, CAM was shown to suppress IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES, which are induced by RSV infection, at concentrations of 10 and 100 \u03bcg/mL. Patel et al. reported that the concentration of CAM in fluid of the bronchopulmonary epithelial lining was 34.2\u00b15.16 \u03bcg/mL at 4 h, 23.01\u00b111.9 \u03bcg/mL at 12 h in healthy adults orally administered CAM 500 mg [31] . We observed that CAM did not affect RSV replication even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL. However, it is reported that respiratory virus, such as RSV [32] , rhinovirus [33, 34] , and influenza virus [35] , replication is suppressed by 14-membered ring macrolides, including CAM. The reasons of contradictory results between the report of Asada et al. [32] and our present study have been unclear. These two studies used different types of epithelial cells and different experimental conditions of RSV infection. Asada et al. used primary human tracheal epithelial cells, and in contrast we used A549 cell line. Asada et al. carry out infection at a lower titer of RSV (10 \u22123 TCID 50 /cell) and measuring virus titer at a longer period (3-5 days) after infection. Our results indicated that suppression of the RSV-induced cytokines by CAM was not caused by the amount of replicated RSV. In other words, CAM was suggested to have suppressive activity of cytokine production independent of viral replication. Both IL-8 and RANTES, which are strongly upregulated during RSV infection, play important roles in pathogenesis [36, 37] . IL-8 primarily activates neutrophils and promotes their migration. RANTES is secreted from respiratory epithelial cells and promotes migration of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and neutrophils. In particular, RANTES is an efficient eosinophil chemoattractant involved in the pathogenesis of asthma [38] . CAM has been suggested to suppress the inflammatory disorders induced by RSV.",

            "text": "In the present study, we also observed that CAM suppressed enhanced S. pneumoniae adhesion by RSV infection in A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was mainly mediated by host PAF receptor, as indicated by that suppressed by the PAF receptor antagonist and anti-PAF receptor monoclonal antibody. The PAF receptor acts as a receptor for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae [12] [13] [14] . Transcription of the PAF receptor gene is controlled by NF-\u03baB [28, 29] . We confirmed it by that the RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and S. pneumoniae adhesion were suppressed by an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, PDTC. We revealed that CAM also suppressed PAF receptor expression induced by RSV infection and S. pneumoniae adhesion to RSV-infected A549 cells. It should be caused by the suppression of by inhibiting PAF receptor expression. CAM showed more potent suppression of RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines than fosfomycin, as we reported previously [25, 26] . Notably, CAM significantly suppressed RSV-induced IL-6 production, whereas fosfomycin did not significantly [25] . This finding may be caused by that CAM is more potent than fosfomycin; however, the actual reason for this disparity is not clear. The upregulation of PAF receptor expression and the enhanced adhesion of pathogenic bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae, to respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be a major risk factor for secondary bacterial infections after primary respiratory viral infections. CAM may suppress both secondary bacterial infections and immunological disorders induced by RSV, without suppressing viral replication. Infection with other respiratory viruses, such as human parainfluenza virus 3 [16] and rhinovirus [17] , also upregulates known receptors for the pathogenic bacteria, including PAF receptor and S. pneumoniae adhesion. On the other hand, influenza virus does not upregulate the known receptors for bacteria, whereas bacterial adhesion is increased by the infection [16] . McCullers [39] reported that influenza-induced bacterial adhesion to A549 cells was not inhibited by PAF receptor antagonist, and the PAF receptor knock-out mice did not show lower susceptibility to experimental secondary pneumonia caused by S. pneunimoae following influenza infection compared to the parent mice. Lines of evidence suggest that adherent inducing mechanisms of S. pneumoniae to host respiratory epithelial cells are varied among viruses. So CAM may not always suppress virus-induced pathogenic bacteria adhesion.",

NF-\u03baB activated by RSV infection. Recently, Wang et al.[27] reported that CAM suppressed rhinovirus-induced S. aureus and H. influenzae adhesions to nasal epithelial cells. They show that the expressions of fibronectin and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM), which act as receptors for S. aureus and H. influenza, respectively, are induced by rhinovirus and suppressed by CAM. The present study indicated that CAM suppressed the PAF receptor-phosphorylcholine (hostbacteria) interaction, which is enhanced by RSV infection, Effect of CAM and PDTC on RSV-induced PAF receptor expression in A549 cells.
