            "text": "Rotavirus is one of the main causes of acute diarrhea and enteritis in infants. Currently, studies are underway to assess the use of probiotics to improve rotavirus vaccine protection. A previous work demonstrated that the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 is able to hinder rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo. The present study takes a systematic approach in order to identify the molecule directly involved in rotavirus inhibition. Supernatant protease digestions revealed both the proteinaceous nature of the active substance and the fact that the molecule responsible for inhibiting rotavirus replication is released to the supernatant. Following purification by cationic exchange chromatography, active fractions were obtained and the functional compound was identified as an 11-amino acid peptide (MHQPHQPLPPT, named 11-mer peptide) with a molecular mass of 1.282 KDa. The functionality of 11mer was verified using the synthesized peptide in Wa, Ito, and VA70 rotavirus infections of both HT-29 and MA-104 cell lines. Finally, protease activity was detected in B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 supernatant, which releases 11-mer peptide. A preliminary identification of the protease is also included in the study.",

            "text": "Group A rotavirus is one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children, leading to an estimated 2 million hospitalizations per year (Parashar et al., 2006) . Despite the administration of rotavirus vaccines, rotavirus still accounts for an estimated 21.3-39.5% of the hospital admissions for diarrheal disease in Europe (Williams et al., 2009) . However, hospitalizations of older children and adults for diarrhea have greatly decreased after the introduction of infant rotavirus vaccination, which suggests that some rotavirus episodes were transmitted from infants (Lopman et al., 2011) . Rotaviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, inducing diarrhea due to malabsorption by the infected epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa (Kapikian et al., 2001) and increased intestinal motility (Istrate et al., 2014) . The mechanisms underlying diarrhea include secondary malabsorption, patchy lesions, villous atrophy, and disruption of the tight junctions in the small intestine, altered ion channel transport due to the secretion of neurotransmitters (Hagbom et al., 2012) , NSP4 toxicity (Hodges and Gill, 2010) , the activation of the enteric nervous system (Lundgren et al., 2000) , and the expression of aquaporins (Cao et al., 2014) . The process is characterized by profuse diarrhea, which can cause severe dehydration and, in the case of non-intervention, lead to death (Parashar et al., 2006) . Several vaccines have been developed, demonstrating different degrees of protection against rotavirus infection (Vesikari et al., 2007; Dennehy, 2008; Glass et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, it has been reported that despite wide coverage, the antibodies induced by vaccination cannot totally prevent symptomatic infections of some rotavirus genotypes (Bucardo et al., 2015) . These findings imply that new generation vaccines and complementary preventive approaches are needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with rotavirus diarrhea (Demirjian and Levy, 2009; Glass et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "During the last few years, research has focused on the potential use of probiotics as preventive agents against rotavirus. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) define probiotics as \"live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\" (FAO/WHO, 2001) . These microorganisms are demonstrated to be effective in preventing several disorders such as infections, diarrhea, and inflammatory diseases (Reid, 2008; Kotzampassi and Giamarellos-Bourboulis, 2012) . Moreover, probiotics affect the modulation and establishment of intestinal microbiota and enhance maturation of the innate and adaptive immune systems among others (Kotzampassi and Giamarellos-Bourboulis, 2012) . Regarding the efficacy of these microorganisms in treating rotavirus-related diarrhea, a number of probiotics have been reported including Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains (Lee et al., 2014) and commercial probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus GG (Sindhu et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, most of these reports are based on the amelioration of diarrhea symptoms but little has been published on the identification of the mechanisms and molecules underlying rotavirus inhibition. In this respect, current ideas regarding these mechanisms of action include changes in gut ecology, an effect on the gut mucosal barrier, and a modulation of the immune response (Kotzampassi and Giamarellos-Bourboulis, 2012) , each being strain-specific (Oelschlaeger, 2010) .",

Furthermore, an in vivo effect was shown to involve both antiviral effects and immunological enhancement, providing preliminary protection against the rotavirus infection in a mouse model. The strain was also characterized, demonstrating that B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 fulfills the main criteria required for consideration as a probiotic. However, the interaction of the probiotic with the host cell surface alone did not explain all the mechanisms involved, since infection levels decreased even when the probiotic was added directly to the virus, therefore further studies must be conducted to establish the mechanisms involved in the antiviral effect of this probiotic strain.",

It is assumed that gut microbiota balance, the enhancement of mucosal barrier and the modulation of the immune response afford protection against rotavirus diarrhea (Kotzampassi and Giamarellos-Bourboulis, 2012) . However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of probiotics against rotavirus. A previous work demonstrated the direct effect of strain B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 against rotavirus replication (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011) . Likewise, Lee et al. (2014) found that B. longum (IBG) and L. acidophilus (LA) strongly inhibited rotavirus infection using Vero cell line, but did not identify the mechanism further. In another study, Maragkoudakis et al. (2010) investigated the induction of NO-and H 2 O 2 reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by cell lines co-incubated with lactic acid bacteria, and results were strain and cell line specific. Other data report that probiotics can block viral attachment by competitive inhibition if they are able to bind viral receptors at the surface of intestinal cells (Colb\u00e8re-Garapin et al., 2007) . In our study, a systematic approach was taken to identify the molecules directly involved in rotavirus inhibition. First of all, to determine the nature of the substance of interest, supernatants with and without enzymatic treatment were analyzed for functionality. In these assays, the high percentage of inhibition of the non-treated cell-free supernatants suggested that part of the activity of CECT 7210 strain against rotavirus was not directly exerted by cells, and that the molecule responsible for direct rotavirus inhibition was released to the supernatant, as previously hypothesized for other probiotic strains (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007) . In assays performed to identify the nature of the functional compounds, treatment with different proteases eliminated inhibition capacity, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the substance responsible for inhibiting rotavirus infection. Similar assays were applied with lipases but inhibition capacity was not reduced (data not shown), refuting the potential lipidic nature of the substance of interest.",

            "text": "Once we had confirmed the proteinaceous nature of the substance acting against rotavirus, we went on to identify the active compound. We performed a supernatant purification strategy based on cationic exchange chromatography. This strategy had been carried out successfully to purify a probiotic antibacterial compound . Following this strategy, 28 fractions with cationic nature were obtained. Based on the inhibition of rotavirus infection, only six fractions were positive and thus selected for MALDI-TOF further analysis. Their spectra pointed to one functional compound, the 11amino acid peptide , common in all the positive fractions. This peptide is part of cow milk \u03b2-casein and has a molecular mass of 1.28263 KDa. In order to verify the functionality of the 11-mer peptide, inhibition assays were run with the synthesized peptide in Wa, Ito, and VA70 rotavirus using both HT-29 and MA-104 cell lines. The results were similar to those previously published with the probiotic B. longum CECT 7210 (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011) , reaching a maximum of 56% of infectious foci inhibition, and clearly confirming peptide 11-mer as being responsible for rotavirus inhibition. Reports on the direct activity of peptides against rotavirus are very scarce. Ijaz et al. (1998) found that a synthetic peptide from VP4 directly inhibited rotavirus. Their study hypothesized that VP4-peptide blocks the receptor sites on the host cells. In other studies, Kvistgaard et al. (2004) and Bojsen et al. (2007) found that some bovine macromolecular whey proteins may exert in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against rotavirus, the major component being bovine IgG. Regarding lactoferrin, few peptides have been reported. Superti et al. (1997) used different peptides coming from artificially hydrolyzed lactoferrin to demonstrate that some peptides are able to interfere with different stages in virus replication, and the importance of specific recognition events. Regarding casein as the source of antiviral activity, previous work in bovine milk demonstrated the antiviral activity of \u03ba-casein against human rotavirus and concluded that the inhibitory mechanism of bovine \u03ba-casein against human rotavirus involves direct binding to viral particles via glycan residues (Inagaki et al., 2014) . In our case, the 11-mer peptide does not contain glycan residues, and furthermore, its antiviral activity is conserved with synthesized peptide (with no glycan residues). Therefore, another mechanism must be involved in its activity against rotavirus. The facts that the peptide was effective in assays carried out with both strategies (A and B), and that we found different sensitivities depending on the virus and cell line, strongly suggest a two-way effect, in which the interaction of the peptide with both the mammalian cell surface and directly with the virus, must play a role in the inhibition mechanism, as hypothesized previously (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011) . Moreover, positive results were obtained even at low peptide concentrations (1 \u00b5M), showing the peptide exerts a strong activity.",

            "text": "To identify the source of the 11-mer peptide, the analysis of all the experimental data lead us to hypothesize a secondary origin of the peptide, derived from the preliminary digestion of casein present in the commercial MRS growth medium used. A protease secreted by the probiotic strain B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 may release 11-mer peptide by hydrolyzing the casein present in the culture. A mechanism by which functional molecules are released from casein was previously described by Janer et al. (2005) in B. animalis subsp. lactis species. These authors described a zinc metallopeptidase (PepO) able to hydrolyze \u03b1 s1 -casein (f1-23), which was suggested to play a role in the increased growth of B. animalis subsp. lactis in milk. Accordingly, we performed the purification and identification of the protease responsible for 11-mer production. To obtain the protease, we applied a strategy based on fractionation by anionic chromatography. Following this protocol, a protease-positive anionic extract was obtained, and a SDS-gel band confirmed a unique band. MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting analysis identified the purified protease as \"MalE-type ABC sugar transport system periplasmic component.\" This is a periplasmic binding protein, part of the Maltose ABC sugar transport system, which is involved in the transport of maltose and maltodextrins. Although preliminary studies with this component were performed in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli (reviewed in Ehrmann et al., 1998) , it has been found in other bacteria, including bifidobacteria (Balac_0483 in assembly NC_012814.1 from B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, BLD_1008 in assembly ACD98454.1 from B. longum DJO10A). With the data obtained by the whole genome sequencing of B. longum CECT 7210 strain (Chenoll et al., 2015 ; genome reference LN824140), the protein has been identified in its genome, with a molecular weight of 46.89 KDa, confirming that the protein is produced by this probiotic strain. Once identified, the MalE-type ABC sugar transport system periplasmic component was characterized in terms of its protease activity. The results obtained in inhibition studies with glucose, lactose, and maltose supernatants showed the highest activity when the probiotic was grown in maltose as the only carbon source. Moreover, maltose-grown purified fractions were around 28 times higher, with a maximum of 1000 mU mL \u22121 of activity. These results, together with the quantification of 11-mer peptide when these supernatants and fractions were incubated with \u03b2-casein, confirmed that protease activity is enhanced when maltose is the sole carbon source. This supports the identification of the MalE-type ABC sugar transport system periplasmic component as the molecule responsible for this protease activity. Although protease activity in MalE has not been described previously, our data point to a mechanism whereby the formation of the 11-mer peptide from \u03b2-casein is caused by the direct action of the purified protein, with an efficiency of 28 \u00b1 1 \u00b5g/mL of reaction. Finally, optimum pH and temperature for purified protease activity have been established and the influence of zinc, potassium, and calcium as cofactors on 11-mer production discarded.",
