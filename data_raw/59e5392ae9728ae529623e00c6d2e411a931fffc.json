We aimed to examine the status of having a USC and its patient-related sociodemographic factors among Korean adults. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2012 Korea Health Panel survey. Panel participants were selected for the study who were aged 18 years or older and who replied to questionnaire items on having a USC (n = 11,935). Results: Of the participants, 21.5% had a usual place and 13.9% had a usual physician. Reasons for not having a USC were seldom being ill (66.1%), the preference to visit multiple medical institutions (27.9%), and others. The private community clinic was the most common type of usual place (57.0%). In patient-reported attributes of care provided by a usual physician, the percentages of positive responses for comprehensiveness and coordination were 67.2% and 34.5%, respectively. By institution type, primary care clinics showed the lowest percentage (32.8%) of positive responses for coordination. Adjusted odds ratios of having a usual physician were 3.77 (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.75-3.79) for those aged 65 years or older (vs. aged 18-34 years), 1.31 (CI: 1.30-1.31) for females (vs. males), 0.72 (CI: 0.72-0.73) for unmarried people (vs. married), 1.16 (CI: 1.16-1.16) for college graduates or higher (vs. elementary school graduate or less), 0.64 for the fifth quintile (vs. the first quintile) by household income, 1.53 (CI: 1. 52-1.54) for Medical Aid (vs. employee health insurance) for type of health insurance, and 4.09 (CI: 4.08-4.10) for presence (vs. absence) of a chronic diseases. Conclusions: The proportion of Korean adults who have a USC is extremely low, the most influential factor of having a USC is having a chronic disease or not, and Korean patients experience much poorer health care coordination than do patients in other industrialized countries. The findings of this study will give insight to researchers and policy makers regarding the potential facilitators of and barriers to promoting having a USC in the general Korean public.",

            "text": "The Republic of Korea (Korea) notified the WHO of the first laboratory-confirmed case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on May 20, 2015 ; the patient was someone who had recently travelled to the Middle East. The index patient transmitted infection to close relatives, patients, and health care workers, and subsequently, some of these patients further infected others in a similar pattern. This was the largest outbreak of MERS outside of the Middle East. The large number of health care facilities involved in this event could be explained by the fact that many patients had visited multiple health care facilities before being isolated, and thus these exposures happened before MERS-CoV was suspected or diagnosed. The practice of seeking care at a number of medical facilities (\"doctor shopping\") may have been a contributing factor [1] . Meanwhile, the average number of doctor consultations per person has increased in many OECD countries since 2000. This was particularly the case in Korea, where in 2013 the number of such consultations was the highest (14.6) among the OECD countries compared with the OECD average of 6.5 per person per year [2] .",

People usually do not have a primary care physician as a usual source of medical care (USC) such as general practitioners (GPs) in Western industrialized countries [3] . In many countries (e.g., Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom), GPs address a wide range of patient health problems. When necessary, they refer patients to other health care facilities for further examination or treatment and coordinate the various health care services with outside providers [4] . In Korea, however, people can freely visit medical institutions, see specialists directly on their own, and receive medical treatments by different providers for each episode of care.",

A USC in this study does not indicate a lay person who has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of patients. According to previous studies, having a USC is important for quality of care and efficiency in health care and for health itself. Patients who report having a USC report greater trust and satisfaction with their providers [5] , are more likely to receive preventive screenings and treatment for chronic health conditions, [6] [7] [8] [9] , and report fewer unmet service needs [7] . In addition, having a USC could reduce hospitalization costs [10] , provide more effective and equitable care [11] , increase vaccination coverage [12] , enhance timely access to medical care [13] , improve quality of care received, and result in improved health status [14] . More foundationally, having a usual physician was more important than having a usual place for receipt of certain preventive services such as blood pressure and cholesterol level checks for adults [14] . A combination of usual place and usual provider is a more coordinated approach to providing preventive care, leading to increased access and better health outcomes, whereas having a place for care but no usual provider, or not having a usual place, are both less advantageous [15] . Studies on having a USC have not been performed in countries with formal patient registration associated with capitation systems. Most of the studies were based on self-reported surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the United States, and there is little knowledge regarding the current status and influence of having a USC in Korea.",

This low proportion of having a USC in Korea is related to the weak primary health care system [21] . Korea achieved universal health insurance coverage in 1989 and integrated it into a single insurer, the National Health Insurance Program, with no patient-list system in primary care [22] . Health care providers obligatorily made contracts with the national health insurance corporation [23] , but people can visit any health care provider without referrals from their primary care physicians. Having health insurance is important for having a USC [24] .

People who needed medical care seemed more likely to have a USC than did people who did not need medical care. According to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the United States, 63.0% individuals without a USC answered \"Seldom or never get sick\" as their main reason for not having a USC [25] , which was similar to our results. However, the second-most common reason for not having a USC differed between the two countries: In Korea, it was \"the preference to visit multiple medical institutions\" (27.9%), whereas in the United States, it was the cost of medical care (14%) [25] . The fact that there is a significant portion of people who prefer visiting multiple places (any kind of medical specialists) implies that voluntary participation, rather than mandatory registration, could be an important manner to disseminate having a USC without resistance of the public in Korea. Thirty-eight percent of the people who had a USC considered a community, general, or university hospital to be their usual place of care; these patients were likely to have chronic conditions, and patients with severe conditions need hospital care more than clinic care. Among the medical institutions for which usual physicians worked, the proportion of hospitals was 33.7% in this study. Because hospital ambulatory care can be easily accessed in Korea, a usual hospital physician who can provide multi-morbid patients with coordinated care may be a pragmatic alternative USC from the patients' perspective. In reality, however, care coordination in Korea is very poor, and actual health outcomes according to the types of USC are rarely studied. Previous studies in Western countries found that adults who reported having a primary care physician rather than a specialist as a USC had lower subsequent five-year mortality rates after initial differences in health status, demographic characteristics, health insurance status, health perceptions, reported diagnoses, and smoking status were controlled for [26] . Further research is needed to reveal the preferred type of USCs for improving health outcomes in Korean adults.",
