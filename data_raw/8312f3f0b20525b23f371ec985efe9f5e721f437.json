There are numerous serotypes and variants, which do not confer cross protection resulting in failure of currently used IBV vaccines. Although variant IBV isolates with major genetic differences have been subjected to comparative studies, it is unknown whether minor genetic differences in IBV variants within a serotype are different in terms of pathogenesis and eliciting host responses. Two Massachusetts (Mass) variant IBV isolates recovered from commercial layer flocks in the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK) were compared genetically and evaluated for their pathogenicity, tissue distribution and ability to recruit and replicate in macrophages. Results: Although whole genome sequencing of these two Mass IBV isolates showed low similarity with the M41 vaccinal strain, they had an identical nucleotide sequence at open reading frames (ORFs) 3a, 3b, envelop (E), matrix (M), 5a and 5b. The rest of the ORFs of these 2 IBV isolates showed 99.9% nucleotide similarity. However, upon experimental infection, we found that the IBV isolate originating from AB was different to the one that originated in SK due to higher tracheal lesion scores and lower lung viral replication and lower genome loads in cecal tonsils. Nevertheless, both IBV isolates elicited host responses characterized by significant macrophage recruitment to the respiratory tract and there was evidence that both IBV isolates replicated within tracheal and lung macrophages.",

Traditionally, IBV is considered to be a host-specific respiratory pathogen in chickens and IBV initially replicates at the route of entry, the tracheal mucosa [1, 2] . However, identification of new variants and/ or serotypes of IBV have shown a wide variation of tissue tropism including urinary [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , gastrointestinal [6, 9, 11, 12] , oviduct [9, 13] and bursa of Fabricius [11, 14] . IBV is known to replicate in the reproductive tract epithelium in layers leading to reduced egg production and shell defective eggs [15, 16] . False layer syndrome, which is associated with cystic oviduct formation occurs with IBV infection in early life [17, 18] . IBV can also replicate in the testes of cockerels [19] .",

Genetic events such as insertion(s) and deletions [20, 21] , point mutations [22] , and recombination [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] contribute to genomic variations of IBV [28] . The spike 1 (S1) gene is highly variable among IBV strains and it encodes epitopes, which bind to neutralizing antibodies [29] . A change in the amino acid sequence as small as 2 to 3% in the S1 subunit can result in changes in the antigenicity of the virus [30] . Based on these changes of the S1 protein, numerous IBV strains have been characterized throughout the world [1] . Therefore, either the partial [31] [32] [33] or the full-length [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] of the S1 glycoprotein gene has been used in the molecular characterization of IBV isolates. However, using whole genome sequencing it has been observed that genes other than S1 may play a role in the pathogenicity of IBV infection [40, 41] . Currently, there are no IBV reference full genome sequences available for Canadian IBV isolates but partial [33] or complete [37] S1 sequences are available.",

For example, Mass type IBV variants are impacting the commercial egg production in Western Canada [50] . This study showed that Mass type IBV infection of 27-week old layers at peak production, lead to loss of egg production for about 2 weeks followed by production of shell less, small and defective eggs for another 2 days before the egg production bounced back to normal production. The duration of the loss of marketable eggs appears to be 16 days. In an 8000 bird layer flock of Western Canada, we observed 47.6% drop in egg production for 10 days and we isolated a Mass type variant IBV from this flock. Based on Egg Farmers of Alberta's price of $2.15/dozen of large eggs, the loss for 10 days is calculated to be $6823 for this particular outbreak and the loss will be higher if the infection persists beyond 10 days or reoccur. In addition to this direct loss of egg production, egg grading stations need to outsource supply of eggs during these production drops and also some of the affected birds may succumb to secondary bacterial infections without a recovery, hence the indirect losses are substantially higher than the direct costs of IBV infection.",

From these, a total of 418,446 and 825,147 reads were aligned with the reference IBV genomes. For isolate 15SK-02, a total of 4,355,902 and 3,731,578 reads were obtained from the direct allantoic fluid sample and layered virus sample, respectively, of which, a total of 3,146,584 and 3,152,622 reads were aligned with the IBV reference genomes. The number of reads obtained from Illumina MiSeq for 15SK-02 was 10 times higher than for 15AB-01 and the viral genome concentration of the submitted complimentary (c)DNA was also much higher for 15SK-02 than for 15AB-01 (real-time PCR cycle threshold or Ct value difference of 3.54). Entirely based on the NGS output, the complete genomes obtained for the Mass IBV isolates, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 were 27.6 kb in length. As determined by the open reading frames (ORF) predictor, both isolates had similar genome organization with 11 ORFs and they were 5\u2032-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3\u2032 (Table 1) . Between the isolates, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02, there was 99.9% nucleotide similarity. With the M41 vaccine strain, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 shared a genetic similarity of 92.8 and 92.7%, respectively. 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 Mass IBV isolates shared 92.8 and 92.7% nucleotide similarity with the M41 vaccine strain (GQ504725), respectively. Nucleotide similarities between Mass IBV isolates, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 across the ORFs 3a, 3b, E, M, 5a and 5b were 100%. The remainder of genes were over 99% identical (Table 2) . Nucleotide similarities between Mass IBV isolates, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 across the hypervariable S gene regions, S1 and S2, respectively were 99.6 and 99.8%. The lowest nucleotide similarity these two isolates shared with the vaccine M41 strain was 86.4% in the ORF 5a and the highest similarity was 100% in the ORF M. The S1 and S2 identities of these two IBV isolates with the M41 vaccine strain were 95.5 and 97.6%, respectively (Table 2) . Additionally, our IBV isolates, 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 were compared with important reference strains in Mass type cluster (Table 3) and they are most variable from the Beaudette IBV strain and very closely related to other Mass type IBV strains. Full genome nucleotide distance matrix and heat maps of these isolates with 23 selected reference sequences are shown in the Fig. 1 . The highest similarity of 15AB-01 and 15SK-02 shared with M41 strain (USA) was 99.9%. The lowest similarity was 87.5% with the United Kingdom (UK) strain 1148 (Fig. 1) . Phylogenetic reconstruction with reference IBV strains based on the full genome sequence revealed a close relation with two IBV isolates to the USA Mass type virus (Fig. 2) . The isolate 15AB-01 appeared to be more recently evolved than the 15SK-02 isolate. However, clear separation of these two IBV isolates (cluster M1) from the vaccine M41 strain (Cluster M11) is evident (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "The work described in this manuscript focused, first, to see the genetic differences of two Mass variant IBV isolates originating from layer flocks in two provinces of Western Canada. Second, we evaluated if infection of SPF chicken with genetically different Mass IBV variants would result in a different pathogenicity, tissue distribution and macrophage responses in the respiratory tract. Since the S1 protein is the main inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies [52] [53] [54] , either partial [31] [32] [33] or full-length [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] S1 glycoprotein gene have been used in many studies involving IBV molecular characterization throughout the world including previous Canadian studies. Using whole genome sequencing it has been shown that genes other than S1 may be playing roles in the pathogenicity of IBV [41, 55] . To our knowledge this is the first study, which investigated the full genome of Canadian IBV isolates. Although, IBV strains circulating in other countries have been characterized and changes in the IBV genome due to mutations and recombination have been shown [40, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] , our whole genome sequencing data shows that mutations are more common than the recombination and genes other than S1 have been affected by mutations. These changes in the genome of these two IBV isolates reflected in the differences in the pathogenicity although host response characterized by macrophage recruitment into the respiratory tract were similar. Previously, studies have been conducted to compare pathogenicity and immune responses between nephropathogenic (i.e. QX like IBV strains) and Mass type IBV isolates recovered from various geographical areas [18, 42, 43, 45, 46] . Nephropathogenic QX-type strains are distantly related to the M41 strain and their genetic similarity is 78.6% [60] . Based on the partial S1 sequence analysis of three nephropathogenic IBV isolates, which belong to the Mass genotype revealed that they are more than 99.1 and 97.8% identical to the classical M41 strain in nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, respectively [61] . Since it is well known that very minor changes in the genome of viruses [47] including IBV [49, 62] lead to differences in pathogenicity and host responses, we chose two Mass type IBV isolates expected to have minor genome differences for evaluation of pathogenicity, tissue distribution and host responses. Mass type IBV isolates have been shown to replicate in the respiratory tissues, kidney, cecal tonsils and gastrointestinal tissues [18, 42, 43] . In agreement with these studies, we also observed that Mass IBV isolates originating from Western Canadian layer flocks replicate in tissues other than respiratory tissues. In our study, Mass IBV isolate originating in SK had significantly higher genome load in the lungs than the one originating in AB, though there was no difference of lung lesion score between these two IBV isolates. On the other hand, in trachea, the genome loads of these two Mass IBV isolates were not different, although the Mass IBV isolate originated in AB had significantly higher lesion scores. It is also noteworthy that Mass IBV isolate originating in SK was not detectable at 12 dpi in cloacal swabs. Since the major source of IBV genome in cloaca is due to IBV replication in gastrointestinal tract [63] , it is possible that 15SK-02 IBV infection in gastrointestinal tract may have been cleared by 12 dpi. Overall, these two Mass IBV variants have similar pathogenicity with only slight differences which also agree with the minor genetic differences of these 2 Mass type IBV isolates.",

            "text": "Literature that describe pathogenicity using Canadian IBV isolates are scarce [8] Although this study evaluated the pathogenicity of 5 IBV isolates originated in Ontario poultry flocks, IBV shedding, tissue distribution and macrophage response have not been studied. Molecular characterization of IBV strains circulating in Canada has been done previously and it appears that there is a difference in distribution of IBV genotypes according to the geographic area within Canada [33, 37, 50, 51] . In Western Canada, mostly Mass and Conn IBV genotypes are common and in Eastern Canada, in addition to Mass and Conn genotypes nepharopathogenic strains, 4/91, CA1737 and DMV genotypes are common among poultry flocks. It appears that host responses, characterized by respiratory macrophages following IBV infection is dependent on the IBV strain. For example, it has been shown that M41 but not Australian T strain increases macrophages in respiratory tract lavage [64] . Previously, it has also been shown that IBV ConnA5968 strain elicit higher macrophage response in tracheal mucosa when compared IBV M41 strain [65] . Although Mass IBV (M41) strain is known to increase macrophage responses in lungs and trachea [65] , it is unknown whether variants of Mass IBV are capable of eliciting differential macrophage response in the respiratory mucosa. The current study shows that minor genetic differences in Mass IBV variants do not lead to differences in macrophage responses in the respiratory tract although each of the tested IBV isolates were able to elicit significant macrophage responses in these tissues. IBV M41 and ConnA5968 strains have been shown to replicate in macrophages in vivo and in vitro [65] [66] [67] . The IBV Beaudette strain is able to infect the HD11 macrophage cell line [68] . Although we did not observe a difference in macrophage infection in vivo by both Mass variant IBV isolates used in our experiments, it will be important to establish if these field IBV strains also target macrophages located in the respiratory tract for its replication. We observed a higher quantity of IBV antigens in 15SK-02 IBV infected lungs when compared to 15AB-01 infected lungs and that difference was not reflected in the number of IBV infected macrophages. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that IBV infects cells other than macrophages. Previously, we observed that IBV infection in macrophage of the respiratory tract was about 3-4% [65] .",

However, in a separate study, we investigated the M41 IBV induced macrophage recruitment to respiratory tract [65] . Second, for the quantification of IBV, we employed real-time PCR technique targeting the most conserved N gene of IBV [69] [70] [71] . Since qPCR quantify both live and dead virus [72] , our IBV genome load data do not reflect IBV replication. Alternatively, we would have determined viral titers using 9-11 day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and expressed as EID 50 [73] . Although this later method could be employed to determine IBV infectivity in our swabs and tissues, the use of this technique was precluded for quantifying IBV titer due to the requirement of large numbre of eggs.",
