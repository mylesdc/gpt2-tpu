As we report here, we observed a rapid loss of dendritic cells around B-cell follicles and in the T-cell zone following infection with H5N1 HPAI virus; this effect might reflect a fundamental defect in eliciting efficient adaptive immune responses with high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against H5N1 HPAI virus. This mechanism may explain why both mice and cynomolgus macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus showed more severe symptoms than did animals infected with the same viral titer of H1N1 pdm virus. We also showed, using mouse and non-human primate animal models, that a single immunization with a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus carrying an H5 hemagglutinin (HA)-encoding gene (rVV-H5 HA) was sufficient to prevent severe histological outcomes in animal lungs. In animals vaccinated with rVV-H5 HA, dendritic cells were recruited around B-cell follicles and T-cell zones. Taken together, our results suggest that H5N1 HPAI virus causes severe infection due to insufficient acquired immunity, reflecting impaired stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells and insufficient induction of antigen-specific antibodies.",

Our experiments were designed to compare pathogenic processes that occur during H1N1 pdm and H5N1 HPAI viral infection in mice. Na\u00efve BALB/c mice were infected with either H1N1 pdm virus or H5N1 HPAI virus at the same infectious dose (1 \u00d7 10 4 PFU in a volume of 50 \u03bc L per mouse) (Fig. 1) . The H5N1-infected mice exhibited marked decreases in body weight through day 9 (Fig. 1a) , and all of these animals died or were humanely euthanized since symptoms reached a humane endpoint (see Methods) by 10 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus exhibited moderate decreases in body weight before recovering without mortality (Fig. 1a,b) . Pathological analyses demonstrated that the mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus developed severe pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage at 7 dpi and that the symptoms were markedly aggravated at 9 dpi (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, the mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus showed only partial inflammation (Fig. 1c) . The day-9 histopathological scores in the mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were significantly higher than those in the mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus (5.2 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 2.2 \u00b1 0.7 (mean \u00b1 SD), respectively; Fig. 1d ).",

Control macaques were inoculated with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV)-Empty, which did not include any influenza virus gene, and were then infected with H5N1 HPAI virus or H1N1 pdm virus. The body weights of three macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus fell significantly compared with those of three macaques infected with H1N1 pdm virus (Fig. 2a) . Pathologically, the lungs of the macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus exhibited diffuse alveolar damage, including interstitial inflammation and alveolar edema. In contrast, the macaques infected with H1N1 pdm virus exhibited only localized pulmonary inflammation, even though each macaque was infected with the same titer of the respective virus (Fig. 2b ). At 7 dpi, the mean histopathological score of six lung lobes in individual macaques infected with the H5N1 HPAI virus was significantly higher than that in macaques infected with H1N1 pdm virus ( Fig. 2c ; P < 0.0001, H1N1 vs. H5N1). We next measured the NT 50 and HI titers against each virus. In the macaques infected with H1N1 pdm virus, the NT 50 titer exhibited a nominal increase from 5 dpi, reaching 418-974 at 7 dpi (Fig. 2d) . The HI titer also increased from 6 dpi, and HI activity was observed in all (3/3) H1N1 pdm virus-infected macaques at 7 dpi (Fig. 2e) . In contrast, neither NT 50 titer nor HI titer was detected in any (0/3) macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus during the experimental period ( Fig. 2d and e) . These results suggest that the antibody responses against H5N1 HPAI virus infection were severely reduced in both mice and macaques.",

The mean number of heterogeneous peanut agglutinin (PNA)-binding GCs (PNA + GCs) in each section in mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus was similar to that in mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus ( Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The percentages of GC B-cells (B220 + , GL-7 + , Fas + ) in the spleens were also similar between the mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus and those infected with H1N1 pdm virus when assessed at 7 and 9 dpi (Fig. 3b) . However, B-cell follicles in mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus showed a loose and thin outer layer of IgD + cells (Fig. 3c, lower panels) . In marked contrast, B-cell follicles in mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus were visualized as clear PNA + GCs surrounded by a dense layer of IgD + B-cells (Fig. 3c , upper panels). At 7 dpi, the mean number of GCs in each section in the H1N1 pdm virus-infected macaques was nominally higher than that in the H5N1 HPAI virus-infected macaques, although the difference was not statistically significant ( Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). As seen in mice, a loose and thin outer layer of B-cell follicles was observed in the spleens of macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus, but not in the spleens of H1N1 pdm-infected macaques (Fig. 3e) . As the uninfected macaques used in this study were grown under conventional conditions, slight GC formation was observed even in the spleens of uninfected macaques (Fig. 3e) . The staining intensity of splenic IgD + B-cells in macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus was markedly lower than that of splenic IgD + B cells in uninfected control macaques. Taken together, these results implied that infection with H5N1 HPAI virus decreases the maturation of follicular B-cells in the spleen, and suggested that antigen-specific B-cell responses to H5N1 HPAI virus infection may be impaired in mice and cynomolgus macaques.

Nonetheless, BALB/c mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus ( Fig. 3c and e) . Therefore, we compared the localization and percentage of APCs in the spleens of BALB/c mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus to those of mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus. Throughout the infection period, localization of CD11b + macrophages (CD11b + ; white) in the marginal zone of spleens of mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus was similar to that in mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus (Fig. 4a) . The percentage of macrophages (CD11c low , CD11b high , F4/80 + ) in the spleen in the H5N1 HPAI virus-infected group was similar to that in the H1N1 pdm virus-infected group ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). No significant change in the localization of follicular dendritic cells (FDC-M1 + ; red) in GCs (PNA + ; green) or in the percentage of this cell population (FDC-M2 + , ICAM-1 + ) was seen following infection with either of these viruses . 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

At 1 dpi and 3 dpi, the pattern of accumulation of CD11c + dendritic cells following H1N1 pdm virus infection appeared similar to that following H5N1 HPAI virus infection.

The accumulation area of dendritic cells in fluorescence photomicrographs ( Fig. 5a and b) was analyzed by high-resolution microscopy using an Airyscan-enabled LSM800 and 880 confocal microscopes. The acquired z-stack data were reconstituted by Imaris software and visualized as a three-dimensional image. In the spleen of na\u00efve mouse, dendritic cells were located adjacent to T-cells ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ).

Following subsequent H5N1 HPAI virus infection, macaques primed with rVV-H5 HA displayed formation of mature GCs (with an apparent outer layer of IgD + B-cell follicles) in a manner that resembled that seen following H1N1 pdm virus infection (Fig. 6e) . Inoculation with rVV-H5 HA also induced production of a neutralizing antibody titer (NT 50 = 6.7) in one of three macaques when assessed at 2 weeks after immunization. This rVV-H5 HA-induced titer was sustained through the subsequent challenge with H5N1 HPAI virus (Fig. 6a) . Notably, all (3/3) macaques pre-sensitized with rVV-H5 HA showed rapid increases in titers of neutralizing antibodies from 5 dpi to 7 dpi following challenge with H5N1 HPAI virus. This effect was observed even in the macaques in which neutralizing antibodies were not detected before the virus challenge (Fig. 6a) . In contrast, in control macaques immunized with rVV-Empty, no neutralizing antibody was detected following challenge with H5N1 ( Fig. 6a ; data were obtained from the experiments in Fig. 2d ). The effect of pre-sensitization was confirmed in an assay of the HI titers in macaques following H5N1 virus challenge ( Fig. 6b ; data for rVV-Empty were obtained from the experiments in Fig. 2e ). At 7 dpi with H5N1 HPAI virus, lung pathology of pre-sensitized macaques was ameliorated significantly compared with that of the control macaques immunized with rVV-Empty ( Fig. 6c and d; data for rVV-Empty were obtained from the experiments in Fig. 2c) . The macaques inoculated with rVV-H5 HA showed recovery of mature GC formation with an apparent outer layer of IgD + B-cell follicles after H5N1 HPAI infection (Fig. 6e) . Furthermore, accumulation of dendritic cells surrounding the parafollicular area of T-cells during H5N1 HPAI virus infection of mice was restored by prior immunization with rVV-H5 HA (Fig. 6f) . These results suggested that pre-sensitization with H5 HA antigen reduces the severity of symptoms caused by infection with H5N1 HPAI virus, presumably by restoration of tight interactions of dendritic cells with T-cells and induction of antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

Namely, H5N1 HPAI virus-infected mice and macaques exhibited a decreased antibody response to H5N1 HA, reflecting a lack of cell-cell interaction between dendritic cells and T-cells, and consistent with impaired formation of outer layers of B-cell follicles in the secondary lymphoid organs of these animals.

(a,b) virus from the host. The present study emphasizes the significant role of acquired immunity against H5N1 HPAI virus. Notably, mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus died (or had to be humanely sacrificed) at around 10 dpi, a time point at which acquired immunity is more important than innate immunity. Previous reports by Katz et al. 24, 25 and by Kitajima et al. 26 employed dose-response-time modeling (in BALB/c mice and ferrets) to analyze changes in immune responses and mortality rates after H5N1 influenza virus infection. These papers optimized the experimental data set to obtain representative mortality rates at 7 to 10 dpi with 2-3 viral dose levels [log 10 EID 50 ]. In contrast, H1N1 viruses (e.g., PR8) cause mortality in mice within 5 dpi, suggesting the importance of innate immunity in the immunological response to PR8 27 . A difference in immune response against H5N1 HPAI virus (compared to that against H1N1 virus) also has been reported in a macaque model 21, 28 ; that study focused on dysregulation of innate immune responses. Thus, the contribution to pathogenicity of acquired immunity against H5N1 HPAI virus has not been well examined. Notably, high-affinity and neutralizing anti-influenza virus antibodies are generated after B-cell maturation. Our investigation, which compared murine immune responses against H5N1 to those against H1N1, was performed using carefully selected viral titers. Additionally, for our experimental data set, the responses against H1N1 and H5N1 were compared in parallel, that is, at the same number of dpi. We also carefully examined all mice throughout the infection interval before sacrificing the animals for intensive ex vivo pathological and immunological analyses.",

Under those circumstances, apoptosis of dendritic cells might be induced by the virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "Immunization with rVV-H5 HA induced sufficient initial immune responses with tight cell-cell interactions between dendritic cells and T-cells, along with activation of follicular B-cells to form mature GCs. In this context, the rVV-H5 HA virus (which does not encode other components of the H5N1 HPAI virus) has several advantages as a potential H5N1 vaccine. Notably, the rVV-H5 HA virus rapidly provides immunogenicity with a single dose; additionally, rVV-H5 HA enhances the effective interaction of dendritic cells with T-cells following H5N1 HPAI virus infection. Time-course data for viral titer in mouse lungs demonstrated that rVV-H5 immunization could decrease the viral load of H5N1 HPAI virus in the infection sites in the early phase of H5N1 HPAI virus infection ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Considering these results, we hypothesize that immunization with rVV-H5 might alleviate the decrease in dendritic cell-interaction caused by H5N1 HPAI virus infection in mice, resulting in tight cell-cell interaction between dendritic cells and T-cells and subsequent formation of mature GCs. The efficacy of protective immunity mediated by recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the H5N1 HA gene also has been reported using another vaccinia virus strain (MVA). Kreijtz et al. have reported that immunization with a MVA-based H5N1 vaccine can induce cross-reactive antibodies, including cross-clade protection (in mice and macaque monkeys) against heterologous H5N1 influenza virus 39, 40 . In the present study, we not only confirmed impaired formation of B-cell follicles after H5N1 influenza virus infection, but also showed potentiation of the activation of dendritic cell/T-cell interaction (and improved antibody responses) in H5N1-infected animals previously immunized with rVV-H5N1-HA. Our previous studies and those of others have demonstrated the induction of memory T-cell and B-cell responses following vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus [16] [17] [18] [19] . Further studies will be needed to clarify the efficacy of T-cell-mediated responses in the alleviation of H5N1 HPAI virus infection-associated symptoms following vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus. Our results demonstrate that immunization with rVV-H5 is sufficient to enhance protective activity against infection by the H5N1 virus. LC16m8-derived recombinant vaccinia viruses engineered (like rVV-H5 HA) to express genes encoding particular influenza HA proteins may serve as promising vaccine candidates. ",

In preparation for the construction of LC16m8-derived recombinant vaccinia virus (engineered to express the H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein), LC16m8 was propagated on primary rabbit kidney (pRK) cell cultures prepared as follows. Kidneys extirpated from 7-day-old inbred JW rabbits (KITAYAMA LABES Co., Ltd., Nagano, Japan) were fragmented and subjected to overnight digestion with 100 PU/mL dispase (Sanko Jun-yaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The cells were grown in 150-mm dishes in lactalbumin medium with Hanks' salts (LH) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bc g/mL streptomycin. When the cell confluency was approximately 50%, the culture medium was replaced with lactalbumin medium with Eagle's salts (LE) supplemented with 10% NCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bc g/mL streptomycin. These cultures were infected with LC16m8 as indicated in the next section. Germany) . The synthetic DNAs were amplified by PCR using primers that incorporated flanking restriction enzyme sites (Sbf I and Sgf I). The amplicons were double-digested with Sbf I and Sgf I, and then ligated into a similarly double-digested pBMSF7c vector. The resulting construct (pBMSF7c-mCl2.3) harbored the HA-encoding ORF downstream of an ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter 18 . pBMS-F7c-mCl2.3 was linearized with restriction enzymes and transfected into pRK cells (prepared as above) that had been infected with vaccinia virus LC16m8 at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 for 1 h. After 24 h, the virus-cell mixture was harvested by scraping, and frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. Because the HA protein of influenza virus, but not that of vaccinia virus, can aggregate guinea pig erythrocytes, the resulting HA-positive recombinant viruses able to recognize guinea pig erythrocytes were purified 3 times by plaque cloning; the resulting viral stock was designated rVV-H5 HA. Expression of influenza virus HA protein from rVV-H5 HA vaccines was confirmed by western blotting. A control recombinant vaccinia virus, rVV-Empty, was generated by an analogous procedure using transfection and homologous recombination with linearized empty vector pBMSF7c (rather than pBMS-F7c-mCl2.3). The resulting rVV-Empty contained the ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter but not a transgene encoding an influenza HA protein. rVV-Empty was purified as a HA-negative recombinant vaccinia virus by plaque cloning using chicken erythrocytes.",

Macrophages (CD11b + ; white) were observed in the marginal zone around B-cell follicles (B220 + ; green). (b) Follicular dendritic cells (FDC-M1; red) accumulated in the germinal center (PNA; green). (c) Localization of dendritic cells (CD11c + ; green) and B-cells (B220 + ; red) in the spleen of mice infected with either H5N1 HPAI virus or H1N1 pdm virus was analyzed at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi by immunofluorescent staining.

In contrast, the cell-cell interactions of dendritic cells with T-cells were fewer and rougher in the spleens of mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus(Fig. 5b, white arrowheads; Supplementary movie 2). Previous studies showed that the tight interaction of dendritic cells with T-cells plays an important role in the activation of antigen-specific B-cells to produce high-affinity anti-viral antibodies13,14 . Therefore, our results suggest that animals infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were not able to induce high-affinity antibodies against target viruses because of insufficient cell-cell interactions among antigen-presenting cells (such as dendritic cells with T-cells), thus failing to provide sufficient stimuli to na\u00efve B-cells.Pre-sensitization with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing H5 HA protein potentiates efficient humoral immune responses after H5N1 HPAI virus challenge by inducing the accumulation of dendritic cells.To reinforce antibody responses of macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus, macaques were immunized intradermally with a single dose of rVV-H5 HA, a recombinant vaccinia virus (derived from the highly attenuated strain LC16m8)15 that harbors the gene encoding the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) protein (Clade 2.3.4) under control of an ATI/p7.5 synthetic hybrid promoter",
