In 2014, a major Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemic impacted the Caribbean and South America. As part of ongoing screening of schoolchildren presenting with acute undifferentiated febrile illness in rural Haiti, we used RT-PCR to identify CHIKV infections in 82 of 100 children with this diagnosis during May-August 2014. Among these, eight were infected with a second arbovirus: six with Zika virus (ZIKV), one with Dengue virus serotype 2, and one with Mayaro virus (MAYV). These dual infections were only detected following culture of the specimen, suggesting low viral loads of the co-infecting species. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the ZIKV and MAYV strains differ from those detected later in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Moreover, CHIKV and ZIKV strains from co-infected patients clustered monophyletically in their respective phylogeny, and clock calibration traced back the common ancestor of each clade to an overlapping timeframe of introduction of these arboviruses onto the island.",

We identified CHIKV infections in 82 of 100 PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.children presenting with fever during this time-period; six of the children infected with CHIKV were found to be co-infected with Zika virus (ZIKV), one with Dengue virus serotype 2, and one with Mayaro virus.

After first isolation of CHIKV in 1952 in present-day Tanzania, outbreaks and epidemics were limited to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. In 2013, CHIKV emerged for the first time in the Americas, with sustained autochthonous transmission and rapid spread through the region [1] [2] [3] . The acute symptoms of CHIKV infection are similar to those of infection with other arbovirus species, including Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV), each presenting with a constellation of symptoms including fever, headache, and myalgias/arthralgias. Long-term, CHIKV infections have been linked with persistent arthralgias in a subset of cases [3] ; it has also been reported that upwards of 90% of CHIKV-infected individuals are symptomatic, in contrast to findings with ZIKV, where it is estimated that only 20% of infected persons are symptomatic [4, 5] .",

We have previously reported isolation of ZIKV [8] , DENV [9] , Human coronavirus NL63 [10] , and Enterovirus D68 [11] from children in this school cohort; however, the cases/outbreaks in these prior publications did not include CHIKV, or cases within the May-August, 2014, time frame of the current study.

Confluent cell cultures were split into 25cm 2 flasks 24 hours prior to inoculation to attain 60% confluent cell monolayers the following day. Prior to inoculation, the culture medium was removed and inoculum containing 100\u03bcl of plasma that had been filtered through a sterile 0.45 filter and mixed with 400\u03bcL aDMEM with 3% FBS, GlutaMAX, and PSN antibiotics was added to the monolayer. The inoculated monolayer was incubated at 37\u02daC in 5% CO 2, and rocked every 15 minutes for 1 hour. A negative control (mock-infected) cell culture was inoculated with 500ul of DMEM without virus or plasma and handled in parallel with the other cultures. After allowing for virus adsorption for 1 hr, the inocula were removed and replaced with 3ml of aDMEM with 3% FBS, GlutaMAX, and PSN antibiotics, and thereafter incubated at 37\u02daC in 5% CO 2 . Cell cultures were refed every 3 days by the replacement of 1.5ml of spent media with aDMEM with 3% FBS. The cultures were observed for up to 21 days' post-inoculation, or until CHIKV-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in the cell monolayers using an inverted microscope. When CPE were observed throughout 50% of the monolayer, a final collection of 2ml spent media, and 1ml of scraped cells in spent media, were cryopreserved at -80\u02daC for future tests.",

For the sequencing of DENV, primers described by Christenbury et al were utilized [20] . Amplification of each segment was performed using an Accuscript high-fidelity first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) followed by PCR with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The 5' and 3' ends of the viral genomes were obtained using RNA-ligase mediated (RLM) systems for 5' and 3' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Amplicons were purified, sequenced bi-directionally, then the sequences assembled with the use of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI), and subsequently analyzed in comparison to DENV, MAYV, and ZIKV sequences available in GenBank for nucleotide sequence comparisons. The vRNA sequences we obtained differed from those of the corresponding viruses in our repository, confirming the newly analyzed sequences did not arise from laboratory contamination.",

Two demographic priors were also tested for each analysis: constant population size or non-parametric Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP). Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run for 50-200 million generations (sampled at fixed intervals to obtain posterior distributions with 10,000 data points), depending on the data set, in order to assure proper mixing of the MCMC, which was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size (ESS) of each parameter estimate, accepting only ESS values >200. The best clock/demographic model for each virus-specific data set was chosen by comparing marginal likelihood estimates (MLE) [35] , obtained using path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [33, 36] with Bayes Factor (BF) (S2 Table) . In practice, the BF natural logarithm was used for comparison with lnBF<2 indicating no evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e. less parameter-rich model), 2-6-weak evidence, 6-10-strong evidence, and >10 very strong evidence [37] .",

Among the 100 plasma specimens taken from febrile schoolchildren in the May-August time period, 82 tested positive via rtRT-PCR for CHIKV, but were negative for DENV1-4 and ZIKV. Among the 18 specimens from febrile schoolchildren during this time period that were not positive for CHIKV, two gave equivocal results in the rtRT-PCR assay and were excluded from the analysis, two were DENV type 1 positive, and 14 were negative in all assays. Cultures were not performed on these 18 specimens due to insufficient specimen volume, reflecting the large number of assays that had been conducted in the initial screening of what were relatively small blood samples from each child. The mean age of children from whom specimens were collected was 9.6 years. Ninety-two of the 100 specimens were from students at Campus A of the school; 7 were from Campus B, and one was from Campus C.

Typical CHIKV-induced CPE, consisting of cell membrane blebbing, cell lysis, and apoptosis, were observed in cultures from 43 of the 62 samples on average 5 days post inoculation (dpi), with some specimens displaying advanced CPE as early as 2 dpi and others not until 20 dpi (Fig 1) ; target vRNA's were positive by rtRT-PCR for CHIKV but negative for DENV and ZIKV [15] [16] [17] . All negative control cell cultures lacked CPE and tested negative by rtRT-PCR for the target vRNAs of this work. Eleven (15%) of the 62 samples cultured did not display any CPE during the period of culture and tested negative for target vRNAs in these studies, despite initial positive CHIKV results by rtRT-PCR. Eight cultures displayed CPE inconsistent with those expected for CHIKV (Fig 2) . The mixed CPE in these latter cultures was associated with co-infection with CHIKV together with another virus, as determined by molecular tests of the cultured specimens: co-infecting arboviruses included ZIKV (n = 6), DENV type 2 (n = 1), and MAYV virus (n = 1). Sex and age of patients were comparable for those with CHIKV mono-inections and the subset of CHIKV cases with co-infections. Seven of the 8 co-infections were from Campus A of the school; one co-infection (CHIKV and ZIKV) was in a student from Campus B. (Fig 3) using the best fitting molecular clock/demographic model (S2 Table) , were inferred for each data set. Bayesian and ML reconstructions displayed very similar topologies and suggested three independent phylogenetic lineages of CHIKV in Haiti, possibly the result of three separate introductions (Figs 3A and S3A) . The CHIKV strains from the current study were in a well-supported monophyletic clade which was most closely related to a strain from El Salvador (Fig 3A) . Within this clade, six CHIKV strains were from patients co-infected with ZIKV and one with DENV-2. Molecular clock median estimate of the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for the clade was August 2013, with 95% highest posterior density (95%HPD) intervals between April 2013 and January 2014 ( Fig 3A) . As shown in Fig 3, two other 2014 CHIKV isolates, not collected as part of this study but previously reported by Lanciotti (KR559476 and KR559478) from mono-infected Haitian patients, clustered within a second distinct clade related to different Central and South American strains, but separate from our Gressier strains. One of the 10 sequenced CHIKV strains from our cohort, from a randomly selected mono-infection in a child from Campus B, was in yet a third clade, which clustered most closely with a strain from the Dominican Republic.",

As a starting point in unraveling these dynamics, we were interested in better quantifying the frequency of such infections, and exploring possible origins of co-infecting strains. To optimize our ability to identify co-infections (and following standard practices in our laboratory [8, 17, 19, 39] ), we continued diagnostic studies even after initial identification of CHIKV or another pathogen in a patient sample. Interestingly, while we identified multiple co-infecting viruses in cell culture, the original patient rtRT-PCR in this study was, in each instance, negative for the second pathogen, suggesting that viral loads for the co-infecting species were low. We also had instances where viral cultures were negative in the setting of a positive rtRT-PCR, possibly reflecting the presence of non-viable virus in the sample, and/or strains that have mutated or which do not grow well in Vero cells. If we are to better understand the role of co-infections in disease occurrence, the diagnostic significance of both rtRT-PCR negative/culture positive and rtRT-PCR positive/culture negative samples will require further study.",

Another study from the Colombian-Venezuelan border reports a CHIKV/DENV co-infection prevalence of 7.6% [43] . In our study, in contrast, the co-infection rate was only 1%, with only two additional dengue cases (both DENV-1) identified among CHIKV-negative patients; this may reflect a low level of circulating DENV in the community during the CHIKV epidemic, and/or a high existing level of population immunity to the virus. We also identified one CHIKV/MAYV co-infection. We have previously reported a mixed MAYV and DENV-1 infection that occurred outside of the time frame of the CHIKV epidemic (January, 2015) in the same school cohort [18] . The high genomic similarity of this Haitian MAYV isolate with a Brazilian strain isolated in 1960 corroborates our hypothesis that MAYV has been criptically circulating in the human population at a sub-epidemic level, most likely in Brazil, for years and that it was introduced just recently onto Hispaniola [24] .",

            "text": "What was unexpected in our data set was the relatively high frequency of ZIKV/CHIKV coinfections. This occurred in a setting in which we were only screening plasma samples. As we have previously reported [39] , urine can be positive for ZIKV for a longer period of time than plasma; if we had also screened urine, there is the possibility that we would have identified additional ZIKV-positive patients. We, and others, have previously reported cases of ZIKV/ CHIKV co-infection [19, 42, 44, 45] , so finding the two together is not surprising. The ZIKV case cluster in the current study would appear to have been relatively widespread within the community (i.e., not a point source at the school), as one of the six co-infections was from a child at a different school campus, ca. 5 miles from the main campus. Interestingly, our molecular clock analysis indicates that the strains of CHIKV and ZIKV found in our patients were both introduced in Haiti within the same short time frame, each one giving rise to a well-supported monophyletic clade, one including all CHIKVs from CHIKV/ZIKV co-infected subjects, the other one including all ZIKVs from the same co-infected subjects. The simultaneous emergence of these two clades in the Haitian population is compatible with a simultaneous coinfection scenario or indicate, at the very least, the sequential infection of a patient with two arboviruses within a relatively short period of time. In light of recent reports that mosquito coinfection with ZIKV and CHIKV allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence [46] , it is plausible that the two viruses were co-transmitted by the same mosquito. Given that these are among the earliest, if not the earliest, documented ZIKV infections in the hemisphere, the observation that they appeared together with epidemic CHIKV raises interesting questions about the possible role of CHIKV in the initiation of the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas.",

Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with the idea that there were multiple introductions of CHIKV into Haiti between 2013 and 2014, with identification of three distinct phylogenetic lineages, each clustering with strains from different parts of the Caribbean and/or South America. This was also the case for ZIKV: the ZIKV co-infecting strains did not cluster with the ZIKV strains previously obtained in Haiti in 2014 and 2016, consistent with multiple introductions or re-introductions of this arbovirus in Haiti between 2014 and 2016. Although for DENV-2 and MAYV the data are more limited, the tMRCAs for DENV-2 suggested that the introduction in Haiti happened between 2008 and 2014, a time interval again overlapping with the estimated introduction of both CHIKV and ZIKV co-infecting strains circulating in Haiti. Clustering of both the ZIKV and DENV-2 strains together with ZIKV and DENV-2 strains obtained in Florida in 2016 [38, 47] , as well as the multiple independent introductions of CHIKV, ZIKV, and MAYV to Haiti inferred from the phylogenies, demonstrate the potential role of the Caribbean as a node for arbovirus infections connecting South, Central, and North America.
