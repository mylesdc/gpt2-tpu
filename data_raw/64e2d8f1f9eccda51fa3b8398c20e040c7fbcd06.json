No vaccines or drugs are clinical available to control EV71 epidemics. In present study, we show that treatment with lycorine reduced the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) on rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by inhibiting virus replication. Analysis of this inhibitory effect of lycorine on viral proteins synthesis suggests that lycorine blocks the elongation of the viral polyprotein during translation. Lycorine treatment of mice challenged with a lethal dose of EV71 resulted in reduction of mortality, clinical scores and pathological changes in the muscles of mice, which were achieved through inhibition of viral replication. When mice were infected with a moderate dose of EV71, lycorine treatment was able to protect them from paralysis. Lycorine may be a potential drug candidate for the clinical treatment of EV71-infected patients.",

However, there have debates on which step of protein synthesis is blocked by lycorine. Jimenez et al. has indicated that lycorine halts protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by blocking the peptide bond formation [31] . Lycorine was shown to prevent the coupling of the N-acetyl leucyl residue from UACCAacetyl leucine to puromycin, and it was therefore postulated that these compounds inhibited the transpeptidation reaction [32] . In contrast, it has been reported that lycorine affects the termination but not the elongation nor the cleavage of the polyprotein [33] . The single large coding region of the EV71 genome is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (5' and 3' UTR). The coding region is translated as a single polyprotein, which is then processed by viral proteases to yield mature viral proteins including the capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D) [34] . We investigated the inhibitory mechanism of lycorine on EV71 replication by detecting the step of the viral life cycle that was initially blocked post drug treatment and found that the repression effect of lycorine on the synthesis of viral proteins located at C terminal of the polyprotein was earlier and more substantial than its effect on viral proteins located at N terminal of polyprotein ( Figure 3) ; therefore, we concluded that the drug inhibits the elongation of the viral polyprotein during protein synthesis. The imbalanced synthesis of viral proteins could interrupt the package of the virus. And the inhibition of 3D protein could result in the reduction of replication of virus, as the 3D protein is the RNA polymerase of EV71 [35] .",

Empirical data from previous reports suggests that lycorine may be responsible for symptoms such as nausea and emesis [22] . High concentration of lycorine-induced apoptosis of RD cells was observed in this study (Figure 2 ), which indicated that lycorine is noxious to eukaryotic cells. However, lycorine could inhibit the replication of EV71 at very low concentration and the IC 50 for inhibiting EV71 infection was approximately 100-fold lower than the CC 50 on RD cell, suggesting that it had potential application in the clinical treatment of EV71 infection. This assumption was verified by evaluating the antiviral effect of lycorine in a mouse model, as the survival rate of 0.4 mg/kg lycorine-treated mice was significantly enhanced compared to the control mice upon lethal EV71 infection ( Figure 4A) , and the alleviation of acute symptoms and reduction of pathological changes in the muscles of lycorine-treated mice were achieved by inhibiting the replication of virus (Figure 4, 5, 6 ). The surviving mice in the lycorine treated group recovered within 14 days. Furthermore, lycorine treatment did not cause Figure 5 Lycorine inhibited the replication of EV71 in muscle tissues of mice. The infected-mice were treated with placebo or lycorine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. The muscle tissues were sampled at 1 dpi, 3 dpi, 5 dpi and 9 dpi respectively (n = 8). A, the viral replication curve were determine by qRT-PCR (*: p < 0.05). B, the viral burden was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.",

In previous studies, treatment with several drug candidates, including ribavirin, bovine lactoferrin, siRNA and type I interferon, were able to enhance the survival rates of infected mice to 18%-100% [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, because the infection doses of virus and strains were different in these experiments, it is difficult to compare the activity of these drugs, but we observed that the efficiency of lycorine against EV71 infection was better than ribavirin, as shown in IC 50 determination ( Figure  1A ) and evaluation by a mouse model ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, as most of the EV71 infections were selflimited and did not cause severe complications in patients, self-resolved EV71 infection model, in which the infected mice develop paralysis at 5 dpi and the symptoms were basically self-limited within 8 dpi. As we expected, lycorine treatment was able to protect the infected-mice from paralysis symptoms by inhibiting EV71 replication (Figure 7) . Meanwhile, we found that lycorine could also inhibit the infectivity of three other EV71 strains (these strains were isolated from clinical specimens from different regions of mainland China and belong to the C4 genotype) on RD cells (data not shown); which demonstrates that lycorine has an effective antiviral spectrum against EV71 strains prevalent in mainland China. Figure 6 Lycorine reduced the virus distribution and the pathological damages. The infected mice were treated with placebo or lycorine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. The muscle tissues were sampled at 1 dpi, 3 dpi, 5 dpi and 9 dpi for pathological analysis. A, the virus distribution was detected by immunohistological staining. B, the pathological changes were observed after H&E staining. The red arrows indicated virions in tissues, the green arrows for moderate inflammation and the blue for necrotising myositis.

A, the Viral RNA copies in RD cells were determined by qRT-PCR in a 0.5 hour intervals for 1.5 hours of treatment and the early stage of lycorine inhibition for virus was detected (*: p < 0.05); B, in the early stage of virus inhibition (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 hours of lycorine treatment), the amounts of viral proteins in infected RD cells was detected by western blotting with the specific primary antibodies against different viral proteins. C, the intensity of bands of viral proteins in control cells were defined as 100, and the intensity of bands of viral proteins in lycorine-treated cells were compared respectively with those of saline-treated cells at 1 hour of treatment.
