Smith belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family which comprises approximately 14 genera and 1700 species throughout the world, and is widely spread in tropical and subtropical regions. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005 edition) listed Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith as an official drug, which showed that the plant could be used as anticancer herbs [1] . In the past, people used the rhizomes and extracts from the plant as vermifuges [2] . The plant can be used to cure many diseases, such as influenza, acute and chronic pharyngitis, cancer, and migraine [3] . In addition, the herb was used as antiviral agents to cure severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening viral respiratory illness believed to be caused by a coronavirus [4] . Furthermore, phoroglucinols and flavonoids are known to display a wide array of pharmacological and biochemical actions, and have been isolated from many species of the Dryopteridaceae family [5] . However, so far the constituents with anticancer activity of the plant remain unclear. Thus it is necessary to identify the potent antitumor compounds from this plant.",

The combined EtOH extracts were evaporated to dryness to yield a dried EtOH extract (424 g). The extract was suspended in water and then extracted with petroleum ether (10 L \u00d7 3 times), ethyl acetate (10 L \u00d7 3 times), and n-BuOH (10 L \u00d7 3 times), respectively. Different extracts solvent were then concentrated using evaporator under vacuum at 50\u00b0C to afford the petroleum ether extract (46 g), ethyl acetate extract (95 g), and n-BuOH extract (110 g). MTT assay was used to evaluate their antitumor activities. The results suggested that the antitumor agents were mainly contained in ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts. Further experiments were performed on ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts to separate antitumor compounds. The ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts were subjected to column chromatography (CC) to yield 16 fractions. An activity-directed isolation process was used to get compounds, and 23 compounds were obtained from these fractions.",

The inhibitory percentage of cells was treated with 20 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcg/mL of each compound or extract for 72 h ( Table 1 ). The results showed that the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts had great antitumor activity, and PPI had good activities against the three human cancer cell lines tested than other compounds. The inhibitory ratios of PPI at 72 h after treatment were 67.1% on MGC-803 cells, 57.2% on PC3 cells, 45.8% on A375 cells, and 24.8% on NIH3T3 cells. It could be seen that PPI had good antitumor activities and low cytotoxic effect on normal cell line NIH3T3. Further experiments found that proliferation of these three carcinoma cells were significantly inhibited by PPI in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in Figure 1 . The IC 50 values of PPI against MGC-803, PC3, and A375 cells were determined to be 14.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, 20.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, and 29.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively, which were lower than that on NIH3T3 cells (IC 50 > 100 \u03bcM).",

PPI showed potent activities on MGC-803, PC3, and A375 cell lines, with the IC 50 values of 14.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, 20.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, and 29.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively. The apoptosis inducing activities of PPI on MGC-803 cell lines were investigated through AO/EB staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL and FCM assay.
