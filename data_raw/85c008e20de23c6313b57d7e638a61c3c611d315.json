            "text": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by hypersensitivity and inflammation of the airways with clinical symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, coughing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, shortening of breath, chronic eosinophilic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and tightening of the chest [1, 2] . The exacerbation of asthma symptoms and the level of asthma severity have shown to be related to genetic susceptibilities to exposure to various environmental triggers [3] . Inflammatory triggers of asthma include pets, dander, dust, mold, pollen, and viral respiratory infections and non-inflammatory triggers include tobacco smoke, exercise, weather changes, stress, and air pollution [4, 5] . The contribution of viral infections to the occurrence of asthma exacerbations has been of broad interest for the past 20 years [6] . In this regard, it is believed that viral respiratory tract infections with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinoviruses are the major causes of acute asthma exacerbations in children [7] [8] [9] [10] . Besides, the involvement of coronaviruses (hCoV) in asthma exacerbation has been recently revealed with the implementation of molecular methods. coronaviruses are enveloped, with a single stranded RNA, linear, non segmented and positive sense genome. These viruses are divided into 3 distinct genera (genus Alpha, Beta and Gamma coronavirus). So far, five types of human coronaviruses including HCoV-OC43 (mid-1960s), HCoV-229E (mid-1960s), SARS-CoV (2003), HCoV-NL63 (2004) and HCoV-HKU1 (2005), have been described [11] . The involvement of coronaviruses in asthma exacerbation has recently been revealed with the implementation of molecular methods such as the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [12] . Here, we report the first case of an asthma exacerbation triggered by acute pharyngitis event in a child caused by HCoV-HKU-1 infection.",

Prior to the hospitalisation, she was given one dose of Salbutamol nebulizer in a private clinic for her respiratory problem. Her symptoms partially relieved. She had been diagnosed with bronchial asthma at the age of 18 months when she first presented with 2 episodes of wheezing and breathing difficulty following an upper respiratory infection which had responded well to the bronchodilator nebulization. Subsequent to the above episode, she continued to have intermittent symptoms such as nocturnal cough and occasional wheeze 2-3 times per week. However, she had not been given any prophylactic medications for asthma. The symptoms were triggered by changes in temperature, dust, common cold and cigarette smoke. Her father is a chronic smoker. There was no history of allergy but she has strong family history of asthma. There was no history of exercise-induced cough or wheeze. On admission, she was afebrile but tachypneic with respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute with intercostal and subcostal recession. There was an audible wheeze. Her vital signs except the increased respiratory rate were within normal limits. There was no skin eczema. The patient's throat was inflamed without tonsillar enlargement. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflation. No pneumonic changes were observed and cardiac size was normal. Generalized rhonchi on lungs auscultation could be heard.",

Tamiflu syrup was also prescribed for her flu-like symptoms. An asthma education was provided to the parents. She was hospitalized for 5 days.

This strain was first detected by Woo et al (2005) in Hong Kong [20] . In a study on the prevalence of recently identified viruses in children with acute wheezing, HCoV-HKU1 was not detected [21] . Kuypers et al., (2007) showed that HUK1 was the most common subtype of coronaviruses found in children [22] . In a prospective longitudal cohort study of young children, NL63 and OC43 strains were shown to be associated with a burden of LRTI. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma were the most important diagnosis in these patients [23] . It has also been reported that all four strains of coronaviruses are associated with both URI and LRI in children and also OC43 and NL63 strains are responsible for the most cases of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma exacerbation in these patients [24] . In this report for the first time we detected HCoV HKU1 in a child with asthma exacerbation triggered by acute pharyngitis. However, more detailed microbiological investigations especially molecular techniques are required to confirm the relationship between HCoV HKU1 infection and asthma attack. Our findings suggest the necessity of considering HCoV HKU1 as a potential cause or precursor of asthma exacerbation in children.",
