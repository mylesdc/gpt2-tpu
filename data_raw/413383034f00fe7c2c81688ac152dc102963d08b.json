In this context, ciprofloxacin is part of the first-line of countermeasures against numerous high consequence bacteria. Significant resistance can occur via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and deletions within ciprofloxacin targeted genes. Ideally, use of ciprofloxacin would be prefaced with AR determination to avoid overuse or misuse of the antibiotic. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of a panel of 44 single-stranded molecular inversion probes (MIPs) coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of genetic variants known to confer ciprofloxacin resistance in Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. Sequencing results demonstrate MIPs capture and amplify targeted regions of interest at significant levels of coverage. Depending on the genetic variant, limits of detection (LOD) for high-throughput pooled sequencing ranged from approximately 300-1800 input genome copies. LODs increased 10-fold in the presence of contaminating human genome DNA. In addition, we show that MIPs can be used as an enrichment step with high resolution melt (HRM) real-time PCR which is a sensitive assay with a rapid time-to-answer. Overall, this technology is a multiplexable upfront enrichment applicable with multiple downstream molecular assays for the detection of targeted genetic regions.",

These measures would help to stop transmission as well as evolution of future multidrug-resistant strains through better antibiotic stewardship.

Ciprofloxacin targets the bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV 3 by covalent linkage to conserved sites on these enzymes, termed quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDR), resulting in permanent double stranded breaks and cell death. While highly effective against susceptible bacteria, high levels of drug resistance are readily acquired through genetic variants in the targeted genes 2, 4 . In addition, fluoroquinolone resistance can also result from a decrease in drug accumulation through porin loss and overexpression of efflux pumps 3, 5 . The high consequence pathogens Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis are not naturally resistant to ciprofloxacin; however, serial passage of these organisms in the presence of ciprofloxacin quickly results in mutations in the QRDR, conferring high-level resistance 4, [6] [7] [8] .",

Previous studies using techniques such as padlock and molecular inversion probes (MIP) as upfront enrichment steps for use with NGS showed the specificity and multiplexability of these techniques [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In this context, \"gap-fill\" molecular inversion probes, when combined with NGS, allow for the capture and evaluation of substantially more genetic information [18] [19] [20] [21] . Specifically, after gap filling and probe circularization by a polymerase and ligase, the capture sequence can be amplified with the universal primer pair and prepared for NGS (Fig. 1) . Recently, evaluation of the MIP platform for strain typing extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli correlated well with the current diagnostic standard amplified fragment length polymorphism technique 21 . Similarly, studies showed MIPs are capable of detecting and distinguishing filovirus species for broad pathogen screening and biosurveillance 20 . Here, we characterized the use of MIPs as an upfront enrichment step for the detection of genetic variants conferring ciprofloxacin resistance in high consequence pathogens B. anthracis, Y. pestis, and F. tularensis using NGS and high resolution melt (HRM) real-time PCR as downstream molecular detection technologies.",

Sequencing reads which mapped to the six targeted QRDR reference genes plotted against total number of genome copies, calculated from DNA input concentrations, demonstrated a sigmoidal dose-response with a linear range beginning around 1000 genome copies for each gene mapped (Fig. 3) . Often in pooled NGS runs dual-indexed sequencing reads will be misidentified during demultiplexing resulting in incorrect read mappings between samples known as sample bleeding 22, 23 . To account for misidentified reads, non-template controls were used to define a background and are termed throughout the paper as the \"cutoff \". The cutoff was determined as the average number of sequencing reads mapped to the reference gene in the non-template controls plus three times the standard deviation. Pearson coefficients demonstrated high degrees of correlation between target regions suggesting similar capture efficiencies (Supplementary Table S2 ). Total mapped reads composition, shown as a percentage of all mapped reads for each reference gene, indicated that decreases in total input DNA resulted in decreased correctly mapped reads (Fig. 3) . Above the cutoff of the assay 80% or more of the sequencing reads mapped correctly. Most of the sequencing reads at or below the cutoff remained unmapped for the reference targets (Supplementary Figure S1) . Indeed, at the cutoff, the low percentage (3%) of the total sequencing reads mapped to reference genes gradually increased to more than 90% of total reads at higher input concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1) . Analytical limit of detection (LOD); performance and confirmation. Capture of target genes demonstrated a preliminary cutoff for mapped reads above background levels in wild type cultures; however, the intended application of these probes was to detect ciprofloxacin resistance mutations. To test sequence coverage of the targeted genetic variants, we assessed strains with mutations known to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin 4 . Because WGA may incorporate bias 22 , these experiments used non-amplified whole genome extracted DNA to more accurately determine the assay LOD. Linear regression was utilized to fit data to a line and determine the point at which each genetic variant had 30X read coverage above the cutoff as determined by non-template controls 24 (Fig. 4) . This crossing point was determined to be the assay LOD. An LOD range was given for each genetic variant based on the standard error of the linear regression. In this context, each genetic variant fell within ranges of detection between 300 and 1200 input genome copies similar to the cutoff levels determined earlier. As demonstrated previously, the percentage of correctly assigned reads was between 80-100% at concentrations near or above the LOD (Fig. 4) .",

Sequencing data showed targeted amplification coupled to NGS was functional for determining ciprofloxacin resistance conferring genetic variants; however, this NGS strategy sacrifices cost, time-to-answer, and sensitivity for the benefit of a high degree of target multiplexability. In cases of limited sample volume and a large number of potential targets, real-time PCR or HRM real-time PCR screening is not feasible. A multiplexed upfront amplification strategy could be used to amplify targets of interest allowing for screening with these low cost, quick time-to-answer singleplex assays. To test MIPs applicability as a target amplification technique for other molecular assays, we assessed HRM assays targeting ciprofloxacin resistant genetic variants with amplicons generated by the MIP protocol. Detection of two gyrA mutations and a parE deletion in F. tularensis 4 using the MIP protocol as an upfront target enrichment demonstrated differences between wild-type and ciprofloxacin resistant strains (Fig. 7a,b) . Melting peaks with the gyrA C248T G259T mutation had an overall decrease in melting temperature, and the parE \u0394 TTAAA mutation had an increase in melting temp due to the increase in GC content. Furthermore, the use of MIPs significantly amplified target sequences based on Cq values for HRM experiments performed with purified genomic DNA versus amplified MIP DNA (Fig. 7c,d) . Specifically, MIPs significantly reduced detection above background for the HRM analysis even after a 1:10,000 dilution of the MIP amplified material was required for the assays to fall within the optimal Cq range (Fig. 6c,d) . Overall, cumulative datasets with these MIPs suggest this technique is a highly multiplexable capture system that can be utilized with multiple molecular detection assays for genetic variant identification. Discussion Bacterial organisms frequently evolved innate immunity to antibiotics for survival in environmentally competitive niches 25 . Recently however ecological studies have shown development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens caused by increased antibiotic usage in animals, food, and humans 26 . A continuous cycle of newly acquired resistances results from the acquisition of genetic material or genetic variations in an organism's genome. Currently, standard AR susceptibility testing is a laborious and lengthy process requiring pure bacterial cultures isolated from patient samples grown in the presence of antibiotics 27 . While susceptibility testing will likely remain Real-time PCR is currently the standard molecular diagnostic for pathogen detection and more recently has been used for AR profiling 29, 30 although NGS is quickly being adopted in clinical laboratories. Real-time PCR is advantageous to other molecular diagnostics in many aspects including cost, time to answer, and sensitivity. One major aspect for time to answer is assay sensitivity and the ability to detect pathogen directly from patient samples without the necessity of culture. Bacteremia in septic patients can range more than 10-fold although < 1000 colony forming units/ml of blood is common 31, 32 . Real-time PCR offers sensitivities approaching one target copy per reaction 28, 29, 33 allowing sample processing and detection directly from patient samples. NGS capabilities have outpaced Moore's law boasting continuous technical improvements over the past decade however, relative to real-time PCR, diagnostic sensitivities are still lacking 9 . Metagenomic sequencing from clinical samples requires ultra-deep sequencing to obtain desired coverage levels of targeted pathogen and is not practical for routine clinical use due to cost and informatics burden. Targeted sequencing helps to bridge the gap between the sensitivities seen with real-time PCR and the quantitative data associated with NGS.",

Other factors affecting LOD include poor signal to noise and misidentification of pooled samples. Specifically, excess MIP backbone within each sample resulted in higher noise at low sample input concentrations (Supplemental Figure S1 ). De novo assembly of the un-mapped reads showed residual MIP backbone present after the cleanup. This was due to the formation of concatemers during the amplification process. The resulting background was more problematic as input concentrations approached the background cutoff. Similarly, incorrect assignment of dual indexed samples or sample bleeding 22, 23 was more pronounced at lower input concentrations.

Metagenomic sequencing could both classify the organism along with known resistance markers; however, the expertise and computing infrastructure required for analyzing data is still burdensome for clinical and biosurveillance programs. Metagenomic sequencing is not conducive for pooled sample NGS runs due to the difficulty obtaining adequate sequence coverage for genetic variants in complex matrices, increasing per sample costs.

Targeted sequencing allows for significant coverage of desired regions over background genome and simple reference based mapping 9 .
