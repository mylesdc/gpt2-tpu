In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory-confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation.",

There are 16 different HAs and nine different NA present in wild birds. 1 Frequently, wild birds infect poultry resulting in the culling of millions of birds and significant economic losses. However, wild birds rarely show disease symptoms while IAV in poultry usually exhibits respiratory tropism and is able to mutate into a more highly pathogenic form. 2 Influenza is also a zoonotic disease, and the virus is occasionally transmitted from infected poultry to humans. Certain HA/ NA combinations, however, seem to be more favorable for human infections. H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have caused several devastating outbreaks in humans in the past such as the 1918 \"Spanish flu,\" the 1957 \"Asian pandemic,\" the 1968 \"Hong Kong pandemic,\" and the 2009 \"Swine flu,\" respectively. 3 Currently, the recently emerged H7N9 strain is of concern for global public health. Low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 was first discovered in humans in 2013 in China when three patients were hospitalized with severe and fatal influenza. 4 Since then, there have been six epidemic H7N9 waves that resulted in 1567 laboratory-confirmed human infections and 615 deaths and a seventh wave is currently ongoing. 5 Intriguingly, the virus isolated from the 2013 outbreak was suggested to be derived from chickens that did not show any (or only very mild) symptoms of disease. Further investigations revealed that the viral genes were exclusively from avian origin. 4 To this date, there are no reports of H7N9 human to human transmissions even though it cannot be excluded in very few cases.",

Cleavage occurs at the C-terminus of the fusion peptide and results in its exposure allowing HA to induce fusion of the viral and cellular membrane and subsequent release of the RNA into the host cell. 6,7 LPAI viruses have a monobasic cleavage site that consists of a single arginine, which is preceded by three amino acids that are influenza subtype-specific. While LPAI viruses in wild birds are usually cleaved by trypsin in their gastro-intestinal tract, there are trypsin-like serine proteases in humans and poultry that reside in the respiratory tract and which are able to process these viruses. Therefore, the disease is usually confined to this tissue. 8 Only very little is known about the activation of H7N9 viruses. Previously, it was reported that the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 plays a role in the cleavage of H7N9 HA and activation of the virus in mice. 9, 10 Both studies showed that TMPRSS2 knockout (KO) mice were highly tolerant to H7N9 infections. When KO mice were complemented with human or mouse TMPRSS2, their susceptibility to the virus was restored. 9 We recently reported that human matriptase/ST 14 was able to very efficiently cleave a H7N9 cleavage motif peptide mimic. 11 Matriptase/ST 14 is a membrane-bound protease localized in epithelial cells of various tissues in humans that seems to play a significant role in the activation of various influenza A subtypes such H1N1 and H9N2. 12, 13 However, results obtained using cleavage site peptide mimics do not always reflect the in vivo situation and need to be validated. 11, 14 Here, we show that human matriptase/ ST The pCMV-MLVgag-pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, the pTG-Luc transfer vector encoding luciferase reporter, and pCAGGS/VSV-G plasmid were described before. 15, 16 Recombinant human matriptase/ST 14 was purchased from R&D systems.

For the control, 0.8 mM Trypsin in PBS was added for 10 minutes. Cells were then processed for Western blot analysis as previously described. 12 The antibody to detect A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9 HA (NR48765) was obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository. The secondary antibody had an Alexa fluor 488 tag and was purchased from Invitrogen. Western blot membranes were scanned using a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad) to facilitate exposure in a linear range. Bands were quantified using ImageJ software, and cleavage efficiencies for HA 1 were calculated by the following equation: (HA 1 /[HA 0 + HA 1 ])*100. Graph was generated using Graphpad Prism 7 software. ",

(A) Western blot analysis of H7N9 HA cleavage. (B) Quantification of the percent HA cleavage from (A) 90 minutes. No protease was added to the negative control and incubation with trypsin served as a positive control. We did not observe any cleavage of H7N9 HA without protease, and very efficient cleavage when trypsin was added (Figure 1A). Recombinant human matriptase/ST 14 cleaved H7N9, too, but to a lesser extent than trypsin (Figure 1A). Quantification revealed that trypsin converted about 80% of HA 0 into HA 1 and matriptase/ST 14 proteolytically processed about 30% HA 0 into HA 1 (Figure 1B). Next, we were interested to see whether matriptase/ST 14-mediated cleavage of H7N9 HA results in a fusogenic active protein. Therefore, we expressed H7N9 HA in VERO cells and incubated the cells subsequently with recombinant human matriptase/ST 14 for three hours. Controls were as described above. The negative control without added protease did not show cell fusion (Figure 2). However, when trypsin and matriptase/ST 14 were added to cells expressing H7N9 HA, strong syncytia formation was observed (Figure 2).",

This emphasizes that requirements for virus activation largely remain the same even though antigenically different strains have evolved over the past 6 years. However, we have no data to predict if matriptase/ST 14 would be able to proteolytically process these changed cleavage sites.We recently showed that matriptase/ST 14 cleaved a peptide representing the H7N9 LPAI HA cleavage motif very efficiently using an assay with fluorogenic peptides representing different HA subtype cleavage site mimics. A limitation of this assay is that peptides may produce false-positive results because the structural interaction between protease and cleavage site might be altered compared to the full-length HA protein. Matriptase/ST 14, for example, was reported to proteolytically process the A/ Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA cleavage site motif in peptide assays.12,14 When matriptase/ST 14 was then tested with the A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA full-length protein expressed in cells, only little cleavage that did not produce fusogenic HA or no cleavage was observed.Here we demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 cleaves H7N9 HA expressed in cells resulting in a fully fusogenic active protein validating our results from the previously published peptide assay. Matriptase/ST 14-mediated cleavage of H7N9 HA also promoted the infectivity of pseudovirions and A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus in cell culture. Our data indicate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a relevant protease to cause LPAI H7N9 infectivity in humans and may represent an important pathogenicity determinant and target for therapeutic intervention.ACK N OWLED G EM ENTSWe thank Stacey Shultz Cherry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA, for providing the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus used in this study and Dr Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY, USA, for sharing the H7N9 HA and NA expression plasmids.
