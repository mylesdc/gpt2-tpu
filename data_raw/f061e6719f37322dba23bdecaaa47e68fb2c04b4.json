During a 27month period, clinical and laboratory information was collected from all children and adults in two Swiss tertiary centres whose respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses with a 16-plex rtPCR test. Results: Pathogens were identified in 140 of 254 patients (55%); of those patients, there was \u22651 virus in 91 (65%), \u2265 1 bacterium in 53 (38%), and \u22651 virus and bacterium in 11 (8%). Of 80 patients with viral infection, 59 (74%) received antibiotics. Virus detection was associated with discontinuation of antibiotics in 2 of 20 adults (10%) and 6 of 14 children (43%). Overall 12 adults (34%) and 18 children (67%) were managed correctly without antibiotics after virus detection (p = 0.01). When taking biomarkers, radiologic presentations, and antibiotic pre-treatment into account, the impact of rtPCR and appropriateness of therapy for clinically viral infections increased to 100% in children and 62% in adults. Conclusions: A substantial reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions seems possible. Appropriate application of rtPCR results in respiratory tract infections should be encouraged.",

            "text": "Establishing the etiology of respiratory tract infections (RTI) is often difficult due to the lack of a diagnostic gold standard and the inability to detect the causative pathogen. A large proportion of RTI is believed to be caused by respiratory viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . With widespread availability of molecular methods such as multiplex realtime polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR), clinical workflow has changed dramatically and the sensitivity of viral diagnostics has increased remarkably compared to conventional methods [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, the significance of virus detection remains unclear as the presence of a virus does not prove causality. Many respiratory viruses can be carried by asymptomatic children [4, 6, 14] and can be shed over prolonged periods, thus discrimination between carriage and infection is challenging [13] [14] [15] . Viral infection was reported previously to predispose to bacterial super-infection and concerns about possible bacterial co-infection remain [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Ruling out a bacterial infection with traditional microbiological techniques is frequently impossible [1, 5] . The predictive value of clinical signs to differentiate between viral and bacterial infection is also low [13, 17, [20] [21] [22] . On these grounds, clinical management of patients after respiratory virus diagnosis is controversial and surprisingly poorly studied. Overall, extensive yet often unnecessary use of antibiotics in RTI is common [1, 5, 6] . This adult and pediatric retrospective cohort study analyzed whether identification of a virus by multiplex rtPCR was associated with changes in the antibiotic treatment.",

The guidelines are strongly recommended for use but not strictly reinforced, and include use of rtPCR as optional diagnostic in hospitalized patients, particularly with immune suppression. The study period was from September 2012 (when this assay was introduced) to November 2014. The documented application dates of anti-infective medication were matched with the date of rtPCR analysis in order to determine whether treatment was changed in response to rtPCR results. The main outcome of interest was whether antibiotic therapy was modified according to results of multiplex rtPCR. Secondary outcomes were prevalence and distribution of positive results of rtPCR, complications, length of stay (LOS), and antibiotic therapy depending on identified pathogens.",

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 107 adults with lower RTI, antibiotics were partially or totally discontinued in 6 (11%) of 55 patients for whom rtPCR results were available, albeit without overall reduction in antibiotic treatment duration [7] . In a controlled clinical trial enrolling 583 children with acute RTI, Wishaupt et al. [4] evaluated the diagnostic yield and effect of rapid communication of rtPCR results (within 12-36 h vs. 4 weeks after testing) and failed to show a significant influence on the duration of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, Brittain-Long et al. [20] demonstrated in a RCT with 406 adults that patients randomized to rapid rtPCR results received antibiotics less frequently for acute RTI in a primary care setting during their initial visit (4.5% vs. 12.3%; p = 0.01). However, at the 10-day follow-up the prescription rates were similar again (13.9% vs. 17.2%; p = 0.36) [20] . Contrary to these findings, a retrospective pre-post study of 3.2 days; p = 0.003) without reducing the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions [26] .",

Due to this technical limitation, missing a treatable pathogen is of concern in light of potential bacterial-viral co-infections [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [16] [17] [18] [19] . It was shown that clinical suspicion of a bacterial super-infection was one reason for physicians to not stop antibiotics in rtPCR-positive patients [3] . We tried to partially overcome this by creating categories of clinically bacterial and clinically viral infections. This definition, aided by providing a biomarker criterion, accounted for the possibility of a viral infection in the setting of bacterial carriage. One of the major differences and advantages of the current study compared to previous publications is that it not only assessed the impact of the rtPCR results, which themselves had a limited impact on appropriate therapy, but it also integrated other 'real-world' clinical and radiologic parameters into the decision process.",

A mixed bacterial-viral etiology was found in 11 (8%) OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval patients. Previously described rates varied between 2 and 23% [17, 19, 22, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Some studies suggested that mixed bacterial-viral infections result in more severe clinical diseases (as measured by the CURB-65 score or the pneumonia severity index) [17, 34] , a higher rate of mechanical ventilation, longer duration of ICU care [36, 37] , longer hospital stays [22, 36] , or higher mortality [37, 38] , while other studies did not [29, 39, 40] . In this study, mixed bacterial-viral infections were associated with a higher rate of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation compared to pure viral (p = 0.05; p = 0.005) and pure bacterial (p = 0.06; p = 0.19) infections if all patients were considered. However, these results should not be viewed as representative of the etiology of lower RTI in East Switzerland as these hospitals presented a preselected group of patients. In agreement with the findings of some studies [20, 22, 34] and in contrast to others [7, 29, 39] , this study failed to identify specific predictors of viral detection in multivariate logistic regression. Advancing age was previously described as more common in viral infections [19, 22, 29, 35] but the evidence is inconclusive [31, 32] . In this study, younger age was a significant predictor of virus detection in univariable logistic regression if all patients were considered, but not in stratified analyses in children and adults. The mean age in the group with respiratory viral infections was lower than in the remaining patients (29 vs. 47 years; p < 0.001) but the differences were not significant if stratified for children and adults.",

Exact time specifications were not available, leaving room for potential inaccuracies. It is not known whether and to what extent these or other factors contributed to the clinical decisions in starting, stopping, or continuing antibiotic therapy. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, it was not possible to consider the clinical presentation in the analysis. Therefore, it was difficult to reproduce the decision-making process and the primary indication for antibiotic therapy. This is an important limitation because clinical judgement remains essential concerning the use of antibiotics [41] . Furthermore, data on the consequences of rtPCR results on antibiotic treatment are difficult to obtain in the ambulatory setting, which explains the relatively small number of enrolled outpatients. Prospective studies or ideally RCTs will be necessary to confirm the findings.",
