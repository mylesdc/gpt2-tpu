The mass mortality caused by variety of pathogens (virus, bacteria and parasites) is main problem in aquaculture industry, including in olive flounder culture. In this study, we carried out transcriptome analysis using the olive flounder gill tissues after infection of three types of pathogens (Virus; Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Bacteria; Streptococcus parauberis, and Parasite; Miamiensis avidus), respectively. As a result, we identified total 12,415 differentially expressed genes (DEG) from viral infection, 1,754 from bacterial infection, and 795 from parasite infection, respectively. To investigate the effects of pathogenic infection on immune response, we analyzed Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with DEGs and sorted immune-related GO terms per three pathogen groups. Especially, we verified various GO terms, and genes in these terms showed down-regulated expression pattern. In addition, we identified 67 common genes (10 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated) present in three pathogen infection groups. Our goals are to provide plenty of genomic knowledge about olive flounder transcripts for further research and report genes, which were changed in their expression after specific pathogen infection.",

Mass mortality of fishes is the most severe problem, accompanying vast deficit in aquaculture farm. Efforts to prevent regrettable death have especially been conducted in immunology 1-3 . However, so far, it is hard to figure out cause of death exactly in short time because of variables of expansive marine ecosystem. Mass mortality of olive flounder was normally caused by diseases via various sources of infection such as virus, bacteria, or parasite from external environment.",

The six gene were contained in the VHSV genome of about 11 K bases and each of them coded nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), nonstructural viral protein (NV), and RNA polymerase (L) in the following order 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5' 4 . Infection of VHSV results in contagious viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in diverse fish species regardless of their inhabitation; seawater or freshwater 5 . In East Asia, a lot of infection cases into olive flounder have been reported steadily, since VHSV was detected in middle of 1990s [6] [7] [8] [9] . A variety of scuticociliates have been reported as cause of scuticociliatosis in marine species including turbot, guppy, and southern bluefin tuna [10] [11] [12] . In olive flounder, disease has been reported to be causing from various scuticociliates; Uronema marinum, Pseudocohnilembus persalinus, Philasterides dicentrarchi, Miamiensis avidus [13] [14] [15] [16] . Interestingly, judging from infection experiments using various scuticociliates plus identification outcome of 8 isolates acquired from olive flounders with symptom of ulcers and haemorrhages, Miamiensis avidus was suggested as the major aetiologic agent of scuticociliatosis because of high pathogenicity and mortality rate compared with other scuticociliates 14, 17 .",

A large number of immunologic studies have been proceeded about various immune-related gens against pathogen infection 3, [24] [25] [26] [27] . A huge quantity of genomic information from next generation sequencing (NGS) technique has been gradually increasing for the last few years, indicating that researchers could approach more comprehensive understanding view about genome of organisms than when they research a single gene level. With development of wide-sized analysis methods, it is not difficult to figure out change of gene expression level after any chemical treatment or environmental change. Recently, studies to identify large-scale genes were conducted in the olive flounder genome for researches about vaccine, gonadal development, and sex determination [28] [29] [30] . In particular, characterizing of immune-related genes was reported in olive flounder spleen tissue 31 . A lot of studies reported earlier were focused on gene expression analysis of single pathogen and specifically defined the expression pattern of limited genes [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Further, infection by two or more pathogens were reported in the olive flounder genome 37, 38 . In order to solve these problem, we need plentiful genomic information to respond rapidly to multiple infection of pathogens. However, researches, which were comprehensively analysed about change of gene expression pattern by different type of pathogens, have not been reported in the olive flounder genome, so far.",

To profile gene expression after infection of three pathogens (VHSV, Streptococcus parauberis, and Miamiensis avidus), transcriptome analysis was conducted using gill tissues of olive flounders, respectively. We prepared twelve olive flounders (three un-infected individuals as control, three virus-infected, three bacteria-infected, and three parasite-infected individuals) to raise confidence. To gain the sufficient number of transcripts, twelve independent RNA samples acquired from normal and pathogen-infected olive flounder gill tissues were employed for construction of cDNA library. Then, these cDNA libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500, generating the numbers of approximately 78.4 million, 65.2 million, and 45.7 million raw reads from three control samples, 44.0 million, 56.9 million, and 62.0 million raw reads from bacteria-infected samples, 41.2 million, 62.4 million, and 40.0 million raw reads from virus-infected samples, 39.6 million, 41.6 million, and 53.1 million raw reads from parasite-infected samples, respectively (Table 1) . After trimming of low-quality reads and adaptor sequences, the number of clean reads acquired from control samples were average 62.3 million reads from control samples, average 53.5 million reads from bacteria-infected samples, average 48.0 million reads from virus-infected samples, and average 44.3 million reads from parasite-infected samples, respectively. Then, we checked gene coverage whether the reads that we acquired are sufficient for quantitative gene expression analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The clean reads were assembled into 120,880 transcript sequences acquired from transcriptome analysis, we identified total 40,100 genes involving novel 19,560 genes from transcript sequences using InterProScan database and non-redundant protein database in the NCBI ( Table 2 ).",

A fundamental way to overcome disease outbreak from external pathogens is to approach from their genome level. It is essential to expand quantity of genomic information in pursuance of biological research about any target. Investigation of overall gene expression change after pathogen infection would provide clues of cause of biological damage. Gene regulation is essential for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed. Phylogenetic diversity of pathogens (virus, bacteria and parasite) is also responsible for differential expression of genes in diseases. Each individual pathogen causes disease in a different way, which makes it challenging to understand the basic biology of infection. In this study, we understood the relation between three types of pathogen infection and differential gene expression in the olive flounder genome through transcriptome analysis, respectively. The diverse pathogens used in this study, carry specific antigenic variations, which refers to the specific mechanism by which an infectious agent infect the fish and progress the disease. Transcriptome analysis help us to understand the progression of disease in fish through pathogen infection based on diversity of pathogen (virus, bacteria and parasite). This study shows differentially expressed genes were up-and down-regulated at different extend in fish tissue. Interestingly, virus and bacteria have more down-regulated genes while parasite have more up-regulated genes. This data signifies the fact that fish immune system interacts with bacteria and virus with the same strategy, while with parasite different due to difference in mode of infections between them. For efficient prevention against pathogen, it is important to understand which genes were activated/repressed after pathogen infection because their expression change means variation of metabolic system in body. In this study, we identified total number of 12,415 in VHSV infection group, 1,754 in Streptococcus parauberis infection group, and 795 DEGs from Miamiensis avidus infection group, respectively (Table 3 ). Given the difference in the number of DEGs among three pathogen groups, these results seemed that virus had the most impact on gene expression mechanism in the olive flounder genome among three pathogens. Interestingly, 11,051 DEGs (89% of all DEGs) showed down-regulated pattern after viral infection. This phenomenon that global gene expression was decreased by viral infection must cause pathogenic disease by affecting immune-related gene expression level, finally leads to death. This view was supported by our findings (Supplementary Table 2 ), which showed expression decrease pattern of all genes in the immune-related GO terms. Especially, GO terms in viral infection group showed that all genes tend to be down-regulated after pathogen infection, indicating loss of resistance against pathogens by down-regulating the expression of immune-related genes. Like this situation, functional information of genes acquired from GO enrichment could help researcher to figure out critical biological pathway against any external factor.",

The understanding of fish immune system structure and function is essential for the development of new technologies and products to improve productivity. The transcriptome analysis bring exposure to basic difference in expression profile of all pathogens in the host. These differences were due to nature of parasite, their mode of infection, antigenic variations and many other factors. Additionally, along with all above differences, disease progressed in host due to external surface variation of pathogens (viral, parasite and bacterial) and their appropriate recognition by host immune systems for making the basis to initiate microbial clearance 44, 45 . Disease research requires the knowledge of important key factors like method of avoiding host immune surveillance, antigenic variations, subversion of immune responses through phagocyte and inhibition of cytokines and chemokines in common with pathogen infections (viral, bacterial and parasite) 44, 45 . On the other hand, the disease progression was different in accordance to type of pathogens. In case of viral infection, understanding of complement inhibition and blockade of cellular immunity is the most important, while parasite and bacterial infections required knowledge and research of innate pathway and acquired immunity 44, 45 . Our analysis indicates the complexity and difference of expression profile could be due to all the above reasons. In addition, important basis of fish vaccine is depending on innate and adaptive immunity 46 . There were many vaccine types which depend upon antigens, live microorganisms or specific DNA segment of pathogens or polyvalent vaccines. All above vaccines required complete knowledge of pathogenicity and deep research of efficacy 47 . Our study clearly indicates about various immune and antigenic genes which can be chosen for pathways analysis and use for therapeutic agents or as some vaccine candidates (Supplementary Table 2) .",

In this view, CD13, which is one of down-regulated genes by infection of three pathogens on common, was reported to inactivate interleukin 8 49 .

The differentially expressed genes identified from transcriptome analysis using three types of pathogens could be useful to study the basic diagnosis and therapeutic mechanisms, and offer opportunities for designing the appropriate vaccines or drug targets for pathogen specific candidate genes. Because of lack of genomic information or using one external infection factor, previous studies have been limited to understand global expression pattern of whole genes in the olive flounder genome. We hope that this research would contribute to achieve great outcome in various biological field.",

Building of transcriptome libraries were conducted by Illumina's TruSeq RNA protocol, and 1-2 \u03bcg of total RNA were used in each samples. AMPure XP beads (BECKMAN COULTER) and Ambion Fragmentation Reagents kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used for extraction of Poly(A)+ RNA and their fragment, respectively. As the following steps, cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina indexed adapters were carried out according to Illumina's protocol. The size-selected 250-300 bp cDNA fragments were loaded on a 3% Nusieve 3:1 (Lonza) agarose gel for libraries. The cDNA fragments were recovered using QIAEX II gel extraction reagents (Qiagen), and amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 14 PCR cycles. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPure XP beads, their concentration and product sizes were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing of paired-end libraries were conducted with the Illumina HiSeq2500, (2 \u00d7 100 nucleotide read length).",

Processed reads were mapped to the Olive flounder draft genome (Submitted at present) using tophat and cufflink with default parameters 76 . The differential analysis was performed using Cuffdiff 76 using default parameters. Further, the FPKM values from Cuffdiff were normalized and quantitated using R Package Tag Count Comparison (TCC) 77 to determine statistical significance (e.g., P values) and differential expression (e.g., fold changes.).
