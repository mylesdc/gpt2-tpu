This study also commented on the viability of the ARIMA model for hospital bed planning and for other critical resources during epidemics of infectious diseases (8) .

In some cases, the names ARIMA and Box-Jenkins are mentioned as synonyms. This model is based on an adjustment of observed values, and its goal is to reduce as close to zero as possible the difference between the values produced in the model and the observed ones. Quite possibly, this model can describe behaviors of stationary and nonstationary series, giving versatility to situational variances. Series are stationary when their mean and variance are constant throughout time, and when the value of covariance depends only on a gap between two time periods. Random shocks occur in nonstationary series increasing mean displacement and variance, violating the stationary condition of the series (2) . Some important observations in the creation of an explicative model are the need for at least 50 observations. For disease management programs, at least 4 years of data are required until the first month of intervention. Therefore, the model has the ability to place eventual patterns that could interfere in the arrangement of parameters (2) . Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the ARIMA model of process estimation. A wide variety of ARIMA models are found. The general format of the nonseasonal model is the AMIRA (p, d, q) being AR: (p=degree of the autoregressive part); I: (d=degree of the first difference involved), and MA: (q= degree of the mean part that is mobile).",

Time series is an analytical tool to study diseases and resources management at healthcare institutions. The flexibility to follow up and recognize data patterns and provide explanations must not be neglected in studies of healthcare interventions. In this study, the ARIMA model was introduced without the use of mathematical details or other extensions to the model. The investigator or the healthcare organization involved in disease management programs could have great advantages when using analytical methodology in several areas, with the ability to perform provisions in many cases. Despite the analytical possibility by statistical means, this approach does not replace investigators' common sense and experience in disease interventions.",
