We introduce a simulation optimization (SIMOP) approach for forecasting the influenza epidemic curve. This study represents the final step of a project aimed at using a combination of simulation, classification, statistical and optimization techniques to forecast the epidemic curve and infer underlying model parameters during an influenza outbreak. The SIMOP procedure combines an individualbased model and the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method. The method is used to forecast epidemics simulated over synthetic social networks representing Montgomery County in Virginia, Miami, Seattle and surrounding metropolitan regions. The results are presented for the first four weeks. Depending on the synthetic network, the peak time could be predicted within a 95% CI as early as seven weeks before the actual peak. The peak infected and total infected were also accurately forecasted for Montgomery County in Virginia within the forecasting period. Forecasting of the epidemic curve for both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks is a complex problem, however this is a preliminary step and the results suggest that more can be achieved in this area.",

These methods were also used to monitor influenza activity during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [19] [20] [21] . In addition, several methods have been proposed for real-time modeling and forecasting of epidemic dynamics [9, 11, [22] [23] [24] . Hall et al. [24] proposed using a deterministic compartmental model to estimate epidemic dynamics. Their method was used to retrospectively predict the amplitude and durations of three pre-2006 influenza pandemic events in England and Wales. They used regression techniques to fit a time-series disease incidence curve obtained from a traditional differential equation epidemiology model to the mortality and influenza-like illness (ILI) data for the three pandemics. This technique required estimation of nine parameters, including the reproduction number. The model also assumed knowledge of the natural history of the disease from detailed epidemiological studies in the early stages of the pandemic.",

Hsieh [26] also employed the same model to estimate parameters for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in six countries in the southern hemisphere. Similarly, Nishiura presented a discrete time stochastic model for forecasting the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [23] . To retrospectively forecast the pandemic in Japan, a likelihood-based approach was used in parameter estimation. Ohkusa et al. [23] also used a simple SIR model for forecast during the pandemic. In contrast, Ong et al. [11] described a real-time system to both monitor and forecast different epidemic outcome measures in Singapore during the 2009 pandemic. The surveillance system collected data on ILI instances from twenty three participating general practice and family doctor clinics in Singapore. Since H1N1 had low hospitalization and mortality rates, the study did not use hospital and fatality data. A stochastic compartmental model with particle filtering was used in real-time epidemic incidence forecast. ILI data collected at general practice and family doctor clinics in Singapore was refitted each day to provide sequential updates on forecasts.",

Forecasts of the characteristics of the 2009 influenza pandemic in addition to the potential effects of interventions were made for Los Angeles (LA) county. The forecasting process combined the stochastic model with a monitoring system established by the LA county department of public health. The stochastic epidemic simulation model used by Chao et al [9] is similar to that used in this study. Both models seek to represent individuals and interactions between individuals. However, there are differences in the data sources, the method of constructing the networks and some of the assumptions in the disease model. There are also differences in the manner in which the models are used in forecasting. In this study we present an approach which combines an individual-based model and an optimization technique to recursively estimate model parameters and forecast the epidemic curve as data is sequentially updated during an epidemic. Shaman et al [27] employed a similar approach based on an assimilation of various models to achieve forecasts of the peak time seven weeks in advance. In this study, we seek to forecast the peak time in addition to the expected peak infected and total infected population. To our knowledge, the approach presented in this paper has not been previously studied.",

During an epidemic, ILI or other forms of surveillance data can be obtained from sources such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FluNet, Distribute Project, etc. Given the availability of surveillance data, we describe the process as follows. First, we build a library of past and simulated epidemics. Simulated epidemics are replicated several times to capture the variability in the system. Using a classification approach, we propose a parameter set to model a new outbreak at time t based on available data up to time t. We use random forest; a supervised tree-based classification method to assign the new epidemic to an existing case in the library. Random forest is efficient on large databases, tends to achieve a high accuracy on most classification problems and enables estimation of importance variables, which is especially useful for data sets with many variables [28] . The efficacy of random forest in classification of partial epidemic curves was illustrated in [29] . If the match suggested by random forest is considered suitable, then the parameters of the epidemic in the library are used in modeling the new outbreak. On the contrary, if none of the epidemics in the library is deemed a good match, then we recursively apply a combination of simulation and optimization methods to propose new parameters.",

By providing forecasts for a particular region, informed decisions can be made at a regional level on how to best control the disease outbreak especially when vaccinations are unavailable. Differences observed between social networks could be due to demographic differences, which have been suggested to influence epidemic spread and transmissibility [2, 42, 43] . Several studies have suggested that school children tend to impact the spread of influenza [44] [45] [46] [47] . Positive correlations have also been found between the attack rate and the proportion of children within a population [42] . The percentage of the population consisting of children is approximately 27:1% for Seattle compared to 16:6% and 21:7% for MC in Virginia and Miami respectively.
