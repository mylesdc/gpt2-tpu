A broad spectrum therapeutic that can target multiple virus families would have a significant impact on disease burden in endemic areas. Nucleoside analogs are a class of small-molecule antivirals which can directly inhibit viral transcription and replication by targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and have been used as backbone components of combination therapies against both Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1, 2 . A 1\u2032 -cyano substituted adenine nucleoside analog GS-441524 (\"Nuc\") was shown to have activity against HCV, dengue virus (DenV), parainfluenza type 3 virus (hPIV3), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3 . GS-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of Nuc that has shown activity against filoviruses and coronaviruses in cell-based antiviral assays 4 . More importantly, this compound protected non-human primates from lethal Ebola virus infection when given therapeutically beginning 3 days post-inoculation, and is currently in phase 2 clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease.",

            "text": "To determine the full spectrum of activity of Nuc and GS-5734 against a wide panel of human viral pathogens, the antiviral activity was determined using a variety of cell-based assays. Nuc was active against recombinant reporter-expressing NiV 5 , EBOV 6, 7 , and Marburg viruses (MARV) 8 , with observed 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC 50 ) values between 1-3 \u03bc M (Table 1 Table 1 ). The EC 50 values derived from the different assays using wild-type viruses closely paralleled the values observed from the reporter viruses (Supplementary Table 1 ) (For details regarding the different assays used, please see Methods section). Moreover, at concentrations between 5-16 \u03bc M, Nuc was able to reduce infectious virus production of NiV and EBOV by greater than 5 logs (Supplementary Figure 4) . To explore the range of Nuc antiviral activity across the Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae 9 families, we tested Nuc against reporter viruses from representative genera including MV 10 , hPIV3 11 , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 12 , human metapneumovirus 13 (hMPV), as well as wild-type MV and MuV 14 ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2) . While EC 50 values for Nuc against MV, hPIV3, hMPV, and RSV ranged between 0.5 to 2 \u03bc M, the EC 50 value against MuV was consistently in the 7-12 \u03bc M range. However, when we tested Nuc against viruses from unrelated families such as Arenaviridae (Lassa virus (LASV)), Rhabdoviridae (Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV)), Bunyaviridae (Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) 15 , Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) 16 ), and several tick-borne members of Flaviviridae (Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever virus (AHFV), Kyasanur Forest Disease virus (KFDV), Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever virus (OHFV), Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV)), we observed little to no antiviral activity (Table 1; Supplementary Figures 1-3; Supplementary Table 1) .",

            "text": "GS-5734 is a prodrug that is designed to deliver the nucleoside monophosphate into the cell, thereby circumventing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step and allowing for efficient formation of the active triphosphate species. Consistent with this notion, GS-5734 exhibited 10 to 100-fold higher antiviral potency relative to Nuc when tested against reporter and wild-type filo-, pneumo-, and paramyxoviruses, yielding EC 50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.79 \u03bc M (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2 ; Supplementary Figures 6-8) . Moreover, GS-5734 was able to reduce infectious virus production of NiV and EBOV by greater than 4 logs but at much lower concentrations than Nuc, reflecting the more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active form (Table 1 To determine whether structural and sequence similarities of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) would provide additional insight into the observed antiviral spectrum, we took a hybrid approach that used both structural homology and primary protein sequence information to align the secondary structure of nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) from known crystal structures of various viral RdRps. Distinct ssRNA virus families do not necessarily share a common ancestor in the traditional phylogenetic sense, thus the primary sequence and structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) can be quite divergent. We therefore examined all available viral RdRP crystal structures and utilized secondary structure to align the nucleotide binding domains in iterative fashion by removing non-homologous regions. This resulted in a compelling structural alignment for the nucleotide binding domains, despite the overall structures of RdRPs being very different (Fig. 1B) . For example, structural alignments of HCV against DenV (Fig. 1C) and VSV (Fig. 1D ) RdRP nucleotide binding domains both show good overlap in the nucleotide binding regions, but have significant differences globally. This structural alignment informed the extraction of two 10-residue regions within motifs A and B that interact directly with the nucleotide [18] [19] [20] (Fig. 1A) . Sequence similarity clustering analysis of these regions correlated with the observed spectrum of antiviral activity across virus families (Fig. 2) . For instance we observe that while HCV and DenV are both inhibited by GS-5734 and have high sequence similarity among motifs A and B, VSV which is not inhibited by GS-5734 has low sequence similarity among motifs A and B when compared to HCV and other negative strand RNA viruses susceptible to GS-5734 inhibition. Taken together, our results expand the spectrum of viruses susceptible to Nuc and GS-5734, and further define their respective antiviral activities across 7 virus families. The unique potent broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 against paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses provides an opportunity to explore the compound for the treatment of highly pathogenic infections such as NiV and MERS-CoV in non-human primates, in addition to EBOV and other filoviruses. Depending on further careful assessment of its safety and efficacy profile, GS-5734 could also be considered for the treatment of prevalent respiratory infections (RSV, hPIV3, hMPV), as well as for controlling recurring outbreaks of MV globally among under-vaccinated populations.",

Primary antibodies used for each respective virus are indicated in the following: NiV minigenome assay. A Nanoluciferase-based NiV minigenome assay was adapted from a previously developed NiV minigenome assay 30 . Briefly, a bacteriophage T7 polymerase-based NiV minigenome was synthesized (Genscript) expressing a reporter fusion construct of Nanoluciferase (Promega) and mNeonGreen fluorescent protein 31 . The open reading frame encoding the reporter fusion protein was flanked by a T7 promoter, hammerhead ribozyme, and NiV leader with N gene untranslated region at the 3\u2032 end, and the L gene untranslated region, NiV trailer, and Hepatitis delta ribozyme at the 5\u2032 end. HeLa cells (5,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and transfected with appropriate amounts of NiV support plasmids (N (50 ng/well), P (32 ng) and L (50 ng)), HeV minigenome (120 ng) and T7 polymerase (80 ng) prepared in RNase-free TE buffer, mixed with 0.8 \u03bc L/well LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) and 10 \u03bc L Opti-MEM/well. Complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before adding to cells. Compounds were added directly to the cells 4 h post-transfection. For negative controls, the L plasmid was substituted with an equivalent amount of pcDNA 3.1 plasmid expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry (Clontech). 48 h post-transfection of minigenome plasmids, 50 \u03bc L of Nanoluciferase assay buffer solution (Promega) was added directly to each well. Well contents were transferred to opaque white plates, and after three minutes, luminescence was read on a plate reader (HT-Synergy, Biotek). CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega) was added immediately following reporter minigenome luminescence reading to measure cell viability according to manufacturer's guidelines. The average raw luminescence value for untreated non-transfected cells was set as 100% cell viability. Percent (%) cell viability for individual wells were calculated by dividing their respective raw luminescence values by the average raw luminescence value for non-transfected cells. Reporter Nanoluciferase activity for each well was then normalized by dividing the nanoluciferase luminescence value by its respective % cell viability as determined above.",

We therefore examined all available viral RdRP crystal structures and utilized secondary structure to align the nucleotide binding domains in iterative fashion by removing non-homologous regions. This resulted in a compelling structural alignment for the nucleotide binding domains (Supplementary Figure 12) , although the overall structures of RdRPs were quite divergent. This allowed us to determine functionally homologous nucleotide binding residues (motifs A and B) [18] [19] [20] . We extracted the primary amino acid sequences (10 residues each) and aligned them by homology to viral RdRPs without known crystal structures using the global-local pairwise alignment in the Biostrings package in R. Grouping of these sequences was determined by calculating a distance matrix followed by hierarchical linkage clustering. The distance matrix was estimated by taking the negative values of Smith-Waterman alignments (gap open penalty of -5, extension penalty of -1, and match/mismatch values derived from BLOSUM62). Clustering was performed using hclust in R. Results were comparable to those derived from multiple sequence alignments on the extracted regions using MUSCLE 32 ",
