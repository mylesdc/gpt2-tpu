Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses.",

Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by esfenvalerate exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. a. b. * (LC 50 = 0.19 \u03bcg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.04 \u03bcg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.38 \u03bcg.L -1 ) (LC 50 = 0.24 \u03bcg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.11 \u03bcg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.13 \u03bcg.L -1 )",

It was listed as endangered in 2009, under both the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and California Endangered Species Act (CESA). Considerable efforts are presently being made to understand the causes of this recent population decline [4, 5] , especially because several other pelagic species have shown similar population trends. Delta habitats have been compromised by a number of complex factors, both known and unknown, potentially affecting aquatic species throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin watersheds and estuary [4] . Pollution, in the form of chemicals contained in runoff from agricultural and urban areas, and old mining sites, treated wastewater effluent, along with the effects of water exports, invasive species and habitat destruction are amongst potential causes for the population decline of several pelagic species [5] .",

Contaminants may not only affect organism survival, but can compromise ecological fitness of individual species via sublethal physiological, behavioral or immunological effects (e.g. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ), consequently altering food web and ecosystem dynamics. However, such physiological endpoints are often difficult to determine in field studies, because they either require behavioral observation and measurements, or because affected individuals will not survive in the wild. Similarly, widely used ecotoxicological tools such as standard toxicity tests [11, 12] cannot easily be adapted to resident species of concern, and, conversely, it is problematic to extrapolate test results obtained with surrogate species to resident species of concern [13] . Recent comparative studies have demonstrated a need for identifying effects directly in the species of concern, as traditional model organisms may differ in sensitivity and physiological response to environmental contaminants and other stressors [14, 15] .",

            "text": "Carefully selected molecular biomarkers can provide species-specific and sensitive, mechanistic information on the overall health of an organism, as toxic responses are often preceded by alterations in gene expression [16, 17] . In particular microarray gene profiling is a powerful tool for defining genome-wide effects of environmental change on biological function [16, 18, 19] . The predictive value of microarrays as screening tools, as well as our understanding of these responses and their application in the field of ecotoxicology is rapidly growing. This technology can be applied in vertebrates and invertebrates, plants, algae, cell lines and unicellular organisms [20] . In addition, links are being established between specific molecular biomarkers identified by microarray technology, and higher-level life history parameters, such as metabolism, growth and reproduction [16, 18, 21, 22] . Gene expression studies carried out over short-term exposures have allowed for the prediction of chronic stressor effects, such as reduced fecundity and embryonic arrest, somatic growth, and population dynamics [16, 18, 21, 23] . Thus, specific gene responses in studied organisms would not only be indicative of health status, but when used in conservation studies, could highlight potential causes for population decline. However, few biomarkers are currently understood well enough to provide conclusive evidence of contaminant impacts on aquatic species in field monitoring, and extrapolating effects seen at the biomarker level to individual or population-level toxicity continues to be a challenge. For molecular biomarkers to be used as successful monitoring tools of individual, population and ecosystem damage, strong links need to continue to be established between gene expression and health status.",

No genomic information was available on any database at the time this project began, other than a few mitochondrial sequences used in taxonomic studies [24] . We describe here, the construction and first application of this tool to identify genes in the delta smelt, specifically responding to exposure to esfenvalerate, a pyrethroid insecticide, and present gene expression quantitation of selected biomarkers, utilizing these to explain observed swimming abnormalities. We used esfenvalerate in our study because biochemical responses and adverse effects on the whole organisms are relatively well understood [25] and therefore would aid interpretation of results in this \"proof of principle\" test. Esfenvalerate [(S)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(-4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate] is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, widely used in agriculture, with a high risk to aquatic organisms [26] . It causes neurological damage by blocking sodium and potassium channels, resulting in repetitive neurological discharge [25] . In addition, pyrethroid insecticides are highly soluble in myelin sheaths of nerves, causing demyelination, resulting in conduction deficiencies through nerve lesions [27] , directly affecting swimming ability, and impinging on foraging and migration. Fish are highly sensitive to this insecticide, with for example effects on bluegill behavior at measured concentrations as low as 0.025 \u03bcg/L -1 [28] . Pyrethroids have also been reported to affect growth, induce immune responses, reduce hepatic glycogen levels and delay spawning [9, 29] .",

Swimming abnormality in 10-d old larvae, intensified with increasing esfenvalerate concentration at 4 h, escalating significantly after 24 h exposure (figure 1a). This swimming abnormality was also concentration dependent in 52-d old fish, however swimming effects resulting from different time point measurements differed only at the highest exposure concentration of 0.250 \u03bcg.L -1 (figure 1b), where effects on motion increased from 22.5% anomaly at 4 h to 45% at 24 h. Behavioral abnormalities, reduced food intake and growth, as well as increased susceptibility to predation were reported in fathead minnow larvae exposed to esfenvalerate for 4 h to concentrations above 0.455 \u03bcg.L -1 [10] . Significant swimming impairments were determined in this study at 0.250 \u03bcg.L -1 , thus delta smelt are highly sensitive to sublethal esfenvalerate exposure.

Of the sequenced ESTs that responded significantly, 118 genes were successfully annotated; 170 matched unnamed or hypothetical proteins, or did not match the described annotation selection criteria; i.e. BLASTx searches resulted in expect-values greater than 1 \u00d7 10 -5 and scores below 50.

Accumulation of calcium in muscular tissue contributes to muscle degradation, muscular dystrophy and muscle fiber necrosis [35] . Estrogen is required for parvalbumin expression, thus estrogen receptor-\u03b2 co-expresses with parvalbumin [36] . Estrogen is also required in brain development and has a protective neurological role, by regulating the activity of GABAergic systems within the hippocampus, basal forebrain and hypothalamus [37] . Differential expression of parvalbumin on exposure to esfenvalerate may be resultant of estrogenic effects. Pyrethroid pesticides have steroid receptor-binding activity [38] linked with endocrine disruption [39] , thus exposure is likely to affect the population dynamics of wildlife not only through neuromuscular impairments, but also by affecting reproductive output [29, 40] . Parvalbumin, could therefore, be a good indicator of possible endocrine-disruption as well as neuromuscular impairments. Interestingly, expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA) in exposed 10-d old delta smelt larvae was significantly affected at all concentrations, downregulating with increasing esfenvalerate concentration in a dose response manner, and correlating significantly with swimming anomaly at 24 h (r = 0.913, p = 0.029). Aspartoacylase catalyzes hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) to aspartate and acetate in the vertebrate brain [41] . Variations in NAA measured in urine, blood and brain, have been used as diagnosis of nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis [42, 43] . Measurements of NAA, along with ADP levels determined by creatine kinase activity, are used to evaluate the energetic state of the brain, a positive linear correlation existing between NAA and ADP synthesis [44] . Deficiency in ASPA activity leads to degeneration of the myelin; an ensheathment that isolates and controls axonal activity, it is associated with schizophrenia [45] , and is the established cause of leukodystrophy in Canavan's disease [43] . Abnormal myelination is known to result from acyltransferase deficiency [46] . Ependymin, a myelin associated glycoprotein related to memory formation and involved in neuronal regeneration [47] , was also negatively affected by esfenvalerate. Myelin has been postulated as a probable modulator of ASPA activity [48] further affecting this critical pathway of neurological function. ASPA protein activity is a strong biomarker of brain damage and neurological impairment investigation, used regularly in human and veterinary disease diagnostics [49] .",

Enzymatic activity requires an aspartic acid residue, and plays a critical role in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines [61] that are associated with septic shock and autoimmune syndromes [62] . Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines were reported in viral infected salmon, which further increased in expression following esfenvalerate exposure [63] . Caspases contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as ischemia, Krabbes and Huntington's diseases, Alzheimer's, and other leukodystrophic diseases resulting in neural degeneration [64, 65] . Moreover, caspase inhibitors have been suggested as therapeutic treatments for neurodegenerative diseases [66] . Low concentrations of esfenvalerate; 0.0313 \u03bcg.L -1 , significantly induced caspase-3 expression 2-fold (t-test, p = 0.002) in 10-d old delta smelt. As caspases are activated by aspartic acid, induction may be suggestive of increases in substrate residues, along with inflammatory cytokines, probable effects upon the immune system, and subsequent neurodegeneration.

Hemopexin is synthesized by Schwann cells following nerve injury [67] , accumulation has been reported in the peripheral nervous system following axonal lesions, and is specifically regulated during repair, returning to normal levels on axonal regeneration [68] . Wallerian degeneration occurs after axonal injury and is critical for repair, it is characterized by axonal and myelin degeneration [69] , is accompanied by macrophage invasion and subsequent synthesis of hemopexin [67] . Hemopexin appears to play a significant role in neural regeneration, but may be resultant of oxidative stress mediated T cell activity on myelin sheaths (described above, under immune responses). Though upregulation follows nerve injury and there are strong connections with apoptosis, we classify hemopexin under oxidative stress as it has a high affinity with heme and reportedly plays a strong role in both heme transport and preventing heme-catalyzed oxidative damage [70] . Moreover, pyrethroids have been shown to generate free radicals and induce oxidative stress [71] .",

We have, however, examined and confirmed effect of esfenvalerate upon some of the genes in a different age group of larval delta smelt, identifying significant responses that are primarily linked with swimming behavior. Some responding genes can be classified within different functional groups. Due to the measured behavioral responses, the classification approach contains a certain bias towards understanding neuromuscular effects. It is interesting that qPCR measurements have identified a greater response at the lower concentrations, implying homeostatic alterations, at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most genes did not display a desired dose response correlation associated with usable biomarkers, but did support responses within the suite of genes investigated, somewhat validating their use within a broader biomarker approach. Hemopexin for example is known to be involved in axon repair, and the myelin sheath surrounding the axon needs to be degraded for this repair to be processed, hypothesizing therefore that ASPA downregulation is resultant of neurological damage. The subsequent decrease of hemopexin expression at higher exposure concentrations, and further decrease in ASPA, may be indicative of repair impairments.",

We would hypothesize that induction of transcription of the genes encoding ASPA, hemopexin, parvalbumin and creatine kinase are part of a pathway of damage triggered repair mechanisms, responding to esfenvalerate insult. Reduction in expression of ASPA indicates that myelin sheaths may be degraded, resulting in a number of detrimental effects on the lesion sites, and similarly, muscular structure and function is being compromised as measured by alterations in titin and myozenin expression. The expression of \u03b2-microglobulins could be a compensatory reaction to toxic damage, protecting cells from infections in a susceptible immune system caused by exposure to esfenvalerate. Previous studies, carried out in esfenvalerate exposed chinook salmon have reported a compromised immunity and significantly higher susceptibility to infection [9, 63] . This is particularly important in younger organisms that are generally more susceptible than adults.

Damage to the olfactory system has been used as a sublethal toxicological endpoint in fish, in studies investigating behavior following pesticide exposures [88] . Pyrethroids are known to affect the olfactory system [89] . A chemosensory gene, ictacalcin, responding to esfenvalerate exposure was also differentially expressed on the microarray. Ictacalcin is a gene originally identified in catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), involved in chemosensory tissues, and highly expressed in barbell, olfactory mucosa and gill [90] . Differential expression of this gene may indicate that further behavioral parameters, not investigated in this study, such as recognition, alarm response, feeding, imprinting and homing, gamete release and synchronization, contaminant avoidance [88] , and other behavioral parameters that are governed by chemosensory system, could be compromised. We could speculate that outside laboratory conditions, neuromuscular and chemosensory impairments would probably result in higher ecological parameters being affected through inability to swim against water currents, making them more susceptible to predation and reducing their ability to obtain food. Furthermore, effects on chemosensory parameters would lead to migratory, reproductive, predator and contaminant avoidance impairments.",

The ability to use molecular biomarkers of neuromuscular effect further strengthens links between mechanistic effects with parameters of ecological relevance. Our study supports the use of gene expression as a productive way of understanding modes of actions of individual chemicals in endangered species. Furthermore, this screening and interrogative approach permits the identification and development of biomarkers for species of concern in which prior information is limited and allows for investigations into problems specific to the organism in question; assessing possible causes of detrimental effects and resulting influences on individual performance and hypothesizing effects upon population dynamics. A suite of biomarkers developed in this manner, though additions and subtractions are required from the presented list, could be used to aid monitor impacts of stressors upon organisms within a specific environment and could be an essential tool in determining causative factors of population decline in the delta smelt and other threatened species. The selected biomarkers clearly need to be further investigated and validated against other known contaminants, and suitability in field applications.",

In brief, print tip normalization was carried out within slides and sequential single slide data analysis was carried out as an alternative to between-slide normalization. An \u03b1-outliergenerating model was used to identify differentially expressed genes by applying the following decision rule for multiple-slide data analysis: a given gene was selected as a candidate if it was detected as significantly up-or downregulated in 4 of 4 replicates (raw p-value = 0.0625 using exact binomial test and considering outcomes as Bernoulli trials). The approach did not use scale estimator for statistical inference and, therefore, it did not require between-slide normalization. This method however, detected only one significant differentially expressed candidate gene at the highest exposure concentration (0.125 \u03bcg/L -1 ), (with no significant annotation identity -see results and discussion). As a result, a second analytical method was applied to increase the number of probable genes for consideration in biomarker development.
