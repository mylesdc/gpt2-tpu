Exacerbations are frequently due to extrinsic causes such as bacterial infections, viral infections, or noninfectious causes, such as medication noncompliance or environmental exposure [2, 3] . Antibiotics are not standard of care for asthma exacerbations, and several trials have shown no benefit to the use of macrolides for asthma exacerbations [4] [5] [6] [7] . Despite this, 22% of patients presenting to the emergency room and 58% of patients hospitalized for asthma receive antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-related adverse events, and additional costs [8, 9] . Antibacterials and antivirals are only effective in those with confirmed bacterial and influenza infections, respectively, but it is often difficult to identify these etiologies at the point of care [10, 11] .",

Patients were eligible for CAPSOD and CAPSS if they had a suspected acute respiratory illness and met at least two SIRS criteria. Subjects were also enrolled at Duke and the Durham VA Health Care System as part of RADICAL (Rapid Diagnostics in Categorizing Acute Lung Infection). RADICAL enrolled subjects with acute respiratory illness of suspected bacterial, viral, or noninfectious etiology. The objective of RADICAL was to develop a host response-based diagnostic assay to discriminate bacterial from viral infection. On enrollment, subject medical history, clinical data (including vital signs, laboratory values, and radiography results), and patient-reported symptom scores were recorded. Symptoms assessed included nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, throat discomfort, fever/chills, and headache. Scoring was based on the Jackson score using a zero to four scale (0: absent, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: very severe) [17] [18] [19] .

First, raw gene expression results were averaged normalized against two reference probes. Exploratory data analysis revealed differences between the two sample batches, which were corrected using an empirical Bayesian frameworks model [26, 27] . The normalized, batch-corrected data was used to fit a logistic regression model to perform both classification and target weight selection using the R package \"glmnet\" [28] . Specifically, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator for regularization and performed nested cross validation to select parameters. This resulted in three independent binary classifiers (bacterial versus non-bacterial, viral versus non-viral, and noninfectious versus infectious), which were combined into a single decision model using a one-versus-all scheme where the largest probability determines class membership. The fixed-weight model was then applied to the asthma exacerbation validation cohort to determine host-response classification. Since the asthma validation cohort was measured in an independent TLDA experiment, we included technical replicates in both training and validation TLDA experiments to evaluate and potentially correct for batch differences. In addition to this supervised analysis, we also performed dimensionality reduction on the asthmatic cohort to visualize the clustering of different groups based on infection status with respect to all 87 targets. The specific clustering algorithm utilized was T-distributed stochastic neighbor with a perplexity parameter of 10, which was implemented with the R package \"Rtsne\" [29] .

Notably, research-based supplemental PCR testing identified coronavirus and parainfluenza in two of these subjects, but this was not known at the time of clinical treatment. Antibiotic prescription during emergency room or hospital stay was recorded for each subject. Antibiotic prescription rate was calculated for the clinical adjudication groups and this was compared to the antibiotic prescription rate in the model-predicted groups.

We compared this approach to clinical adjudication and procalcitonin. Our results indicated that peripheral blood gene expression profiles may provide additional clinically useful information for distinguishing the major classes of asthma exacerbation triggers. In the acute care setting, such a task is challenging since asthma exacerbations often have similar presentations and existing diagnostics fail to identify an underlying cause in most. As a result, antibiotics are overprescribed-nearly half of the individuals in this study were given antibiotics, despite only a handful being adjudicated as having bacterial infection. This impacts antibiotic stewardship efforts as well as patient outcomes; a recent study reported longer admissions and higher cost of stay in asthmatics treated with antibiotics [31] . Gene expression approaches, once translated onto a clinically useful platform, could help abate empiric prescribing practices, mitigate antibiotic resistance, and improve patient care.",

Therefore, discordance between clinical adjudication and model classification may have arisen from errors in either classification scheme. Most of the discordant classifications involved the bacterial subgroup, for which there are several likely explanations. The seven individuals clinically identified as having bacterial infections had no supporting microbiology. Therefore, clinical adjudications were assigned based on symptoms, physical examination, laboratory testing, and radiography, all of which poorly discriminate bacterial and viral infections [43, 44] . Radiographic abnormalities, which were the most important factor for bacterial adjudication in this study, are frequently present in viral infections [45] [46] [47] [48] . Therefore, the subjects adjudicated as bacterial but classified as viral may have been true viral infections. There are other potential reasons for the observed discordance in bacterial vs. noninfectious diagnoses. The responses to bacterial and noninfectious inflammation have a large amount of biological overlap compared to the more specific interferon signaling in viral infections [16] . Consistent with this, we observed that the majority of discordance occurred between these two groups. In this scenario, a false negative bacterial infection diagnosis is of greatest concern due to the potentially missed opportunity to treat with antibiotics. Further iterations of the model will need to address rates of false negative bacterial diagnoses and the clinical cost of such errors.",

We attempted to augment the analysis using publicly available datasets, however, the available asthma exacerbation cohorts did not include bacterial, viral, and noninfectious etiologies. Due to technical differences between our RT-PCR experiments and those in the public domain (microarray or sequencing), our fixed weight model could not be applied; a new model would need to be trained. In order to do so, all three phenotypes must be present. Future directions include the development of an asthma exacerbation-specific signature in a larger, prospectively enrolled cohort, which could also incorporate clinical variables and procalcitonin into the model. Ideally, such a cohort would have supporting microbiological evidence to provide higher confidence in clinical adjudication and allow calculation of performance characteristics. Additionally, our enrollments focused on patients with acute respiratory illness or suspected sepsis. They did not focus exclusively on patients with asthma, which may have resulted in some bias compared to a dedicated, prospective asthma study. Additionally, there is some uncertainty in a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma in the electronic medical record, a common dilemma facing emergency medicine clinicians. Another limitation was the age of our cohort. Asthma exacerbations often occur in younger individuals, but our cohort was largely adult (though several pediatric subjects were included). However, the signatures used for this study were previously evaluated in both adult and pediatric patients, showing no significant difference based on age [16] . Nevertheless, assessing performance on younger subjects with asthma, and more generally understanding the impact of age on genomic measures of the host response, is an important next step that we are currently undertaking.",

Gene expression data from 48 bacterial (B), 54 viral (V), and 49 noninfectious (N) microbiologically confirmed cases were used to train classifiers capable of distinguishing between bacterial, viral, and noninfectious causes of illness. Specifically, the model created 3 separate classifiers: bacterial versus non-bacterial, viral versus non-viral, and infectious versus non-infectious. The fixed-weight classifiers were then applied to a cohort of patients with acute asthma exacerbations of various etiologies to predict the underlying trigger of the exacerbation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214871.g001 Gene expression approach for distinguishing asthma triggers PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214871 April 8, 2019",
