            "text": "Given the high burden of RSV disease in both humans and animals, development of a safe and effective vaccine is a critical goal. Importantly, however, a vaccine is only half of the equation and the status of the host immune system has a profound impact on vaccine efficacy, and ultimately, disease susceptibility. Understanding the factors that may negatively affect the efficacy of vaccines in target populations is also vital for an effective immunization program. VAD is endemic in the geographical regions which are hit hardest by RSV 1 , and is also highly prevalent in premature infants, a population known to be at increased risk from RSV 7, 8 . Epidemiologically, there is significant correlation between VAD and increased susceptibility to and severity of RSV infection 35, 36 ; however, the impact of the deficiency on mucosal immune function has not been explored in this context experimentally. To this end, we generated a calf model of VAD, assessed the immune response to mucosal BRSV-NP vaccination and subsequent BRSV challenge, and compared the responses to VA sufficient (VAS) calves. Here, we report that while VAS, BRSV-NP immunized calves are protected from severe RSV-associated disease, VAD calves fail to respond to intranasal BRSV-NP vaccination and develop severe BRSV-associated disease. VAD, BRSV-NP immunized calves do not mount an IgA response in the respiratory tract, nor do they generate virus-specific T cell responses in the lungs or peripheral blood. Gene expression studies demonstrated that VAD calves present with significant abnormalities in the inflammatory milieu in the infected lung, with alterations in Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and impaired mucin production. We further show that acute respiratory viral infection has a significant negative impact on circulating and stored VA levels, causing even vitamin-replete calves to become VA deficient. Thus, our results show that VA status has a significant impact on the mucosal immune system and resistance to respiratory viral infection.",

Calves are born with low VA levels and colostrum is a major source of VA and other fat-soluble micronutrients 37 . Therefore, all calves received fractionated colostrum replacer with or without VA restored, and were placed on a VAS or VAD milk replacer diet. Serum retinol levels were evaluated weekly, starting after calves were on the differential diets for 1 week. As shown in Fig. 1A , all animals had low serum retinol levels at week 1, but these levels increased in the VAS group, reaching normal serum retinol concentrations by 5-6 weeks of age. The normal range for serum retinol in juvenile calves (30-300 days) is 0.25-0.33 ppm 38 . Plasma VA levels are tightly regulated by the liver, and therefore not optimal for determining VA status. To confirm VA status in our two treatment groups, liver samples were collected at the time of necropsy. The normal range for liver retinol in juvenile calves is 75-130 ppm 38 . As seen in Fig. 1B , calves in the VAD treatment group had below normal retinol stores in the liver at the time of necropsy, while VAS calves had normal liver stores.",

To determine the impact of VAD on the response to intranasal vaccination, 13 calves from the VAS treatment group and 12 calves from the VAD treatment group were immunized with the BRSV-NP vaccine. In prior studies, inclusion of soluble antigen with CPTEG:CPH NP-encapsulated protein has been used to induce rapid immunogenicity of the nanovaccines 29, 39 . Therefore, in this study we also sought to determine whether inclusion of soluble F/G protein improves the efficacy of the BRSV-NP vaccine. Calves were immunized intranasally with a single dose of 145 mg BRSV-F/G NP (encapsulating ~1 mg each of the BRSV F and G proteins), co-administered with 1 mg each of soluble F and G proteins in 5 mL of sterile saline. Six VAS calves and six VAD calves served as unvaccinated controls. Four weeks after immunization, calves were challenged via aerosol inoculation with ~10 4 TCID 50 BRSV strain 375. Calves were monitored daily for clinical signs, including body temperature, appetite, nasal discharge and respiratory effort. Starting on days 4-5 after infection, animals developed fevers and clinical signs of lower respiratory tract disease, including coughing, increased respiration rates and increased respiratory effort. As seen in Fig. 2A , on day 7 post infection, clinical disease was significantly reduced in VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves compared to VAS/unvaccinated animals and compared to VAD/ BRSV-NP vaccinated calves. There were no significant differences in the clinical signs observed between VAS/ unvaccinated controls, VAD/unvaccinated controls and VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves.",

Surprisingly, however, VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves were not protected by vaccination and developed lung lesions that were similar to the unvaccinated control calves (Fig. 2B,C) . Samples of affected and unaffected lung tissue from each animal were evaluated for microscopic lesions using the histopathology scoring system we have previously described 34 . The lesions were consistent with experimental BRSV infection 27, 34, 40 with bronchointerstitial pneumonia and necrotizing bronchiolitis. As seen in Fig. 2D , VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves showed significantly reduced histological lesions compared to VAS/ unvaccinated calves and VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves. No differences were observed between VAD/unvaccinated and VAD/BRSV-NP vaccinated calves.",

In rodents challenged with endotoxin, retinol is transiently sequestered in the liver and other tissues, but reappears in the plasma shortly after, with no appreciable irreversible retinol loss 44 . In human patients, however, acute illness has been linked to increased VA deficiency 43 . Observationally, respiratory infections in particular have been implicated in depletion of liver VA stores in children 45 ; however, to our knowledge, there have been no studies to date investigating the impact of RSV infection on VA levels in nutritionally-replete infants. Given the potential link between acute infection and VA status, we more closely examined retinol levels in the VAS animals undergoing acute viral infection. Serum samples were collected from VAS/BRSV-NP vaccinated and VAS/unvaccinated calves on days 0, 2, 4 and 6 post infection and were analyzed for serum retinol. As seen in Fig. 7 , consistent with reports of hyporetinemia in other species, serum VA levels declined in VAS/unvaccinated calves during acute BRSV infection. In contrast, VA levels were maintained in VAS/BRSV-NP immunized calves, which were undergoing a significantly reduced clinical disease ( Fig. 2A) . When liver VA levels from VAS calves (Fig. 1B) were further analyzed based on vaccination status, we observed that unvaccinated calves had reduced liver VA levels compared to the vaccinated cohort (Fig. 7B) . In fact, the mean liver retinol levels fell below the accepted normal range for animals of this age 38 , rendering them VA deficient, despite their VA replete diet. We also analyzed liver retinol data from all VAS calves The RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. The RNA from multiple sites was then pooled and was analyzed by qPCR for the BRSV NS2 gene. Viral NS2 copy numbers were calculated using standard curves and normalized to the housekeeping gene, S9, to correct for differences in input material.

VAD is endemic in the geographical regions which are hit hardest by RSV 1 , and is also a significant problem in premature infants in both developing and developed countries 7, 8 . Also concerning, while VAD is thought to be a disease of the developing world, some studies have suggested that subclinical VAD may be quite prevalent 1, 4, 5, 46 . It is critical to identify and address comorbidities and host factors which have potential to undermine the effectiveness of a vaccine, such as VAD, in target populations. Here, in the calf model of BRSV infection, we show that VAD has a profound negative impact on the capacity of the host to respond to an intranasal, polyanhydride NP vaccine and to resist the subsequent viral challenge. VAD calves have altered inflammatory cytokine profiles in the lungs, and do not produce virus-specific IgA or cellular immune responses in the lungs or peripheral blood.

This result is consistent with a previous report by Penkert et al. in a mouse model of Sendai virus (SeV) infection 41 , where levels of IL-6, CXCL10, IFN\u03b3 and RANTES were increased in nasal washes from VAD, infected animals. In this model, similar to ours, VAD mice fail to produce virus-specific IgA and have reduced frequencies of CD8 T cells in the lungs following infection 42 . RA promotes the development of FoxP3 + regulatory T cells, while inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation 47 . The dysregulated hyper-inflammatory phenotype that has been observed in some models of VAD has been attributed to deficiencies in FoxP3 + Treg cells 48 there is no defect in Treg cell differentiation in SeV-infected mice 41 . Given the reciprocal relationship between Treg and Th17 cells in the presence of RA 47 , one would predict increased Th17 development and increased IL-17 expression in a VAD system, thus explaining the altered inflammatory profile. However, this is not consistent with our findings in the lungs of VAD calves, as we observed significantly reduced expression of IL-17. Similarly, IL-17 was not detected in the nasal washes of VAD animals during SeV infection 41 7), the authors observe no difference in the viral titers between VAS and VAD animals 42 ; however, on day 10 after infection, VAS animals had significantly reduced viral loads compared to VAD animals 41 . The authors speculate that antigen persistence and defects in viral clearance mechanisms contribute to the heightened inflammation in the lungs of the VAD animals, rather than defects in Tregs or Th17 skewing. We detected no differences in virus shedding or viral load between VAD or VAS calves on day 7 after infection. In future studies, it will be important to determine if VAD calves display similar defects in viral clearance in the later stages of the disease, thus explaining the dysregulated cytokine production we observed in the lungs, or if instead, this defect may be attributed to other mechanisms during RSV infection such as an imbalance in the Treg/Th17 axis. Importantly, we observed no significant differences in IL-10 expression in the lungs of VAD calves compared to VAS controls, suggesting that the Treg response may be intact in these animals. However, we did observe increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 in the lungs of our VAD calves. While TGF-\u03b2 expression can play a regulatory role, it is also an important cytokine that is elevated during during tissue repair and can contribute to lung fibrosis and mucin expression 50 . Further investigation into the impact of VAD on the respiratory immune system and response to RSV infection is warranted.",

Measles, chickenpox, respiratory infections and diarrhea have all been implicated in the depletion of liver VA stores and increased risk of xerophthalmia, the principal clinical manifestation of VA deficiency 45, 51 . However, there have been relatively few studies that have specifically addressed the impact of acute respiratory viral infection on retinol status in vitamin replete individuals. As we observed, serum retinol declines over the course of a severe BRSV infection. This result is not surprising, as serum VA is regulated during the acute phase response. In VA-adequate rats, serum retinol declines rapidly following LPS or IL-6 challenge, but returns to normal levels during the resolution phase of the response 44,52 . There is a minimal loss of retinol through the urine, and studies of radiolabeled retinol have revealed that the majority of retinol is redistributed in the liver and tissues during www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ infection and returns to circulation 53 . However, contrary to these reports and consistent with the epidemiologic data from humans, our own data suggests that acute infection causes an overall loss in liver stores. In our studies, it is not clear if retinol stores are consumed during the inflammatory response or excreted during the illness. However, the severe impact of acute viral infection on VA stores is cause for concern, as there is potential to fall into a 'vicious circle' of acute illness, deficiency and susceptibility to secondary infection.",

VA supplementation has a significant positive impact on incidence of measles [54] [55] [56] . However, its effects on other diseases are less clear. Some studies have reported significant reductions, while others have found little effect or even increased incidence and severity of diarrhea and respiratory infections in children receiving vitamin A supplementation 36, [57] [58] [59] [60] . Studies specifically examining the impact of oral VA supplementation during RSV infection have shown no effect 36, 57, 61 or in one study, have observed increased length of hospital stay for infants receiving VA 58 . We speculate that oral supplementation at the time of vaccination may not be ideal for addressing VAD and its effects on the respiratory immune response, primarily due to kinetics. A similar principle applies to supplementation during acute infection. Changes in VA homeostasis due to acute inflammation likely limits VA access to inflamed tissues and prevents any modulation to the ongoing immune response. Thus, in the future, we are interested in investigating the utility of a mucosal VA supplementation strategy, which may be a more efficient approach to addressing the immunologic lesions observed in VAD individuals during respiratory vaccination or infection.",

Calves were randomly assigned to the VAD or VAS treatment group. All calves were prevented suckling from their dams, and instead received a first feeding of colostrum replacer within 4 h of birth. Each animal received 375 g of fractionated colostrum replacer (Milk Products, Chilton, WI) reconstituted in 1.9 L of water at approximately 40 \u00b0C.
