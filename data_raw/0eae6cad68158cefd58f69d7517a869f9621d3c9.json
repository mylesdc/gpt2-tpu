Prospective AFI studies provide a methodology to describe the syndrome by age and etiology, findings that can be used to develop case definitions and multiplexed diagnostics to optimize management. We conducted a 3year prospective AFI study in Puerto Rico. Patients with fever 7 days were offered enrollment, and clinical data and specimens were collected at enrollment and upon discharge or follow-up. Blood and oro-nasopharyngeal specimens were tested by RT-PCR and immunodiagnostic methods for infection with dengue viruses (DENV) 1-4, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), influenza A and B viruses (FLU A/B), 12 other respiratory viruses (ORV), enterovirus, Leptospira spp., and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Clinical presentation and laboratory findings of participants infected with DENV were compared to those infected with CHIKV, FLU A/B, and ORV. Clinical predictors of laboratory-positive dengue compared to all other AFI etiologies were determined by age and day post-illness onset (DPO) at presentation. Of 8,996 participants enrolled from May 7, 2012 through May 6, 2015, more than half (54.8%, 4,930) had a pathogen detected. Pathogens most frequently detected were CHIKV (1,635, 18.2%), FLU A/B (1,074, 11.9%), DENV 1-4 (970, 10.8%), and ORV (904, 10.3%).",

Knowledge is limited in this area, in large part because AFIs often have similar non-specific clinical presentations early in the clinical course when most patients are likely to present for care. In addition, rapid point-of-care diagnostics are often not readily available. Surveillance for AFIs, if done, is largely passive and relies on clinical identification of cases and voluntary case reporting. Therefore, burden of disease for the etiologic agents of AFI are likely underestimated. An improved understanding of the major causes of AFI is important to guide clinical management, develop diagnostics, inform public health policy, and direct prevention efforts [3] .",

In the last four decades, dengue, a mosquito-borne AFI caused by four genetically distinct dengue viruses (DENV 1-4), has become an increasingly common cause of AFI [4, 5] . The burden of dengue is thought to be less in Latin America than in Southeast Asia [6] ; however, several studies have found that the incidence of dengue is likely underestimated in Latin America due to reliance on passive case surveillance [6] [7] [8] . Understanding region-specific etiologies of AFI and estimating the true incidence of dengue is necessary to plan large scale interventional trials for assessing the impact of mosquito control measures and vaccines. In addition, collecting clinical signs and symptoms from AFI patients of all ages with identified etiologic agents has utility in developing unbiased case definitions and identifying early clinical predictors to guide clinical management.",

While these studies are comparable in many ways, the studies differ in that several excluded either infants and young children [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 16] , older adults [12, 13] , severe or hospitalized cases [13, 16] , or cases with a known source of fever [9] [10] [11] [12] 14] . In addition, most studies were conducted in low resource settings in Southeast Asia where malaria is still endemic [9, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In fact, two studies enrolled based on a potential participant meeting national eligibility criteria for malaria testing [12, 13] , and two other studies excluded cases based on malaria blood smear positivity [14, 15] .",

To identify predictors of laboratory-positive dengue as compared to all other AFI cases, stepwise Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) variable selection was used for each imputed data set. Variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled logistic regression model [34] . Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant early (<3 DPO) and late (3) (4) (5) predictors.

Participants with ORV illness were significantly younger (median age = 3.2 years, p <0.001) than participants with dengue (15.4 years), chikungunya (24.3 years), or influenza (14.1 years). In contrast, the median age of participants with chikungunya was significantly greater than participants in all other diagnostic groups, and they were more likely to report having a chronic medical condition. A higher proportion of participants with dengue reported having a household member with dengue at enrollment than participants with other diagnoses (11.8% of dengue cases versus 5% in other diagnostic groups, p <0.001). Over half of all participants reported having mosquito bites in the 30 days before enrollment; however, a higher proportion of participants with chikungunya reported mosquito bites than participants with other laboratory diagnoses (73.9% versus <55% in other diagnostic groups, p<0.001). Clinical presentation and disposition varied by laboratory diagnostic group (Table 4) . Participants with laboratory-positive dengue presented later (median = 3 days), and a higher proportion were admitted at enrollment than participants with other laboratory diagnoses; nearly half (46.6%) of dengue cases were admitted compared with 27.3% of participants with ORV illness, 18.8% with influenza, and 11.2% with chikungunya. A significantly higher proportion of participants with dengue had chills, signs of poor circulation, eye pain, headache, dizziness, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea at enrollment than participants with influenza, ORV illness or chikungunya. A higher proportion of participants with dengue versus these other diagnoses had thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Compared to influenza and ORV illness cases, a significantly higher proportion of dengue cases had a skin rash, pruritic skin, any bleeding, a skin bleed, and muscle, bone, back, and joint pain, whereas a higher proportion of chikungunya versus dengue cases had these findings. A higher proportion of dengue versus influenza and ORV illness cases had facial and/or neck erythema and mucosal bleeding. In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of participants with influenza and ORV illness than dengue had cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat.",

            "text": "As a clinical syndrome, AFIs are a diagnostic challenge for clinicians especially early in the clinical course when anticipatory guidance and supportive care may pre-empt medical complications. Our study identified the AFI etiology in over half (55%) of participants and most were infected with one of nine viral pathogens. This detection frequency was higher than that of other recent prospective AFI studies that tested for multiple pathogens (55% versus 36-41%) [9] [10] [11] [12] 15] . This difference may in part be explained by the greater contribution of chikungunya in our study than in the other studies that tested for this pathogen [9, 10, 17] . However, unlike other studies, we were unable to detect any evidence of disease caused by Rickettsia or Coxiella spp., which made up 4-13% of all AFIs in other studies [10] [11] [12] [13] ; and unlike other areas, malaria [9, [11] [12] [13] 18] and typhoid fever [9, 10, 12, 13, 15] were not part of our diagnostic algorithm as they are only occasionally detected among travelers returning to Puerto Rico. While DENV was not as commonly identified as CHIKV or FLU A/B, participants with dengue were more likely to be admitted to the hospital at enrollment. The proportion of AFI cases with dengue in our study was comparable to other recent studies which found 4-9% of AFI cases had dengue [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] . One exception to this was a study that found 34% of AFI patients had dengue; however, the study's eligibility criteria likely enhanced enrollment of dengue cases [14] . In our study, dengue incidence varied by age group with a nearly a 10-fold difference between participants <5 years old and 10-19 years old (3% versus 27%), which may be due to differences in likelihood of seeking medical care in primary versus secondary DENV infections [35] . Of note, 6% of participants !65 years old had dengue as a cause of AFI, a finding comparable to a Puerto Rico study in which 5% of 17,666 laboratory-positive dengue cases detected by surveillance were !65 years old [36] . In contrast, other recent prospective studies Chikungunya, the most commonly identified AFI overall, was least likely to result in hospital admission, although two male participants with CHIKV infection died. These cases were older individuals (>75 years old) who had underlying co-morbidities which may have complicated their clinical course. Nonetheless, since autopsy was not performed for either case, ascertaining whether CHIKV infection played a role in either fatality is difficult. However, in our study chikungunya was disproportionally identified among older participants, with positivity increasing from <10% of pre-school aged children to about one-third of participants !50 years old. This pattern of disease has been seen in other areas with recent CHIKV emergence [18] , and may be due to older individuals having an increased likelihood of complications due to preexisting co-morbidities [44, 45] .",

            "text": "Co-infections confirmed by molecular assays were detected among 1% of our participants, most commonly involving enteroviral or ORV infections; less than one-third of all co-infections included a DENV or CHIKV infection. Another recent prospective study found that 1% of AFI participants had co-infections involving molecularly diagnosed dengue or influenza, malaria, and positive blood culture [9] . Interestingly, we did not detect any co-infections involving CHIKV and DENV. An analysis of island-wide surveillance data from Puerto Rico during the same time period found only one CHIKV/DENV co-infection among approximately 1,000 specimens tested by RT-PCR for both DENV and CHIKV [46] . These findings are consistent with another prospective AFI study conducted in Sri Lanka [17] . Although a recent study has shown that Aedes aegypti can be infected with as many as three arboviruses simultaneously and can likely transmit these viruses to humans [47] , the frequency of co-or tri-infection of mosquitoes in the wild depends upon the geographic spread and degree of circulation of each virus. During our study, DENV transmission decreased significantly before CHIKV transmission peaked, making co-infections less likely. In addition, in Puerto Rico, where Aedes aegypti is the sole vector for CHIKV and DENV, viral interaction and viral Prospective study of acute febrile illness in Puerto Rico interference within the mosquito may reduce the likelihood of co-infection [48] [49] [50] . However, RT-PCR positive DENV/CHIKV co-infections have been documented at higher rates in five countries [51] . We identified differences in clinical predictors of laboratory-positive dengue by timing of presentation and age group highlighting the importance of considering these factors when developing prediction algorithms for clinical management [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . We found, as have others [61] , that even early (<3 DPO) in the clinical course leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are predictive of dengue across all age groups, and thrombocytopenia strengthened as a predictor over time. In our study, headache and eye pain were the only \"aches and pains\" that were predictive of dengue for all age groups [62] . Eye pain was a predictor early and later in the clinical course, a finding consistent with pediatric [63] and adult [56] prospective cohort studies, as well as a surveillance study conducted in Puerto Rico [52] . We also found that rash among children <5 years old presenting early and erythema on the face and/or neck in all age groups presenting 3-5 DPO, were positive predictors of dengue. While the presence of skin rash has been found to be a predictor of dengue in several prospective studies [61] , few studies have evaluated erythema as a predictor [18, 64, 65] . Last, like other prospective studies [56, 66] , we found that nausea is an early predictor for dengue. We were also able to show that adults aged 20-49 years presenting 3-5 DPO were more likely to have abdominal pain than those with other AFIs, and dengue cases of all ages presenting 3-5 DPO were also more likely to have diarrhea and poor circulation in addition to nausea, findings that lend support to the idea that warning signs for severe dengue develop after the early phase of the illness.",

The study was conducted in southern Puerto Rico which may differ from neighboring islands and other parts of the island with regard to population demographics, preexisting immunity to DENV and other flaviviruses, and exposure to infections. Second, while we enrolled nearly 600 older adults (!65 years old), we were unable to adequately evaluate predictors of dengue among this population because we had only 36 dengue cases and most presented early in the clinical course. Last, we did not systematically collect stool and test for potential enteric pathogens, and bacterial infections were likely under recognized because blood cultures were only done on patients in whom sepsis was suspected.",

In fact, we were unable to find any cases of Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Coxiella spp., and only sporadic cases of melioidosis and leptospirosis were identified. Our findings demonstrate that dengue is not only one of the leading causes of AFI in Puerto Rico, but results in greater morbidity than other AFIs as measured by need for hospitalization. Moreover, dengue affects people of all ages including older adults who may be at higher risk of developing medical complications. Clinicians should include dengue on the differential diagnosis of AFI among older adults so that timely anticipatory guidance can be offered. We found that the presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were the best predictors of dengue in both time periods overall and for all age groups. Our findings suggest that eye pain should be reevaluated as a predictor of dengue. Future studies should focus on improving clinical diagnosis of AFI including dengue by timing of presentation and age of the patient.",
