In order to shed more light on these processes, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry were used to determine the proteome response of the HeLa cell line to persistent LCMV infection. Quantitative analysis revealed 24 differentially abundant proteins. Functional analysis showed that LCMV-responsive proteins were primarily involved in metabolism, stress, and the defense response. Among identified proteins, we discovered significant changes for peroxiredoxins, a family of antioxidant enzymes. Decreased amount of these antioxidant proteins correlated with elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected cells. Increased levels of ROS were accompanied by changes in the pattern of telomere restriction fragments (TRFs) in infected cells and mediated activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) and phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Moreover, treatment with antioxidants resulted in reduced levels of viral nucleoprotein, indicating a connection between ROS-dependent signaling and viral replication.",

Studies using this viral model have resulted in significant progress in virology and immunology that is applicable to other human microbial and viral infections (Oldstone, 2002; Zinkernagel, 2002) . In addition, LCMV is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance that may lead to severe disease and consequences after prenatal infection (Barton and Mets, 1999; Mets et al., 2000; Barton et al., 2002) , and life-threatening conditions in immunosuppressed individuals (Fischer et al., 2006; Palacios et al., 2008; Macneil et al., 2011) . Moreover, several mammarenaviruses, such as the Lassa, Junin, and Machupo viruses, are associated with severe hemorrhagic fever disease with significant morbidity and mortality in humans, representing serious public health concerns in their endemic regions (Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004; Buchmeier et al., 2007) . Currently, supportive care and ribavirin (nucleoside analogue) are the only treatment options available (Damonte and Coto, 2002; Parker, 2005) . Therefore, considerable interest focuses on the development of therapeutic strategies against mammarenavirus infection and disease. Understanding how viruses and the hosts interact and how their interactions change over time would help in the rational design of targeting compounds.",

The S segment of the genome encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) that encapsidates viral RNA and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC). After post-translational modification, GPC yields GP1 and GP2 that mediate virus entry. The L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) responsible for viral RNA synthesis, and the zincbinding protein (Z) important for viral budding (Buchmeier et al., 2007) . Mammarenaviruses are able to establish persistent infection in their natural hosts and in a number of mammalian cells in vitro. During persistence, mammarenaviruses continue to replicate and express viral proteins. At the same time, they interfere with normal host homeostasis, resulting in possible disease without the destruction of the infected cell. Additionally, they actively suppress the host's immune response in order to avoid recognition and to allow the spread of infection (Oldstone, 2006) . Although research on LCMV has led to many insights into viral persistence, the answers to several crucial questions related to the principles, by which persistence is initiated and maintained, are still lacking.",

So far, several large-scale analyses of host proteome (Bowick et al., 2006 (Bowick et al., , 2009 (Bowick et al., , 2010 , kinome (Bowick et al., 2007) , and transcriptome (Djavani et al., 2007 (Djavani et al., , 2009 Muller et al., 2007) have been performed to study the consequences of an acute mammarenavirus infection.

Our data reveal significant changes in the proteins associated with metabolism, antioxidant activity, protein folding, RNA binding, and immune response. Many of the differentially abundant proteins have not been reported previously as virus-responsive upon LCMV infection. Thus, these proteins represent potential targets for further in-depth investigations. Understanding their roles in persistent LCMV infection would reveal more about the complexity and dynamics of interactions between virus and host cells, and would benefit antiviral research. This study thus offers useful basis for further research into the function of human proteins in persistent infection.",

Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are members of an ubiquitous family of thiol-specific peroxidases that reduce mainly hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to water with the use of reducing equivalents provided through the thioredoxin system (Wood et al., 2003) . To confirm the alteration in the abundance of peroxiredoxins during LCMV infection, we selected the most affected PRDX4 for Western blot analysis. Figure 5A shows an almost identical decrease in the expression of PRDX4 (\u22122.05) in infected cells as we observed in the 2D-DIGE analysis (\u22122.08). Since one of the major functions of Prxs is cellular protection against oxidative stress, we hypothesized that decreased levels of these antioxidant proteins may lead to an elevation of the ROS content in infected cells. The measurement of ROS generation in mock-and LCMV-infected cells supported our prediction. We revealed significantly higher production of ROS (1.76-fold) in LCMV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells ( Figure 5B) . Interestingly, another antioxidant enzyme, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), was more abundant in infected cells (Table 1 ), yet this seems to be insufficient to counterbalance the decrease in the levels of peroxiredoxins.",

The use of HeLa-MX cells has several advantages, such as the feasibility of use of a large number of cells for proteomic analysis, reproducibility, and viral persistence resembling a life-long chronic infection. However, in terms of natural LCMV infection, HeLa cells possess some limitations and one needs to be cautious about generalizing the results. Therefore, we performed some of the experiments also on the A549 cell line, a model of type II alveolar epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure S2) . This cell type is the first to be in contact with the virus during primary infection. It has also been shown that A549 cells are capable of antigen presentation (Salik et al., 1999) .

In addition, functional enrichment analysis, as well as network analysis, pointed out that the antioxidant system was in the center of virusinduced host proteome response (Figure 3) . The key functions of Prxs include cellular protection against oxidative stress and modulation of signaling pathways that use hydrogen peroxide as a second messenger (Rhee et al., 2005a,b) . A significant amount of published data suggests that Prxs are hydrogen peroxide sensors that play a central role in redox signaling (Rhee et al., 2012; Latimer and Veal, 2016; Netto and Antunes, 2016) . This is implicated in a number of biological processes, including growth factor signaling, cell differentiation, and cytokine production (Hampton and O'Connor, 2016) . Regulation of Prxs modifies the concentration of H 2 O 2 and thereby facilitates its signaling functions. We indeed confirmed a slight but significant elevation of the ROS content alongside the downregulation of Prxs by LCMV both in HeLa and A549 cells (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S2A) .",

            "text": "ROS, in the form of H 2 O 2 , can modify protein function, and/or structure through the mechanism of cysteine oxidation that influences a number of signaling cascades. For example, ROS activate PI3K either directly or by inactivating the phosphatase PTEN via oxidizing cysteine residues within its active site, resulting in an increased activation of Akt and modulation of its downstream targets (Lee et al., 2002; Connor et al., 2005) . Once activated, Akt promotes cell survival, growth, metabolism, and proliferation by phosphorylating various effectors (Ersahin et al., 2015) . In line with these findings, we observed enhanced levels of active Akt in LCMV-infected cells. In addition, inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl cysteine led to suppressed phosphorylation of Akt in infected cells, suggesting that Akt becomes activated in a ROS-dependent manner (Figures 7B,C) . Notably, the treatment with antioxidants also resulted in reduced levels of viral NP in HeLa, as well as in A549 LCMV-infected cells, suggesting a link between ROS-dependent signaling and virus replication (Figures 7B,D and Supplementary Figure S2B ). These findings are in accordance with previous studies that have demonstrated that ROS generated in response to LCMV play an important role in virus binding and subsequent virus replication (Michalek et al., 2008) . Moreover, it has been shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in different steps of the life cycle of a variety of viruses. For instance, infection with the New World mammarenavirus Junin virus has been shown to induce the PI3K/Akt pathway, and inhibition of this pathway has resulted in a decreased infectious virus yield because of blocking the recycling of the transferrin receptor engaged in JUNV cell entry (Linero and Scolaro, 2009) . Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition reduced budding and, to a lower degree, LCMV RNA synthesis, but not cell entry (Urata et al., 2012) . Additionally, the SARS coronavirus induced weak activation of Akt that was crucial for the establishment of persistence (Mizutani et al., 2005) . In contrast, PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition could not interfere with the establishment of persistent JUNV infection in Vero cells, and this pathway was not crucial for the maintenance of JUNV persistence (Linero and Scolaro, 2009 ).

HIF-1 is the main hypoxiainducible transcription factor responsible for cell and tissue adaptation to low oxygen, by controlling cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, erythropoiesis and angiogenesis (Semenza, 2003) . There is increasing evidence demonstrating that non-hypoxic stimuli can also activate HIF-1. It has been shown that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade directly increases the expression of HIF-1 encoding gene on the transcriptional and translational levels (Dery et al., 2005) . Any aberrant stimulation of this pathway leads to activation of HIF-1\u03b1, even in normoxic conditions. An increased ROS production has been reported as essential for increased HIF translation through the PI3K pathway (Iommarini et al., 2017) and for HIF stabilization through the inactivation of prolyl hydroxylases in a nonhypoxic system (Diebold and Chandel, 2016) . Accordingly, we demonstrated enhanced HIF-1 transactivation in LCMV-infected cells (Figure 7A) , as well as increased expression of ENO1 (Figure 4) , a typical HIF-1 target gene (Semenza et al., 1996) . Interestingly, HSP90B1 expression was reduced by persistent LCMV (Figure 4) , which has also been previously reported in the case of hypoxia in MIN6 cells (Bensellam et al., 2016) . PI3K/Akt signaling, as well as the HIF transcription factors, have in common that they play an essential role in regulating cellular metabolism (Dery et al., 2005; Yu and Cui, 2016) . In view of that, we observed that a large number of proteins identified in this study, such as the above mentioned alphaenolase or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, are involved in metabolism, as indicated by the GO analysis (Figure 2) .",

The thioredoxin (Trx) system consisting of NADPH, TrxR, and thioredoxin, is a key antioxidant mechanism in protection against oxidative stress. It regulates protein dithiol/disulfide balance through its disulfide reductase activity (Arner, 2009) . As already mentioned, Trx provides electrons to peroxiredoxins to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Trx reductase then reduces oxidized Trx back using the reducing NADPH equivalents. Thus, Trx reductase plays a crucial role in regeneration of a catalytically active form of Prxs (Lu and Holmgren, 2014) . We can, therefore, speculate that elevated levels of TrxR1 can maintain proper accumulation of local H 2 O 2 to ensure that it acts as a signaling molecule and does not cause oxidative damage. Based on the abovementioned facts, it is possible that LCMV modulates the delicate interplay inside cells between oxidants and antioxidants, and determines the activity profile for a variety of proteins that maintain persistent infection (such as transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal proteins, or metabolic enzymes).",

Telomeres, the nucleo-protein complexes at the chromosomal ends, are essential parts of the genome providing solutions to both end-protection and endreplication problems (Shay and Wright, 2019) . The solution to end-protection problem is provided by a specialized protein complex called shelterin (de Lange, 2010) , in combination with the formation of a secondary structure called the telomeric loop (Griffith et al., 1999) . The end-replication problem is solved by various means. In human germ or stem cells, and most cancer cells (including HeLa), telomeres are preserved by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase using an RNA subunit as a template for extension of an array of 5 -TTAGGG-3 repeats (Shay and Wright, 2019) . Guanine residues in telomeric repeats are particularly susceptible to oxidation resulting in their conversion to 8-oxoG (Oikawa and Kawanishi, 1999) . Accumulation of this oxidized purine compromises the telomere maintenance system in a quite complex way, including inhibition of binding of the shelterin components TRF1 and TRF2, the formation of t-loop, and/or the inhibition of telomerase (Ahmed and Lingner, 2018) . Thus, increased intracellular levels of ROS often result in telomere shortening (von Zglinicki, 2002) , as observed in this study in the case of HeLa cells infected by LCMV (Figure 6 ). Furthermore, it was shown previously by the Lingner group that telomeres physically interact with PRDX1 and PRDX2 (Aeby et al., 2016) . Although the levels of PRDX1 were not substantially affected in HeLa-MX cells (data not shown), PRDX2 exhibited a 1.5-fold decrease ( Table 1) . As PRDX2 was shown to interact with telomeres in the S phase of the cell cycle (Aeby et al., 2016) , reduction in its amount in HeLa cells infected by LCMV may contribute to a detrimental effect of ROS on the maintenance of their telomeric repeats.",

This study analyzed proteomic changes in a human cell line upon persistent infection with LCMV using quantitative gelbased proteomics. We identified 24 modulated host proteins, which play important roles in a number of cellular processes. Uncovering their roles in persistent LCMV infection can broaden our understanding of the complex and dynamic virus-host cell interactions and be valuable for antiviral research. We provided experimental evidence that LCMV negatively affects the levels of antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins leading to elevated intracellular content of ROS. These changes were accompanied by activation of HIF-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as changes in the profile of telomeric restriction fragments. The treatment with antioxidants resulted in reduced level of viral nucleoprotein, indicating that virus replication and ROSdependent signaling are interconnected processes.",

A 50 \u00b5g of each sample were labeled with 400 pmol of either Cy3 or Cy5 dye. Preferential binding of the dyes was evaluated using dye-swap technique between individual replicates of the analytical gel. In panels (A,C) the HeLa protein sample was labeled with Cy3 dye (green channel) while Cy5 labeling (red channel) was used for the HeLa-MX. Panel (B) represents replicate gel No. 2 where the HeLa sample was labeled with Cy5 and the HeLa-MX was labeled with Cy3. Intra-and inter-gel variations were normalized according to the internal standard consisting of all analyzed samples in ratio 1:1 labeled with Cy2 dye. Once normalized, these analytical 2D gels were used to analyze the differential abundance of proteins between HeLa and Hela-MX samples.",
