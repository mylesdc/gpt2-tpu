Examination of the interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkey would significantly contribute to revealing the gut microbiome composition. Methods: Here, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail, and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome. The depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real-time PCR. We also detected changes in the gut metabolome by GC-MS and LC-MS.",

Furthermore, the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) decreased from 104.47 to 33.84, and the abundance of eukaryotic viruses also changed substantially. In the annotation, 6 families of DNA viruses and 1 bacteriophage family were present in the normal monkeys but absent after gut bacterial microbiome depletion. Intriguingly, we discovered that changes in the gut bacterial microbiome composition may promote changes in the gut virome composition, and tryptophan, arginine, and quinone may play roles in the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and virome. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the clearly altered composition of the virome was correlated with depletion in the bacterial community and that metabolites produced by bacteria possibly play important roles in the interaction.",

This intricate ecosystem interacts with the adjacent epithelial layer, and the microbes perform metabolic functions, protect against pathogens, and condition the immune system, and through these basic functions, these microbes directly or indirectly affect most of the physiological functions of the host [1, 2] . In recent years, variations in the bacterial community composition have been shown to correlate with infection outcome, inflammatory bowel disease [3] , diabetes [4] , obesity [5] , and depression [6] , and fecal microbiome transplantation has become an effective treatment for refractory Clostridium difficile infections and other diseases [7, 8] . The mechanisms of interaction between the gut bacterial microbiome and the host are very complex, and other components also play crucial roles in this process. In addition to bacteria, viruses are also abundant in the gut [9] and have been hypothesized to markedly alter the structure and function of the bacterial community [10] [11] [12] . Additionally, chronic viral infection can confer increased resistance against pathogenic challenges [13] . Gut virome alteration has been observed in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease [14] . The recent advent of highthroughput sequencing methods has made it possible to study these communities and their relationships with health and disease in detail [15] .",

Transfer of whole virome communities between humans was documented in fecal microbiome transplantation [16] , and the difference varied more widely between gut viromes than between gut bacterial microbiomes in humans [17] . However, the relationship between the bacterial microbiome and the virome has rarely been studied, despite its likely medical importance. Previous research has shown close relationships between single viral species and single bacterial species [18, 19] , and single viral species could trigger shifts in the bacterial microbiome and the virome [20, 21] . At the same time, enteric bacteria were seen to be required for efficient infection by [22, 23] or suppression of [24] viruses, and the richness of the gut bacterial microbiome had an obvious effect on bacteriophage composition [25] ; moreover, the gut virome composition in humans was examined, and bacteriophage diversity was found to be inversely correlated with naturally occurring bacterial diversity in human infants during healthy development [26] . However, few studies have focused on how the whole virome, a diverse community consisting of eukaryotic RNA and DNA viruses and bacteriophages, interacts with the bacterial microbiome.",

Our results suggest that a majority of bacteria were depleted after the monkeys were treated with antibiotics and that the composition of the whole virome changed drastically. Importantly, alteration of the virome along with shifts in the composition and function of the gut bacterial community and metabolites from gut bacteria may have played an important role in the interaction.",

An antibiotic cocktail containing ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/ kg 3 times per day for 2 weeks. Three healthy one-year-old rhesus monkeys were treated with antibiotics, and fresh fecal samples were collected one day before treatment with antibiotics and 5, 8, and 9 days after treatment with antibiotics and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. Fresh fecal samples from an additional three normal monkeys were collected after the monkeys were treated with antibiotics for 9 days. The bacterial community of each sample was detected by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and the virome communities in the samples collected before treatment with antibiotics and in those collected after treatment with antibiotics for 9 days were detected by deep sequencing. Because metabolome analysis requires 6 biological duplications, the metabolomes of samples collected before treatment with antibiotics and of those collected after treatment with antibiotics for 8 and 9 days were detected by GC-MS and LC-MS. In our analysis, samples collected before treatment with antibiotics were used as the control group, and samples collected after treatment with antibiotics were used as the experimental group.",

For metagenome prediction, PICRUSt takes an input OTU table containing identifiers that match tips from the marker gene with corresponding abundances for each of the OTUs across one or more samples. First, PICRUSt normalizes the OTU table based on 16S rRNA amplicon copy number prediction so that the OTU abundances accurately reflect the true abundances of the underlying organisms. The metagenome is then predicted by looking up the precalculated genome content for each OTU, multiplying the normalized OTU abundance by each KO abundance in the genome and summing these KO abundances together per sample.

The levels of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes decreased to 7.69% and below 0.01%, respectively; at the same time, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased to 92% (Additional file 2: Figure S2B ). Escherichia-Shigella were the major constituents of Proteobacteria, and other genera belonging to Proteobacteria were markedly depleted (Additional file 2 : Figure S2B , Additional file 3: Table S1 ). The fecal samples were spread on plates with the antibiotic cocktail, and a large number of colony-forming units (CFUs) were observed in the sample from D9 but not in the sample from D0. The 16S rRNA amplicons of single clones were sequenced, and we found that these clones belonged to Escherichia-Shigella (data not shown). As expected, the overall diversity and richness of the bacterial microbiome were depleted both stably and continuously (Fig. 3 b, c) . The Shannon diversity index showed that the diversity of the bacterial microbiome was significantly decreased after treatment with antibiotics and remained at a low level (Fig. 3B , Additional file 2: Figure S2C ). The richness of the bacterial microbiome was significantly decreased, as measured by the ACE (Fig. 3c , Additional file 2: Figure S2D ). In addition, Fig. 1 Experimental procedure. Three rhesus monkeys were treated with an antibiotic cocktail to control their gut bacterial microbiome, and we detected the longitudinal changes in the gut bacterial microbiome at D0, D5 and D9 by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Then, we extracted nucleic acids from the fecal supernatant at D0 and D9 and scanned the gut viromes of the monkeys. The samples for metabolomics were collected on D0, D8 and D9 and scanned by GC-MS and LC-MS. We comprehensively analyzed the interactions among the gut virome, bacterial microbiome and metabolomes based on the above results there were noticeable differences in bacterial \u03b2-diversity between control and experimental animals, as determined using principal component analysis (PCA), and the results showed good repeatability within a single group (Additional file 2: Figure S2F ).",

To comprehensively detect both DNA and RNA viruses, we filtered the fecal samples with a 0.45-\u03bcm filter and treated the samples with DNase I, after which, total DNA and RNA were extracted separately from the same fecal sample. Owing to low yield, amplification of the DNA and double-stranded cDNA by whole-genome amplification (using MDA) was necessary. Using the MiSeq 2 \u00d7 250 paired-end protocol on the Illumina MiSeq platform, we obtained an average of 54,590,439 \u00b1 14,898, 536 clean reads per MDA sample library and generated a total of 88,610 Mbp from 12 samples, allowing detailed investigation of the viral populations. To catalog the present genes, we predicted open reading frames (ORFs). A total of 478,694 ORFs were predicted; the average ORF length was 398.1603279 bp, with a maximum of 16,635 bp and a minimum of 100 bp. The Fig. 2 The bacterial microbiome was obviously depleted by treatment with antibiotics. Heatmap of the OUT percentage of every genus at 3 timepoints. Each point represents 3 biological replicates. The genera that belong to the same phylum are shown in the same color on the left. The total OTU number of 3 biological replicates for every genus was more than 10. The color bar represents the log of the percentage, the numbers in the heatmap are the log values of the OTU numbers, and the numbers in the bar are the percentages ecological signatures of the intestinal virome have been characterized. The largest percentage of sequences mapped to viromes in the fecal samples belonged to bacteriophages, accounting for over 80% of the sequences (Additional file 5: Table S2 ). We also identified eukaryotic DNA viruses and RNA viruses, as well as other viral families that are defined as \"unclassified\" in the NCBI Taxonomy database. In the raw data from the virome metagenomic analysis, RNA virus sequences were found in the DNA virus results, and DNA virus sequences were found in the RNA virus results, because the RNA virus sequences were wrongly affiliated with DNA viral genomes and vice versa. In addition, DNA viruses, especially bacteriophages, were the main components of the virome in our sequencing data, and the RNA from these viruses may have been extracted together with RNA viruses and vice versa. Thus, we excluded these data.",

Because metabolomic analysis requires 6 biological duplications, the metabolomes of 6 samples collected before treatment with antibiotics and those of samples collected after treatment with antibiotics for 8 and 9 days were examined by GC-MS and LC-MS. The metabolomic results exhibited good repeatability (Additional file 10: Figure S7 ). In GC-MS (Fig. 7b) , N-dimethylarginine was not detected in monkeys that were not treated with antibiotics, but the metabolite was present after antibiotic treatment. The levels of N-acetyltryptophan and N-methyltryptophan showed a 3.3-fold and 1.85-fold decrease, respectively, after treatment with antibiotics. In LC-MS (Fig. 7c) , we found that the levels of abruquinone B and sulfated dihydromenaquinone-9 exhibited a 30-fold and 5.6fold increase, respectively. Regrettably, in the present study, we did not measure the levels of glycosaminoglycan, which plays a very important role in reducing the viral population [40] . ",

            "text": "As reported by Adina Howe, Yatsunenko T and Alejandro Reyes, in the same environment and feeding conditions, the composition of the microbiota and virome could remain stable within an individual [17, 46, 47] . However, the gut microbial composition could be influenced by multiple interacting factors, such as diet [46] , antibiotic use [48] , age, geographical setting [47] , and several diseases, including chronic inflammation, obesity and diabetes [4] . In our study, the major reason for depletion of the gut bacterial microbiota was treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. The feeding conditions of the rhesus monkeys were stable in terms of their food and water consumption, and blood samples were monitored routinely, showing that there was no infection during the study period (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The bacterial composition exhibited stable and continuous depletion after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail, and we found that the virome composition changed noticeably and was correlated with the shifts in the bacterial community. Moreover, we found that metabolites produced by the gut bacterial microbiome may play a role in the interrelation. In addition, we found that the composition of the rhesus monkey enterovirus group was similar to that of the human enterovirus group [26] , and our results may be beneficial for research on the composition of the human virome. When the bacterial microbiome was depleted, ampicillin could kill most bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; streptomycin could kill most bacilli; kanamycin could kill most gram-negative bacteria; metronidazole could kill most anaerobic bacteria and parasites; and vancomycin could kill most gram-positive bacteria. Of course, the numbers of drug-resistant bacteria are increasing, but we believe that the cocktail of five antibiotics could deplete most of the commensal bacteria in the gut. As expected, the whole gut bacterial microbiome, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (Additional file 2: Figure S2E ), was depleted after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail, except for Escherichia-Shigella species belonging to Proteobacteria, which were resistant to the cocktail. Escherichia harbored the most diverse antibiotic resistance genes, including genes resistant to multidrug treatments, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin B, \u03b2-lactams, and sulfonamides [49] . We maintained the bacteria belonging to Escherichia-Shigella in plates with the antibiotic cocktail. In the future, we will investigate the specific resistance and antibiotic resistance genes in this bacterium. Notably, our study focused on the interaction between virome composition and the bacterial microbiome in rhesus monkeys and may serve as a model for gut microbiota analysis. Therefore, we used the administration of 5 distinct antibiotics at high dosages and high frequencies for 2 weeks to deplete the whole gut bacterial microbiome. In our results, the richness and diversity of the bacterial community were depleted. Because our study did not involve clinical treatment, the normal dose of antibiotics was not evaluated by our procedure. People are widely prescribed antibiotics each year [50] , and while antibiotics exert very complex effects on the whole bacterial microbiome [48] , the effects of these drugs on the virome are not clear. Antibiotics can directly affect viruses but do not exhibit a wide range of roles. Minocycline [51] , berberine, abamectin, ivermectin [52] , glycopeptides [53] , and teicoplanin [54] could inhibit the corresponding viruses. In our study design, an antibiotic cocktail that included ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin was administered orally. No study has yet reported that these antibiotics directly affect viruses.",

We first characterized the shift in the gut virome by deep sequencing, and the samples were amplified by MDA. MDA is used as a general technique in virome research, especially for DNA virome detection [26] . To a certain extent, the amplification read-out can also represent the virus quantity. However, MDA is not well suited to the detection of RNA viruses. The sequence-independent amplification (SIA) approach is more appropriate than MDA for detecting RNA viruses [55] . In the future, we can use this approach to precisely detect RNA viruses. In this case, we validated the depletion of the virome composition, including DNA viruses, RNA viruses and bacteriophages, by real-time PCR. Although the number of cycles seemed high, these results were verified via three biological replicates, and the results of the no-template control (NTC) were not detected. In addition, we performed serial dilution of the in vitro transcribed RNA of coxsackievirus A16 to generate a standard curve and found that a Ct of 39.96 represents 23 genomic copies (data not shown). In our opinion, these viruses are components of the gut microbiome with low richness and may be involved in host physiology.",

In our results, the level of quinone, which decreases the abundance of viruses, was increased in the gut metabolome, and the levels of some amino acids that promote the survival of viruses, such as tryptophan, were decreased. Importantly, glycosaminoglycan, which can reduce the populations of various viruses, was noticeably increased in the KEGG pathways of the bacterial microbiome, but we did not measure glycosaminoglycan levels in the present study. It is very difficult to detect glycosaminoglycan by metabolic scanning because glycosaminoglycan has a very high molecular weight. In the future, glycosaminoglycan levels could be measured by time-offlight mass spectrometry. First, the polysaccharide needs to be dispelled, followed by detection of the monosaccharide to calculate the polysaccharide levels based on the relationships among the monosaccharides in a specific database. However, this process is very complicated, and the database is not sufficiently large at present. By analyzing the relevant data, we found that depletion of bacteria directly promoted changes in the concentrations of some metabolites, which may play important roles in reducing the abundance of DNA viruses.",
