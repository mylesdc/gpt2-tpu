            "text": "Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10 4 DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.",

The differential diagnosis of such patients includes infectious etiologies, of which viruses are the most common [2] , but also non-infectious etiologies, such as auto-immune diseases [3] . Nonetheless, in more than half of cases, the cause remains unknown [4] . Identification of a virus can aid in patient management as it may initiate specific antiviral treatment, or cease or prevent ineffective antiviral, antibiotic, and/or immunosuppressive treatments, which all have potential harmful side effects. For example, when differentiating between an auto-immune and viral origin, immune suppression could lead to deleterious outcomes when caused by an unidentified virus [5] .",

Briefly, CSF samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was treated with TURBO\u2122 DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove naked chromosomal or bacterial DNA. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Boom method [20] , followed by reverse transcription with non-ribosomal random hexamers [21] and second strand synthesis. DNA was digested with MseI (T\u02c6TAA; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligated to adapters containing a sample identifier sequence. During the fragmentation in VIDISCA, the sample cannot be \"over-digested\" as fragmentation relies entirely on the presence of restriction enzyme recognition sites and not on the duration of fragmentation. Ligation to adaptors leads to loss of the restriction enzyme recognition site (after ligation to an adaptor the sequence is TTAT) whereas ligation to another DNA fragment will restore it, allowing re-digestion. Next, size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was performed to remove small DNA fragments prior to a 28-cycle PCR using adaptor-annealing primers. Small and large size selection was performed with AMPure XP beads to select DNA-strands with a length ranging between 100 and 400 nucleotides. Libraries were analyzed using the Bioanalyzer (High Sensitivity Kit, Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Qubit (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) instruments to quantify DNA length and concentration, respectively. Seventy sample libraries were pooled at the equimolar concentration. The current number of 70 samples was chosen because this has worked for other sample types (non-CSF) [16, 17] . In total, 50 pmol DNA of the pool was clonally amplified on beads using the Ion Chef System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequencing was performed on the Ion PGM\u2122 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the ION 316 Chip (400 bp read length and 2 million sequences per run). The method for the DNase-free VIDISCA library preparation omitted the TURBO\u2122 DNase step.",

Probable viral reads were subsequently confirmed when the original VIDISCA-NGS read could be aligned to a reference sequence of the virus with a nucleotide identity of at least 80% using CodonCode Aligner (version 6.0.2). Each alignment was manually inspected for confirmation. Samples were considered VIDISCA-NGS positive when at least one VIDISCA-NGS read could be identified. The number of reads aligned to a reference sequence in CodonCode Aligner was taken as the number of viral reads per sample. Analysis by VIDISCA-NGS was performed blind to qPCR results to avoid biased analysis.

The RNA virus concentration in the VIDISCA-NGS positive samples ranged between 1.07 \u00d7 10 2 RNA copies/mL and 8.64 \u00d7 10 5 RNA copies/mL (median: 8.63 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies/mL). Two samples positive for enterovirus and two for HIV-1 by qPCR were missed by VIDISCA-NGS, with viral loads ranging from 9.40 \u00d7 10 2 to 1.05 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies/mL (median 2.54 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies/mL). To exclude that competition by background nucleic acids or other viruses might have hampered virus detection, we assessed whether co-infection by other pathogens or large quantities of the host genomic background had competed with viral sequences in the four samples that were negative in VIDISCA-NGS. The profile of the background sequences of the negative samples was similar to those of the positive samples, indicating that no major sequence competition was present ( Figure 2 ). Next, we determined whether the sequencing depth of the four negative samples, in combination with the low viral load, may have been insufficient. All four missed samples had fewer than 10,000 sequence reads and had a viral load below 2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, as depicted in the lower left quadrant of Figure  1 . Overall, this quadrant contained nine samples of which five were positive and four were negative by VIDISCA-NGS. The five positive samples had only one (n = 4) or two (n = 1) reads mapped to the detected RNA virus. These small numbers of viral reads suggest that such samples (with low viral load, combined with a low sequencing depth) were on the detection limit of VIDISCA-NGS. Samples with a similarly low viral load, but with a higher sequence depth (upper left quadrant of Figure 1 ), had, on average, more than 5 viral reads per sample. Moreover, a correlation between sequence depth and viral read number was seen for all samples below 10 4 RNA copies/mL (rho = 0.64 p = 0.02, Spearman's rank correlation test).

Thus, it is likely that VIDISCA-NGS is able to detect viruses from these families in CSF with similar sensitivities. However, our current findings now indicate there is one viral family difficult to detect with VIDISCA-NGS, namely the Herpesviridae. VIDISCA-NGS was only able to detect one high load herpesvirus (VZV, 9.29 \u00d7 10 7 DNA copies/mL) out of 34 qPCR positive samples. We hypothesized that our nuclease treatment hindered herpesvirus detection, and omitting a DNase treatment indeed yielded an additional 10 samples that were positive for herpesvirus. Of the medium to high load herpesviruses (>10 4 RNA copies/mL), DNase-free VIDISCA-NGS detected 61%.",

Similarly, Perlejewski et al. described a four-fold decrease in HSV-1 reads when using a DNase treatment for metagenomics on CSF [34] . Our study expands on this knowledge by showing that the vulnerability to DNase also applies to the other herpesviruses. This vulnerability signifies that the performance of metagenomic assays should not be evaluated on spiked samples. Herpesvirus culture harvests contain infectious virions with non-fragmented DNA [33, 35] , whereas herpesvirus in cell-free clinical material is non-infectious and, as mentioned above, contains highly fragmented DNA [33, 36] . The only two studies that examined the performance of a metagenomics assay to detect herpesviruses used virus culture harvests, and found low limits of detection (\u224810 1 and 10 3 DNA copies/mL for CMV and HSV-1, respectively) [25, 26] . Caution should be taken to translate these findings to a clinical setting, as virus culture harvests are, especially for herpesviruses, not a correct representative of reality.",

During the lytic replication phase, large amounts of non-infective naked progeny virus are released from the cell and may enter the CSF if replication occurs in the CNS compartment. Because of the high genome copy number and the generally low DNase activity in CSF [38] , degradation may take a significant amount of time. Naked herpesvirus DNA could thus persist for an extensive amount of time in CSF, even after the local infection has ceased. In theory, the persistence of naked DNA could also occur for other DNA viruses, such as HPV and TTV. These viruses use similar replication strategies to herpesviruses. The detection of these DNA viruses by VIDISCA-NGS was, however, not hampered by a DNase treatment (Figure 4) , indicating that the viral DNA of these viruses was part of an intact virion.",

For that reason, VIDISCA-NGS implements an amplification step to increase the number of viral genomic fragments from CSF. We previously found that viruses with a concentration of >10 4 copies/mL were detected when 5000 sequence reads or more were generated per sample from nasopharyngeal swabs [17] . Since then, we have used this number as a threshold to ensure that a sufficient sequence depth was achieved for virus detection. Our current results suggest this threshold may have to be increased for CSF. All RNA virus samples missed by VIDISCA-NGS had fewer than 10,000 reads and a strong correlation between the sequencing depth and number of viral reads was observed. Increasing the sequence depth could therefore increase the detection of low load RNA viruses. As such, we recommend to generate 10,000 or more reads per sample.",

Because the performance of VIDISCA-NGS remains lower than qPCR, especially for the detection of herpesviruses, VIDISCA-NGS cannot replace conventional diagnostics.
