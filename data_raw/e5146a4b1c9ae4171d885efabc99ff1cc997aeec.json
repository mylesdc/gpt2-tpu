            "text": "After the first reported case of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil, in 2015, a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed. Microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant's head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes ZIKV. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using the High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (toll-like receptor signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways (neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal system development) that are associated with these interactors. Our novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of ZIKV for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that was initially isolated from rhesus monkeys in 1947 and was first reported in humans in 1952 1 . The flavivirus genus contains around 70 viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridiae, a family of positive sense, singlestranded, enveloped RNA viruses 2 , that also include Dengue virus, West nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and Hepatitis C virus 3 . Until recently, ZIKV reports had been limited to Africa and Asia 4 but it became a wide-spread ZIKV epidemic 5 . The virus spread rapidly across the Americas and was declared a 'global emergency' by the World Health Organization 6 . It is mostly transmitted by mosquitoes and clinical manifestations include rash, mild fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and headaches. In addition, the virus can be transmitted sexually, with the risk of infection persisting for several months after initial contact 7 . While the symptoms of ZIKV can be mild 1 , the virus has been linked to two more serious afflictions: Guillen-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) 8, 9 and microcephaly 10-14 , both of which are serious neurological conditions. Microcephaly results in reduced head circumference measurement in infants, exhibiting complications in brain development. Of particular concern is the attribution of microcephaly to infection with ZIKV occurring between the first two trimesters of pregnancy 13, 14 . Evidence linking ZIKV to microcephaly includes detection of ZIKV RNA in tissue such as the placenta and amniotic fluid of pregnant women with ZIKV, as well as in the brains of stillborn infants with microcephaly 15 . In a study with human induced pluripotency stem cells, the mechanism of ZIKV related cell death has been elucidated. This study demonstrated that ZIKV infects human embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), ultimately leading to attenuated population growth mediated by virally induced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and cell-cycle dysregulation 16 . Furthermore, mice studies showed that ZIKV infection can lead to nerve degeneration, softening of the brain and porencephaly 17 . Additional studies have assessed the causal relation between ZIKV infection and birth defects, and the role of ZIKV as a cause of congenital defects and as a trigger of GBS has been established 10, 18, 19 .",

The IFITM protein family belongs to a group of small (10 -15kDa) 20 interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which are in turn produced by the interferon system 21 . The interferon system is the host's primary response against infection which restricts entry and fusion from late endosomes 22 , with some ISGs being involved in suppressing the early stages of viral replication 21,23,24 . IFITMs are located at the cell plasma and endosomal membranes, which are the means of entry of many viruses 25 . This protein family protects the host against viral infection by directly restricting entry and fusion from late endosomes 26 .",

Mice that are lacking immune sensors, signaling pathways and effector molecules were found to be susceptible to flavivirus infection highlighting the importance of the host's innate immune response to these viruses 5, 30, 31 . Recent literature has demonstrated that during ZIKV infection, the production of several types of interferon and ISGs is increased, and that IFITM1 and IFITM3 are involved in inhibiting ZIKV infection during the early stages of pathogenesis 7,30-33 . Enveloped viruses, such as ZIKV, have a membrane of host cell lipids that contains viral fusion proteins; these proteins mediate fusion between the virus and the endosomal membrane of the host cell, a necessary step for initiating infection 21,34 . The precise mechanisms by which IFITMs inhibit infection are yet to be described. However, IFITM3 has been shown to impact the function of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) by directly interacting with VAPA. This leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes, preventing the fusion of the intraluminal virion-containing vesicles with endosomal membranes 35 . Additionally, IFITM1 has been shown to suppress cell to cell fusion (syncytia formation) by localizing to the plasma membrane after interferon induction 21 .",

For instance, murine models of ZIKV infection require deficiency of type 1 interferon signaling, which suggests a role for ISGs in restricting infection 7,36 . Therefore, prior to the induction of ISGs, IFITMs may provide initial defense against the infection 7 . Furthermore, IFITMs have been found to restrict virus replication among other flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Dengue virus 23, 37, 38 . Recently, the role of IFITM3 as an antiviral protein against West Nile virus has been explored in vivo, and Ifitm3 -/mice exhibited a greater susceptibility to lethal viral infection, with a greater accumulation of viral protein in peripheral organs and central nervous system tissues 26 . Additionally, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 have been shown to have antiviral properties in humans. Polymorphisms in human IFITM3 correlate with the severity of influenza A infection 38 . These functional members are expressed across a variety of tissues in humans and out of the three, IFITM3 is thought to be the most potent line of defense against viral infection 21 .",

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) prove to be valuable in understanding the function of a protein, and specifically in how it plays a role in causing or preventing disease. Motivated by this, we had developed a computational model called 'High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction' (HiPPIP) model that identifies novel PPIs in the human interactome 39 using machine learning to classify features of protein-pairs such as colocalization, coexpression, shared molecular function and biological processes. HiPPIP was also instrumental in discovering that oligoadenylate synthetase like protein (OASL) interacts with retinoic acid inducible gene I product (RIG-I) to activate the RIG-I immunity pathway during influenza viral infection inhibiting virus replication 40 . Functional studies initiated solely by this predicted PPI showed that human OASL binds to dsRNA to enhance RIG-I signaling, and that boosting OASL can help inhibit viral infection 40 . Using novel PPIs predicted with HiPPIP, we could explain the apparent discordance between modern and historical genetic basis of schizophrenia 41 , and the role of cilia in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease 42 . PPIs predicted by our method revealed a molecular basis for the negative association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis 43 . These successes demonstrate that there is enormous potential for biomedical discovery buried in the largely-unexplored novel PPIs in the human interactome.",

HiPPIP uses a score cut-off of 0.5 to achieve a high precision of 97.5%, albeit successfully predicting only a few PPIs (recall of 5%), when evaluated on a held-out test data. Thus, the novel PPIs predicted by HiPPIP are highly dependable to lead to successful experiments. Furthermore, predicted PPIs with scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.65 were experimentally validated and found to be true interacting pairs 39 . The HiPPIP model was also computationally evaluated on hub proteins and showed a better performance when compared to Qi et al.'s model 39, 46 . HiPPIP is configured to present protein-pairs achieving a score of greater than 0.5 to be novel PPIs. Additional information regarding experimental validation of predicted interactions and model evaluation are available in prior work 39 . IFITM interactome figure was created using Cytoscape 47 .

These predictions were obtained by using an experimentally and computationally validated algorithm HiPPIP, and are estimated to be highly accurate. Novel PPIs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 shed light on possible mechanisms of host invasion adopted by Zika virus including suppression of the immune system and cognitive and birth defects following infection. Based on the predicted protein-protein interactions, and the functions of the interacting proteins, we formulated three hypotheses about mechanisms of Zika virus infection. Cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells may be associated with microcephaly induced by Zika virus IFITM1 and three of the novel interactors (NME5, UIMC1 and DYNLT3) were found in cilia interactome (i.e. interactome of proteins of the organelle cilia), and seemed to be associated with processes that led to hydrocephalus, a condition frequently associated with ciliopathies, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulate in the brain ventricle giving rise to an enlarged head, viz. dysfunction of ciliated ependymal cells in the brain (unpublished results) 55 . The fact that multiciliated ependyma is infected by a wide variety of viruses, possess motile cilia, micro villi and aherens junctions and also mediate cellular infiltration into the CNS indicate that it may be functioning as an immunological barrier 56,57 . This may point at the possibility that the multiciliated ependymal functions as a barrier which is also susceptible to the mechanisms of host invasion adopted by Zika virus and that cilia dysfunction may be a potential mechanism. In a recent study, delay in cilia disassembly was identified to be the cause of premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the ventricular zone which led to microcephaly 58 . In an earlier study, the same group linked premature differentiation of NPCs to infection by Zika virus and impaired brain cellularity and structural organization of the cortical plate that follows 59 .",

Interestingly, it has been reported that radial glial cells (RGCs), that give rise to ependymal cells, and astrocytes are more susceptible to infection by Zika virus than neurons 60 . Moreover, RGCs constitute a barrier between brain parenchyma-a site of Zika infection-and ventricles from the embryonic stage 61 . Fetal mice infected with Zika virus exhibit a reduction in the size of lateral ventricles 62 . It has also been suggested that genes implicated in microcephaly may also influence the development of hydrocephalus. For example, ASPM which has undergone rapid evolution over the course of recent evolution of hominids is implicated in the size of cerebral cortex and neurogenesis and is also associated with primary microcephaly 63 . The identification of ASH domains in ASPM has indicated that it may also be implicated in cilia dysfunction and hydrocephalus 64 . ASH domains are normally found in proteins that localize to cilia, such as Hydin and OCRL which are associated with microcephaly and Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome respectively 65,66 . In this respect, it has also been observed that injection of pregnant mice with Zika virus, leads to infection of RGCs that are responsible for cortex development located in the dorsal ventricular zone of fetal mice 67 .",

It is induced during maturation stages of angiogenesis in vitro while in vivo it is stably expressed by microvascular endothelial cells which are quiescent 68 . A role for IFITM1 in formation of stable contacts between cells during lumen formation in endothelial tissue was revealed by a study. On knockdown of IFITM1, intercellular vacuoles failed to fuse and form a multicellular lumen due to the mislocalization of OCLN (occludin), which normally interacts with IFITM1 and localizes to tight junctions between endothelial cells 68 . It was speculated that the mechanism allowing IFITM1 to regulate assembly of tight junctions may be related to endosomal trafficking since internalized OCLN is returned to the plasma membrane from recycling endosomes during remodeling of tight junctions in endothelial cells. IFITM1 has also been shown to function in the endosomal pathway to inhibit viral infection 69 . Microcephaly may arise due to dysfunctional DNA repair systems that lead to increased apoptosis of neural progenitor cells having a low endurance for damage and under normal conditions, migrate to the cortical plate to form various structures in the brain 70 . Depletion of RAB80 or UIMC1-a novel interactor of IFITM1-which occurs in a complex with p73 when overexpressed, impairs translocation of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites resulting in defective control of cell cycle and repair of double strand breaks 71,72 . p73 has been implicated in the development and maintenance of ependymal cells and in animals deficient in p73, increased apoptosis and lack of differentiation of RGCs into ependymal cells accompanied by loss of motile cilia resulting in hydrocephalus and hippocampal dysgenesis were reported 73,74 . NME5 is highly expressed in ependymal cells and moderate to marked hydrocephalus along with ciliary dysfunction has been observed in mice homozygous for NME5 75 . It is known that patients with HSV-2 (Herpes simplex virus-2) infection are more susceptible to the teratogenic effects induced by Zika virus, since HSV-2 infection enhances the sensitivity of placental tissue which facilitates the entry of Zika virus into cells mediated by TAM receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 76, 77 . It has been shown that VP26, the capsid surface protein of HSV, interacts with DYNLT3 which is a component of the motor protein, cytoplasmic dynein 1, mediating retrograde movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules within cells 78 .",

The changes included in this revised manuscript somewhat improve the description of the HiPPiP model and add some useful (albeit highly speculative) discussion of the potential mechanisms of IFITM antiviral activities against ZIKV. However, I am still not entirely convinced of the validity of the HiPPiP model and some of the the statements supporting this model appear to be exaggerated (e.g. \"Thus, the novel PPIs -I am not sure what this predicted by HiPPIP are highly dependable to lead to successful experiments\" means, and \"Furthermore, predicted PPIs with scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.65 were experimentally -I am not convinced about the experimental validation validated and found to be true interacting pairs\" detailed in this prior publication as the presented immunoprecipitation data does not include appropriate negative controls, molecular weight markers, details about antibody sources or specificity etc.). Future studies of this nature would be greatly strengthened by experimental validation of computationally predicted protein-protein interactions and exploration of the importance of the candidate host factors for the ZIKV replication cycle (e.g. via knockdown / knockout and/or pharmacological targeting of the candidate host factor and examination of effects on the ZIKV replication cycle).",

I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. The manuscript in review uses a previously tested model of protein-protein interaction (PPI) called High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) to predict novel PPIs of two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1 and IFITM3. The authors cite previously reported data on the role of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in inhibiting Zika virus (ZIKV) and make a valid argument that the novel PPIs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 from the HiPPIP model could possibly predict mechanisms of host invasion and immune suppression by Zika virus (ZIKV) and members of its family . They also analyze functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins and Flaviviridae . They also analyze functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins and Flaviviridae discuss possible roles of these proteins as targets for ZIKV infection. The title, abstract and article are clearly presented and make an engaging read. Although the authors present an extensive discussion on novel interactors, the article ends arbitrarily. A conclusion paragraph summarizing the results and presenting new ideas for future research would be apt.",

This statement is not well-justified and may be misleading. In support of the HiPPIP model, the author refers to the successful prediction of OASL interaction with RIG-I ('Functional studies initiated solely by this predicted PPI showed...'). However in the cited publication (on which Dr. Ganapathiraju is an author) the HiPPIP model (and associated publications) was not referred to.
