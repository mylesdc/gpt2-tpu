            "text": "Chronic hepatitis C, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a global health problem. Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein. We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains. The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection. Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2. We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-a and (interleukin) IL-6. Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen. In addition, we propose that rVV-N25 could be developed as an effective therapeutic vaccine.",

To address this problem, we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transgene; our system involves the Cre/loxP system and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recombinase [5, 6] . Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV proteins could induce immune responses [5] and, therefore, obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on chronic liver pathology. Therefore, here, we used a Cre/loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression; with this system, we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins. Folgori et al. (2006) reported effective vaccination of chimpanzees with an adenoviral vector and plasmid DNA encoding the HCV nonstructural region. This technique protected the liver tissues from acute hepatitis, which results when whole animals are challenged with virus [7] . However, this vaccine has not yet been shown to be effective against chronic HCV infection.",

However, the Ad-Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein (serum ALT level over 2,000 IU/L) [5] ; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient (about 2 weeks). Therefore, this Ad-Cre-dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to chronic HCV hepatitis.",

However, experimental results obtained with this mouse model may not directly translate to clinical findings from patients with HCV infection because the expression of HCV proteins was not liver specific in these mice.

Even if a small population of specific CD8+ T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of core protein, it is difficult to assert that the only NS2specific CD8+ T cells were important to this reduction. However, based on the results presented in Figure 4B , we are able to conclude that at least CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells were important to the reduction in HCV core protein.

The HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2 proteins) in the rVV-CN construct may cause the difference; Saito et al. reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB/c mice [24] . Reportedly, CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins, but core-specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [21] . In contrast, when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB/c mice, only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia-specific CTL responses [25] . Thus, the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [26] . Based on these reports and our results, we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV-N25 treatment were as follows: 1) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2) the core protein had an immune-suppressive effect on CTL induction. Therefore, we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design.",

This result indicated that rVV-N25 may modulate inflammation via innate immunity, as well as via acquired immunity. Reportedly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [27] . TLR2 and TLR9 have also been implicated in the recognition of the vaccinia virus [28, 29] . These findings indicate that TLR on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV-N25 in our model of HCV infection; however, further examination of this hypothesis is required. The finding that pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF-a and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies indicated that the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum, rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes. Lymphocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and adipocytes each produce TNF-a and IL-6 [30, 31] , and HCV-infected patients have elevated levels of TNF-a and IL-6 [32, 33] . Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet [34] , and production of TNF-a and IL-6 is elevated in obese mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [35] .

The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [40] . R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) to produce R6CN2HCV-MxCre and R6CN5HCV-MxCre transgenic mice, which were designated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and RzCN5-15 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, respectively. Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England); 300 mL of a poly(I:C) solution (1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was injected three times at 48-h intervals.

Separate full-length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein, nonstructural protein, or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain (genotype 1b) RNA by RT-PCR. Each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter; the final designation of each recombinant plasmid was pBMSF7C-CN2, pBMSF7C-N25, or pBMSF-CN5 (Figure 2 ). They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 (multiplicity of infection = 10). The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use. The hemagglutinin-negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [42] and named rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, or rVV-CN5. Insertion of the HCV protein genes into the LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR, and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis. The titers of rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, and rVV-CN5 were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells.",

            "text": "Figure 1. Pathogenesis in immunocompetent mice with persistent HCV expression. (A) Structure of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and the Cremediated activation of the transgene unit. R6CN2 HCV cDNA was cloned downstream of the CAG promoter, neomycin-resistant gene (neo), and poly A (pA) signal flanked by two loxP sequences. This cDNA contains the core, E1, E2, and NS2 regions. (B) Cre-mediated genomic DNA recombination. After poly(I:C) injection, genomic DNA was extracted from liver tissues and analyzed by quantitative RTD-PCR for Cre-mediated transgenic recombination. The transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after the injection. In all cases, n = 3 mice per group. (C) HCV core protein expression was sustained for at least 600 days after poly(I:C) injection. (D) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that most hepatocytes expressed the HCV core protein within 6 days after injection. (E) Liver sections from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice after the poly(I:C) injection. Infiltrating lymphocytes (arrows) were observed on days 6 and 180; Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed on day 360. In contrast, these pathological changes were not observed in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice after the injection. The inset image shows abnormal mitosis in a tumor cell. (F) Hepatocyte swelling and abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords (silver staining), as well as abnormal glycogen accumulation (PAS staining) were observed on day 90 in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice. We observed steatosis (oil-red-O staining) on day 180 and, subsequently, fibrosis (Azan staining) on day 480. The scale bars indicate 50 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g001",
