Interestingly, the study of gene-environment interactions showed that rhinovirus was significantly associated with recurrent wheezing in the presence of IL4Ra-rs1801275GG and G (odds ratio [OR] 6.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-30.10, p = 0.03) and MAP3K1-rs702689AA (OR 4.09, 95% CI: 1.14-14.61, p = 0.03). Conclusions: This study shows a clear relationship between the risk of wheezing and polymorphisms of some genes involved in the immune response. Although further studies are needed to confirm the results, these findings may be useful for the early identification of children at the highest risk of developing recurrent episodes and possibly subsequent asthma.",

However, a substantial number of children experience wheezing every time they suffer from a respiratory viral infection, and up to 50% of these subjects develop asthma during school age [3] . The reasons for these different wheezing phenotypes are still unclear. A number of clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that the severity of individual episodes, the risk of recurrence, and the risk of developing asthma are frequently associated with the presence of atopy or particular clinical or environmental conditions such as prematurity and exposure to tobacco smoke [4, 5] . Microbiological studies have shown that not all viruses have the same potential for causing severe or recurrent cases, and that RSV [6] and RV [7] are more frequently identified in the respiratory secretions of subjects with recurrent wheezing. However, analysis of the data collected in studies of the possible relationships between viral LRTIs and wheezing has shown that, even in the absence of known risk factors, a considerable number of children experience severe and/or frequently recurring infections with wheezing, and develop asthma during adolescence [2] .",

However, little is known about which immune response mechanisms modified by genetic defects play the major role in conditioning susceptibility to wheezing, or what can be done to increase host defences in such cases. The precise identification of the specific genetic variants involved in immunity that are associated with an increased risk of LRTIs with recurrent wheezing has foreseeable applications in pediatrics, preventive medicine and vaccine development, and it can be expected that analysing methods that can reduce the negative impact of genetic defects in innate or adaptive immunity will have considerable consequences.",

Susceptibility to the development of wheezing seems to be greater in children with SNPs of the IL8 (rs4073AT), VEGFA (rs833058CT), MBL2 (rs1800450CT) and IKBKB genes (rs3747811AT). The association with IL8, VEGFA and MBL2 genes is not surprising because the factors encoded by them play an important role in immunity and have been previously associated with bronchial obstruction [8] [9] [10] [11] . IL8 is one of the most important chemotactic factors for leukocyte recruitment and activation in the lung, and has to be controlled to prevent excessive tissue injury and possibly damaging systemic effects [1] . The SNP of IL8 evaluated in this study has previously been found to be significantly associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing episodes [22] , and it has also been found that a high concentration of IL-8 in cord blood is significantly associated with persistent wheezing at the age of one year [23] . Its importance in conditioning susceptibility to wheezing seems to confirmed by the finding that it was the only genetic polymorphism associated with the risk of wheezing and susceptibility to recurrent episodes. VEGFA is a major regulator of angiogenesis and enhancer of vascular permeability [24] , and seems to induce airway inflammation and airway remodelling in patients with asthma [25] . High VEGFA levels have been found in subjects with chronic pulmonary diseases [26] and certain kinds of pneumonia [27] , and have been found to be significantly higher in the serum of children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and wheezing than in healthy controls [28] .",

The data concerning NFKBIB, a factor involved in innate immunity, conflict with those collected by Daley et al. [10] and Sharma et al. [11] , who studied a large number of SNPs and found that children with a genetic abnormality in NFKBIB and viral respiratory infection in early life were at increased risk of developing asthma. The data concerning CTLA4 are in line with the findings of some authors [34] , but not others [35] . This factor plays an essential role in the function of the regulatory T cells that control Th1 and Th2 immune responses [33] , and Borrego et al. have reported that, in comparison with healthy children, CTLA4 expression is diminished in wheezy subjects and those at high risk of asthma, thus suggesting that impaired CTLA4 expression may play a role in reducing bronchial obstruction [34] . However, Ermers et al. found that CTLA43087243AG was significantly more frequent in children with wheezing than in healthy controls [35] . TLR3 recognises dsRNA derived from respiratory viruses and activates nuclear factor-\u03baB, which increases interferon\u03b3 signalling in other cells and transforms airway inflammation into asthma [36] . Th2 cytokines participate in this process by modulating the response of airway epithelium and dendritic cells to dsRNA11 and, in the context of RV infection, the binding of viral dsRNA to TLR3 initiates pro-inflammatory signalling pathways that lead to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness [37] . Contrary to our own findings, Nuolivirta et al. found that TLR3-rs3752291TC was associated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis and that TLR3-rs3752291CC was significantly more frequent in patients with recurrent wheezing [38] . Moreover, Daley et al. documented a positive association between TLR3 SNPs and atopic asthma [10] . These discrepancies may be due to differences in the ethnicity and general characteristics of the study populations, such as differences in wheezing phenotypes, because it has been found that recurrent wheezing during the first year after viral LRTI and recurrent wheezing at the age of six years are distinct entities with their own specific immunological and genetic characteristics [39] . It also possible that the results were influenced by gene-gene interactions and/or differences in HWE.",

The IL4Ra gene encodes the alpha chain of the interleukin-4 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that can bind IL4 and IL13 and thus regulate IgE antibody production in B cells [40] , and the encoded protein can also bind IL4 in T cells to promote differentiation of Th2 cells. Allelic variations in this gene have been associated with atopy and allergic clinical manifestations [40] . Furthermore, RV infections are a major cause of asthma exacerbations [41, 42] , and RVs have also been repeatedly detected in patients with stable asthma [43] . A number of studies have shown abnormalities in innate immune responses to viruses in patients with asthma, particularly deficiencies in the production of IFN I and III [44] [45] [46] . The finding that a SNP in the IL4Ra gene is associated with recurrent wheezing episodes during RV LRTI further contributes to explaining the complications that could follow RV infection.",

Our data extend the findings of Szczepankiewicz et al., who observed an association between asthma and MAP3K1 gene polymorphisms rs702689 and rs889312, and suggested that genetic variants of the MAP3K1 gene involved in regulating neurogenic inflammation may contribute to asthma possibly via enhanced NGF expression and the activation of the MAPK signalling pathway [47] . Our study has some limitations. First of all, the number of enrolled subjects was relatively small and further studies of larger pediatric populations would increase the probability that the statistical associations found by us represent true biological differences and reduce the risk of false positive results. Secondly, although considerable, the number of studied genes and SNPs was probably less than the number of genes and genetic variations actually involved in regulating the mechanisms that play a role in conditioning susceptibility to infection and the development of wheezing. Finally, we did not evaluate the effect of common environmental exposure on the associations between the genes of the immune pathway and wheezing but, as it has been suggested that environmental exposure may modify the effect of such genetic variants on disease susceptibility, an analysis of gene-environmental interactions is necessary before drawing any definite conclusions.",
