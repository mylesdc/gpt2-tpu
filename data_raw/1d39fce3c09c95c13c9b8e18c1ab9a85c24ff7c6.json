In experiment 2, Groups 5 and 6 were inoculated with AIV subtype H9N2 through nasal route in 1 day old, Group 5 was vaccinated with live IBV vaccine and live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine in 5 and 18 days old, respectively, Groups 6 and 7 were vaccinated with live NDV vaccine in 18 days old, and Group 8 was left as a negative control. Chicks were kept in isolators for 18 days in the first experiment and 35 days in the second experiment. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 day's old chicks from all groups in experiment 1 and 21, 23, 25, and 28 days old from all groups in experiment 2. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was applied on the collected tracheal swabs for detecting RNA copies of H9N2 AIV. Cloacal swabs and the positive rRT-PCR tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to confirm rRT-PCR results. Internal organs (kidney, trachea, and spleen) from all chicken groups were collected weekly for histopathological examination to determine severity of the lesions. Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis for the detection of humoral immune response against H9N2, NDV, and IBV from all chicken groups.",

Type A influenza viruses are classified into different subtypes according to the two major surface glycoprotein: Hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [1] . Avian influenza virus (AIV) is divided into two groups based on their pathogenicity including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in which mortality may be as high as 100%, and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) which causes milder respiratory disease [2] . Laboratory examinations in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken demonstrate that H9N2 AIV is low pathogenic [3] . It is almost one decade that the Middle East and Asian countries are facing frequent outbreaks of H9N2 infection [4, 5] . Mixed infection or coinfection of H9N2 AIV with other respiratory pathogens is one of the possible explanations for increasing the economic losses of H9N2 infection in commercial broiler chickens [6, 7] . It was reported that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection increased the pathogenicity and extended the period of H9N2 AIV shedding in broiler chickens [6] [7] [8] .",

Therefore, there was serological evidence for the presence of H9N2 infection in chicken population during 2001 [10] . In Alexandria, isolated H9N2 virus from chicken flocks Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.11/July-2018/15.pdf suffering from respiratory symptom with high morbidity rates (up to 70%) and mortality rate reaching 15% was analyzed. Blast analysis of the nucleotide sequences from the eight viral genes showed that the recently isolated Egyptian H9N2 strain was closely related to the other Middle East H9N2 strains [11] . The virus shared the common ancestor -the A/Qa/ HK/G1/97 isolate -which contributed to the internal genes of the H5N1 virus circulating in Asia [4] .",

Mixed infection with other respiratory pathogens as IBV circulating in the field may be one of the causes for increasing pathogenicity of the virus causing great losses in poultry production [21] . Furthermore, it was reported that mixed infection of AIV H9N2 with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus paragallinarum activated HA of the virus and increased its replication and spread [22] . Furthermore, Escherichia coli has a vital role in viral spread and virulence of H9N2 AIV [23] . On the other hand, it is well known that the hemagglutinin glycoprotein for influenza viruses is produced as a precursor, HA0, which requires cleavage by host proteases before it is functional and virus particles are infectious [24] . The HA0 precursor proteins of AIVs of low virulence for poultry have a single arginine at the cleavage site and another at position \u22124. These viruses are restricted to cleavage by host proteases such as trypsin-like enzymes and thus limited to replication at sites in the host where such enzymes are found, i.e., the respiratory and intestinal tracts [25, 26] . HPAI viruses have multiple basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) at their HA0 cleavage sites [1, 27, 28] and appear to be cleavable by ubiquitous proteases. These viruses are able to replicate and spread throughout the bird, damaging vital organs and tissues which results in disease and death [24] . Indeed, trypsin-like proteases are essential for the cleavage activation of the HA and so play a vital role in viral pathogenicity [29, 30] .",

There are several reports on kidney lesions in chickens infected with low pathogenic AIVs [31, 32, 34] . Focal and diffuse interstitial lymphocyte infiltration observed and indicated that the kidney has the potential for survival of the virus. Significant changes were observed in spleen, and according to Swayne and Slemons [35] , such changes in the spleen could be as the result of the host immune response to H9N2 AIV. Trachea showed prominent severe lesions, and similar findings were observed by others where more cell injuries in the tissues of respiratory system and GIT were recorded [36] . The presence of trypsin-like enzyme may be the cause of cleavage of the HA protein of LP AIV and the coinfection of the virus with live IBV vaccine indicates that live IBV vaccine increases the replication of H9N2 AIV and its spread in the tissues [8] .",

Furthermore, live IBV vaccine coinfection may have provided the protease enzymes and enhanced H9N2 AIV pathogenicity in this study as it has been reported that a trypsin-like serine protease domain is encoded by coronavirus IBV [40, 41] .

Interference between live NDV vaccine and H9N2 AIV explained the reduction of NDV titer in Groups 5 and 6 in the second experiment while NDV titer was significantly higher in Group 7. Histopathological studies in experiment 2 revealed that the infection with H9N2 AIV in birds vaccinated with live NDV alone induces mild lesions. Meanwhile, infection with H9N2 AIV in birds vaccinated with both live IBV and NDV vaccines induced severe lesions in all collected internal organs and these results indicated that live NDV vaccine has no significant effect on the severity of H9N2 AIV [46] . Results of rRT-PCR with virus titration in egg in experiment 2 revealed that in the group infected with H9N2 AIV and vaccinated with live NDV vaccine, virus shedding was interfered when compared with the group infected with H9N2 AIV and vaccinated with both live IBV and NDV vaccines. These results are in consistent with the previous reports [45] which stated that coinfection of LPAIV and NDV resulted in low number of cloacal swabs in which both viruses were detected; therefore, coinfection affected the replication dynamics of these viruses. The results are also consistent with other reports [47] which demonstrated that chicken infected with LPAIV and coinfected with NDV showed mild clinical signs and moderate inflammation in the epithelia of the nasal trachea and air sacs, and the LPAIV shedding patterns were affected in chickens exposed to LPAIV and NDV.",
