In these definitions a screening swab refers to a routine swab of the nose and any additional potential MRSA carriage sites that were swabbed at the same time (usually the axillae and perineum, and from November 2004 also the rectum and throat). Patient isolate refers to any clinical isolate taken directly from a patient (including blood, sputum, pus, pleural fluid, wound swab, line tip swab, drain fluid, skin swab) and screening swabs. The above criteria were applied by the infection control team throughout the course of the study period, and retrospectively checked for consistency by comparison with a database of all swabs and clinical isolates taken while patients were in one of the ICUs during the study period. Since the day but not the time of ICU admission and of clinical isolates were recorded in the database, it was assumed that MRSA isolates taken either one or two days after ICU admission were taken within 48 hours of admission. These checks led to changes in the MRSA status of 50 out of 4570 (1.1%) patient episodes and account for the slight discrepancies in the number of acquisitions reported here and elsewhere [1] .",
