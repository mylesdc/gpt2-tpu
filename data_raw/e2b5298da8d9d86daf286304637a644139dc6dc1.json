This study examined the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by measuring the expression of antiviral genes-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1)-in G6PD-knockdown cells upon human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the promoter activities of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 were downregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells, and that the I\u03baB degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB were decreased. The HSCARG protein, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) sensor and negative regulator of NF-\u03baB, was upregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells with decreased NADPH/NADP + ratio. Treatment of G6PD-knockdown cells with siRNA against HSCARG enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB and the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1, but suppressed the expression of viral genes; however, the overexpression of HSCARG inhibited the antiviral response. Exogenous G6PD or IDH1 expression inhibited the expression of HSCARG, resulting in increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 and reduced viral gene expression upon virus infection. Our findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of the G6PD-knockdown cells to viral infection was due to impaired NF-\u03baB signaling and antiviral response mediated by HSCARG.",

G6PD-knockdown cells exhibit premature senescence, growth retardation, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis [4] [5] [6] . Clinically, in addition to the classical association with hemolytic anemia [7, 8] , patients with G6PD-deficiency have an increased risk of degenerative diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] . G6PD-deficient cells are more susceptible to enterovirus, coronavirus, and dengue virus infections [13] [14] [15] . These findings suggest that the G6PD status, and hence the redox environment, is a risk factor for viral infection. The mechanism underlying the effect of the redox environment on viral replication remains elusive.",

The replication and spread normally involves activation of the antiviral innate immune responses and culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [16] and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [17, 18] . Both IFNs and TNF-\u03b1 are antiviral cytokines and display strong antiviral activity in host innate immunity [19] . Type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines produced during the innate immune responses to viral infections, and upregulate antiviral proteins [20] [21] [22] . More than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are initiated by type I IFN signaling, have been discovered. Some ISG-encoded proteins, such as GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [23], protein kinase R (PKR) [24], and 2 1 -5 1 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [25] , are implicated in the antiviral state.",

Because of the crucial role of G6PD in maintaining cellular NADPH/NADP + , examining the relationship among the G6PD status, HSCARG, and host innate immune response is worthwhile.",

The expression of viral genes is substantially higher in G6PD-knockdown cells infected with human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) and EV71 than in infected control cells. The expression of antiviral genes, such as MX1 and TNF-\u03b1, is upregulated, albeit to lower levels, in G6PD deficient cells. HSCARG, whose expression is enhanced in G6PD-deficient cells, inhibits I\u03baB degradation and the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. Exogenous G6PD or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which increases cellular NADPH/NADP + , restores NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral response. These findings demonstrate that G6PD activity, and hence NADPH/NADP + status, can affect antiviral immunity through the modulation of HSCARG and the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade.",

The expression of G6PD was significantly reduced in A549-Gi cells compared with the A549-Sc cells ( Figure 1A The discrepancy between the viral replication in normal cells and G6PD-deficient cells correlates with their antiviral gene expression. Numerous antiviral genes were found to be upregulated in the A549 and MRC-5 cells after infection with HCoV-229E (Table 1 ). The expression of the antiviral genes TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 was studied in the infected A549-Gi and A549-Sc cells. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels increased more than 400-fold in the A549-Sc cells at 2 h p.i., and returned to the original levels at 8 h p.i. ( Figure 1C ). The induction level was considerably lower in the A549-Gi cells, with the mRNA levels showing only a 250-fold increase at 2 h p.i. ( Figure 1C , white bars). Likewise, the expression of the MX1 gene increased during the infection course of HCoV-229E, and was significantly higher in the A549-Sc cells than in the A549-Gi cells ( Figure 1D ). The level of MX1 mRNA increased over 22.8-fold at 2 h p.i. and 774.2-fold at 8 h p.i in the A549-Sc cells ( Figure 1D) . However, the level of induction was also reduced by 40% at 2 h p.i. and by 28% at 8 h p.i in the A549-Gi cells. The difference in inducibility of antiviral genes in control versus G6PD-deficient cells was observed in the case of EV71 infection, which increased TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 expression in RD cells (Table S2 and Figure S1 ). The expression of TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure S1B ) and MX1 ( Figure S1C ) genes in G6PD-knockdown RD-Gi cells was significantly lower than in RD-Sc cells. Furthermore, G6PD-knockdown increased the susceptibility to EV71 infection ( Figure S1A , right panel; G6PD protein expression was shown in the left panel). These findings suggest that the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 is suppressed in G6PD-deficient cells.",

Pretreatment of the A549 cells with siRNA against TNF-\u03b1 significantly reduced HCoV-229E-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression throughout the course of infection ( Figure 2A ).

The modest increase in the promoter activity of the MX1 gene raises doubt concerning the involvement of NF-\u03baB in MX1 promoter regulation. Various reporter vectors containing a luciferase gene linked to various forms of MX1 gene promoter were constructed, and their activities were examined in the infected cells. The construct MX1P had the wild-type MX1 gene promoter, while the constructs MX1D and MX1M had no binding sites or had mutant NF-\u03baB binding sites ( Figure 4A ). HCoV-229E induced significant induction of the MX1P luciferase construct ( Figure 4B ). By contrast, the luciferase activity of MX1D and MX1M upon HCoV-229E infection was not significantly different from the uninfected control. These findings suggest that NF-\u03baB plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of the MX1 gene. ",

Treatment with HSCARG siRNA increases the antiviral response and reduces the viral replication in G6PD-knockdown cells. It is likely that G6PD deficiency impairs the cellular capacity to produce NADPH, thus enhancing HSCARG expression and its nuclear translocation. In addition, the exogenous expression of IDH1 is inhibitory to HSCARG expression. Therefore, it is conceivable that HSCARG suppresses NF-\u03baB activity via modulation of I\u03baB phosphorylation/degradation, leading to reduction in the expression of antiviral genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and MX1. This reasoning may account in part for the increased susceptibility of cells to coronavirus or enterovirus. Our findings suggest that the redox status may regulate the antiviral response and viral replication via the HSCARG-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

Certain clinical findings regarding individuals with G6PD-deficiency are compelling: They develop symptoms (e.g., hemolysis and pancreatitis) that are more severe after infection with the hepatitis E virus [60, 61] , they are more susceptible to dengue virus type 2 infection than normal subjects [15] , and they develop severe pneumonia symptoms after microbial infection [62, 63] . Redox imbalance may account for the impairment of antiviral immunity in patients with G6PD-deficiency.

Drug-induced cytotoxicity in G6PD-deficient cells is normally attributed to their reduced ability to regenerate NADPH and glutathione [4, 44, 65] . Deficit of NADPH can also lead to reduced NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide generation [66] . Increased superoxide generation by NADPH oxidases in diabetic mice is associated with increased G6PD activity [67] . The correlation between superoxide generation and G6PD activity has been observed in such pathophysiological situations as liver hypertrophy [68] , and cardiovascular dysfunction [69] . Likewise, nitric oxide production can be affected [70] . However, the interplay between antioxidative (i.e., NADPH production and maintenance of endogenous antioxidants) and pro-oxidative (i.e., NADPH and superoxide production) roles of G6PD may be more complicated than previously thought. For instance, G6PD-deficient granulocytes have an impaired ability to generate superoxide, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide [71] . On the other hand, G6PD-deficient neutrophils show increased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production [72] . More studies are needed to solve such a riddle.",
