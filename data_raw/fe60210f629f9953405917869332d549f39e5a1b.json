SARS and related coronaviruses and astroviruses all possess a motif at the 39 end of their RNA genomes, called the s2m, whose pathogenic importance is inferred from its rigorous sequence conservation in an otherwise rapidly mutable RNA genome. We find that this extreme conservation is clearly explained by the requirement to form a highly structured RNA whose unique tertiary structure includes a sharp 908 kink of the helix axis and several novel longer-range tertiary interactions. The tertiary base interactions create a tunnel that runs perpendicular to the main helical axis whose interior is negatively charged and binds two magnesium ions. These unusual features likely form interaction surfaces with conserved host cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. Based on its conservation in viral pathogen genomes and its absence in the human genome, we suggest that these unusual structural features in the s2m RNA element are attractive targets for the design of anti-viral therapeutic agents. Structural genomics has sought to deduce protein function based on three-dimensional homology.",

The viral replicase is translated directly from the genomic sense-strand RNA, and it then creates a full-length complementary (minus-sense strand) copy of the genomic RNA, as well as a nested set of shorter, subgenomic mRNAs having common 39 UTRs. These 39 UTRs all share with the genomic SARS RNA a 32-nucleotide element, immediately upstream of the 39 poly-A tail (residues 29,590-29,621) [1] , originally termed the stem-loop II motif (s2m) in human astroviruses [2] .

However, it is also imperative to identify and to elucidate the three-dimensional structures of non-protein gene products, including the various RNAs required for mRNA processing, protein synthesis, and other cellular functions [4] . In the case of viruses that possess an RNA genome, including such pathogens as HIV and SARS, it becomes critical to expand the scope of structural genomics analyses even further to include biologically relevant RNA tertiary interactions that occur within the RNA genome itself. Those genomic RNA elements having the greatest degree of conservation are the most likely to be crucial to the evolution, growth, and replication of these viruses, and therefore demand the most attention from those seeking to understand RNA viral pathogenesis and to design appropriate anti-viral drugs.",

The structure reveals a dramatic 908 bend and several additional novel tertiary interactions. Although the sequence and three-dimensional structure of the s2m RNA are both unique, comparison of the global fold of the SARS s2m RNA to known RNA tertiary structures reveals that the backbone fold of the s2m RNA mimics that of the 530 loop of 16S rRNA, permitting us to hypothesize that the biological function of s2m in SARS and related viruses is based upon macromolecular mimicry of this region of ribosomal RNA. The ribosomal RNA 530 loop and the proteins that bind to it are involved in translational initiation, suggesting that the role of the s2m in SARS may also involve translation initiation. Specifically, we propose, based on structural homology arguments, that the SARS s2m RNA might bind to the host's eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (eIF-1A) to hijack the host's translational machinery for use by the virus, or to bind other translational regulation proteins having similar folds for similar purposes.",

In addition, we analyzed 38 sequenced SARS variants and found that the motif is absolutely conserved within all of them. No insertions or deletions appear to be tolerated, indicating that this region forms a highly conserved RNA tertiary structure that is universally required for viral function [1, 2, 5] .",

We solved the crystal structure to 2.7-\u00c5 resolution using a single platinum isomorphous/anomalous derivative and obtained a readily interpretable solvent-flattened electron density map ( Figures 1B-1D and 2A ). The quality of the electron density enabled us to fit the s2m RNA sequence unambiguously to the map and to build a model of the unusual tertiary structure. The initial map was virtually indistinguishable from the final 3Fo-2Fc map calculated using phases from the refined RNA structure, indicating that the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) experimental phases initially obtained were quite accurate (Tables 1 and 2) . Two well-ordered hydrated Mg 2\u00fe complexes bound to the phosphate backbone of the RNA are also readily observable in the initial electron density map ( Figure 2B ). RNA sequences from various coronavirus and astrovirus species. The SARS RNA sequence is color-coded to match the color scheme used throughout.

            "text": "The overall structure of the s2m SARS RNA consists of two regions that are defined by two perpendicular RNA helix axes (see Figures 1 and 2) . The larger region contains several nonhelical motifs involved in long-range tertiary contacts (see Figure 3 ). The smaller region (residues 20-30, shown in yellow in Figure 3 ) forms a stem-loop structure in which a pentaloop (residues [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] is structured similar to a conventional GNRA tetraloop motif but has an extra residue (U [25] ) bulged out of the stack formed by A(23), G(24), A (26) , and the augmenting helical stem (residues 20-21 and 27-28). This is similar to what is observed in a spliceosomal stem-loop structure [6] . The base of U(25) is disordered in the structure, and little side-chain density is apparent in an otherwise well-defined electron density map. Residues 29 and 30 are unpaired and are involved in forming a rather severe backbone reversal that accompanies the 908 kink in the helix axis. The 5 ] 2\u00fe complex ions, depicted as white octahedra, bind to the pro-R and pro-S phosphate oxygen atoms of A (12) .

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030005.t002 phylogenetic comparisons shown in Figure 1A reveal that the pentaloop sequence is highly conserved. Although the structure of the pentaloop is very similar to the standard GNRA tetraloop structure [7, 8] , the ''extra'' U(25) insertion between R and A is always present. The unusual perpendicular helical junction is stabilized by the formation of an RNA base quartet involving two adjacent G-C pairs wherein the G(19)/C(31) pair shares four hydrogen bonds with the C(20)/ G(28) pair (shown as pink dotted lines in Figure 3A and 3B). The RNA sequences required to preserve these G-C pair interactions are present in all but one of the viral sequences analyzed (avian nephritis virus), implying that the base quartet serves a significant structural role in SARS and most related viruses. All previously characterized RNA base quartets are purine tetrads [9,10,11,12,13,14,15] and do not occur within double-helical structures; the G-C quartet thus appears to be another novel structural feature present within the s2m element of SARS and related viruses.",

A base triple forms between A(38) and this G-C pair, a variant of the adenosine platform motif [16] , and consequently G(11) and A(12) are rotated out of the helical structure completely. A(33) forms long-range tertiary interactions with G(11) and A(12) by hydrogen bonding to the N3 of G(11) and the ribose of A (12) . Substitutions at position 12 are thus tolerated, as is a single instance of purine substitution at position 11 (which will preserve the N3 hydrogen-bonding interaction with A [12] ). Together, these interactions superficially resemble those observed in domain IV of 4.5S RNA of the signal recognition particle [17, 18] , but the structural details are completely different. G(11), A(12), and A(33), despite their extrusion from the helical base-pair stack, form a well-defined structure that is highly ordered, judging by electron density in the initial map as well as the comparatively low temperature factors these residues have in the refined structure. They conspire with the remaining residues in the asymmetric bubble and the helical region above it to form a rather wide tunnel whose channel runs approximately perpendicular to the main helical axis. The phosphates of G(11) and A(12) are turned inward, creating a negatively charged environment within the tunnel cavity. Consequently, the tunnel forms a binding site for two [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2\u00fe ions in the native structure (see Figure 2B ), and the tunnel is also the binding site for cis-[(NH 3 ) 2 Cl 2 Pt(IV)] 2\u00fe and [Ru(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3\u00fe metal complexes that were introduced for heavy atom isomorphous replacement phasing. These highly structured and rigorously conserved features allow us to suggest that SARS pathogenesis might be inhibited by a drug designed to bind to s2m and disrupt one of these structures.",

The results are consistent with the crystal structure, and in some cases enable us to verify that longrange tertiary interactions observed in the crystal structure also occur in solution. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) modification patterns ( Figure 4A ) of the N1 atomic position of A and the N3 of C residues are consistent with the observed fold in the crystal structure ( Figure 4B) . A and C residues that are solvent-exposed in the tertiary structure, such as A(12), A(23), and C (27) , are among the most heavily modified by DMS (along with A [44] and A [45] near the helical terminus). These modification sites are shown as red spheres in Figure 4B . Although A(33) is quite exposed in the tertiary structure, the N1 is protected from modification by DMS (shown as a green sphere in Figure 4B ), consistent with the involvement of the N1 of A(33) in a 2.8-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the exocyclic N2 of G(11) (white atom and dotted line in Figure 4B ) in the crystal structure. We therefore conclude that this tertiary structural interaction observed in crystals of s2m RNA is likely to be quite similar to what occurs in solution. G(11) is the only G residue of the s2m RNA detectably modified by kethoxal (data not shown), which reacts with nitrogens at the N1 and N2 positions. The N1 modification site is highlighted as an orange sphere and is consistent with the observed tertiary structure formed by G(11), A(12), and A(33) that exposes G(11) to the solvent. U(30) is solvent-exposed in the crystal structure and is reactive to 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT; magenta spheres in Figure 4B ; data not shown), as are the nonconserved 39-terminal uridines (probably due to helix fraying in solution). U(25), which is not well ordered in the crystal but which we expect is also solvent-exposed, appears not to be reactive.",

We believe this to be improbable because of the energetically unfavorable tertiary structures that would be required to form from the sequence complement. For example, the variant of the energetically stable and rather common GNRA loop structure (GAGUA) would have to be replaced with an energetically unstable and rare CUCAU loop.

This effect is sometimes observed for small stemloop sequences, which often crystallize as duplex dimers rather than as monomeric hairpins. The s2m RNA structure is sufficiently large, and apparently contains enough stabilizing secondary and tertiary interactions, to offset any energetic advantage that might come from crystallizing as a duplex. In addition, the 73% solvent content of the s2m RNA crystals ensures that most of the crystallized RNA is solvent-exposed, rather than involved in extensive packing interactions. At least three inter-molecular contacts are required to form a crystal. The most extensive contact is the base of residue G(11); it stacks upon that of its 2-fold symmetry mate ( Figure   4C ). It is likely that these nucleotide bases become oriented in such a way as to optimize this stacking interaction. The nonessential nucleotide G(1) forms a weak (3.4-\u00c5 ) hydrogenbonding interaction with A(29) of an adjacent molecule, but most of this packing interaction appears to be due to shape is the most disordered residue in the structure and has the highest temperature factor.

Our analysis of the human genome, other animal and viral genomes, and the currently available database of RNA three-dimensional structures revealed that the s2m element is found only in astroviruses and coronaviruses; no cellular homologs are immediately apparent. The G(11) to A(33) tertiary contact in the s2m RNA is homologous to the G(1,452) to A(1,486) contact in Domain III of the 23S ribosomal RNA, but the context of the interaction in the ribosome is completely different, and the sequence is not conserved between Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus. However, if we relax the sequence constraints and focus attention upon the conformation of the RNA backbone, we find that the phosphodiester backbone fold accompanying the 908 kink in s2m RNA mimics that found in the 530 stemloop of 16S ribosomal RNA [19] ( Figure 5A ). The latter binds to the S12 protein found at the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits. The 530 stem-loop, and the S12 protein that binds to it, have been implicated in EF-Gindependent ribosomal translocation [20] . Remarkably, superposition of the s2m RNA upon the 530 stem-loop within the 30S ribosome in which prokaryotic initiation factor 1 (IF-1) has been added [21] reveals plausible modes of s2m RNA binding to both the S12 protein and to IF-1 ( Figure  5B ). Both S12 and IF-1 have eukaryotic homologs; the structure of IF-1 and its eukaryotic analog, eIF-1A, possess almost identical RNA oligomer binding (OB) folds [22, 23] .",

            "text": "The s2m RNA Tunnel Is an Attractive Target for the Design of Anti-SARS Drugs Figure 3C and 3D dramatically illustrates the most striking and unique structural feature within the SARS s2m RNA. A tunnel is created by the tertiary contacts between A(33) of the purine asymmetric bulge (red), G(11) and A(12) of the sevennucleotide bubble (green), and the helical region between them (purple). The non-bridging phosphate oxygens of G(11) and A(12) line the surface of the cavity, creating a negatively charged region into which Mg 2\u00fe ions are observed to bind. It is likely that in the context of the virus, this invariant feature of the s2m structure is involved in binding interactions with highly conserved proteins or other components of the host cell that interact specifically with the negatively charged cavity. Because this tunnel structure is unique to coronaviruses and astroviruses and because the sequence comprising this structure is invariant, it is reasonable to propose that by designing a drug that specifically targets this structural feature and binds tightly to it, an anti-SARS therapeutic might be obtained that avoids the pitfall of being toxic to uninfected host cells while escaping the usual problem of drug resistance that develops in rapidly mutating RNA viruses.",

            "text": "Crystals of a 48-nucleotide T7 RNA transcript containing the conserved s2m RNA element were obtained via hanging-drop vapor diffusion by equilibrating a solution containing equal volumes of the RNA sample and the reservoir solution against 1-ml of the reservoir solution. The RNA sample solution contained 4.5 mg/ml s2m RNA dissolved in 30 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mM NaCl, and 60 mM MgCl 2 . The reservoir solution contained 50 mM MES (pH 5.6), 100 mM Mg(OAc) 2 , and 20% MPD. Data from a native crystal diffracting to 2.7-\u00c5 resolution, and 3.0-\u00c5 cis-(NH 3 ) 2 (Cl) 2 Pt(IV)-derivative single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data, were collected at Beamline 9.1 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on a 3 3 3 CCD detector using 0.98-\u00c5 wavelength X rays and crystals that were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution spiked with 12% glycerol and maintained at 100 K. The native and platinum derivative data were processed using CCP4's MOSFLM and reduced and scaled within CCP4 version 5.0 [32, 33] . A single platinum heavy atom site was found in both isomorphous-and anomalous-differences Patterson-map Harker sections calculated using data from 10-to 5-\u00c5 resolution. Phase calculation, solvent flattening, phase extension, and simulated annealing refinement were carried out within CNS version 1.1 [34] . The initial SIRAS map was uninterruptible in spacegroup P6 1 22 but was unambiguous in P6 5 22 , permitting the hand of the space group to be determined. A 47-nucleotide poly-C model was built into the SIRAS map using O, the actual nucleotide-sequence register was then confirmed by inspecting the electron density, and residues 1-47 were built in using O [35] . The phosphate for residue 48 is clearly present in the electron density map, but the density for the remainder of U(48), as well as that for the bases of U(25) and U (30) , was rather disordered. The final refinement was performed using CCP4's refmac [36] , and the figures were produced using MacPymol [37] . All crystallographic computations were performed on the Mac OS X platform. Details of data processing, phasing, and refinement are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The crystal structure of the SARS s2m RNA was compared to others in the RCSB Protein Data Bank using the program MC-Annotate [38, 39] and by visual inspection. Sequence comparisons prior to obtaining the s2m tertiary structure were performed using the UCSC Genome Browser [40] , and were subsequently supplemented with tertiary constraints imposed by the crystal structure using the programs PatScan [41] and RNABOB [42, 43] . Transcripts containing s2m for solution structure analysis were prepared using plasmid templates cleaved downstream, so that the s2m element was present at the 59 end of the transcript and contained an RNA tail consisting of plasmid sequences. Chemical probing experiments were carried out according to established methods [44] . Primer extension was performed as described previously [45] using a primer complementary to sequences 39 of the s2m element.",

(B) The IF-1 (magenta) and S12 protein (blue) that bind to the 16S rRNA 530 loop (now hidden) are shown relative to the same s2m RNA superposition, suggesting that their eukaryotic homologs might plausibly bind to the s2m RNA.

The experiments were conceived, designed, and interpreted in a cooperative effort among all of the authors. MPR and WGS determined the crystal structure and investigated possible structural homologies. HI and MA designed the transcription templates for the SARS s2m RNA and performed the biochemical analyses. RB and DH performed the viral and cellular genomic sequence analyses and called our attention to the striking conservation and biological importance of the SARS s2m RNA.",
