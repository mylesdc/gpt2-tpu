As a result, it is possible to quantitate single DNA target molecules. We utilize the digital array, which is a novel nanofluidic biochip [2, 3] where digital PCR reactions can be performed ( Figure 1 ) by partitioning DNA molecules, instead of diluting them. This chip utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and reagents into 765 nanolitre volume reaction chambers. DNA molecules in each mixture are randomly partitioned into the 765 chambers of each panel (the total volume of the PCR mix in each panel: 6 nl6765 = 4.59 ml). The chip is then thermocycled and imaged on Fluidigm's BioMark real-time PCR system and the positive chambers that originally contained 1 or more molecules can be counted by the digital array analysis software ( Figure 2 ).",

Given the number of molecules per panel and the dilution factor, the concentration of the target sequence in a DNA sample can be accurately calculated. In a multiplex PCR reaction with 2 or more assays, multiple genes can be quantitated simultaneously and independently, effectively eliminating any pipetting errors if separate reactions have to be set up for different genes. When a single copy reference gene (RNase P in this study, [10] ) is used in the reaction, the ratio of the target gene to the reference gene would reflect the copy number per haploid genome of the target gene. Primary contribution of this paper In this paper we will show that the digital array provides a robust and easy-to-use platform to study CNVs. We have derived a mathematical framework to calculate the true concentration of molecules from the observed positive reactions in a panel. We also show how to perform statistical analysis to find the 95% confidence intervals of the true concentrations and the ratio of two concentrations in a CNV experiment using the digital array with multiplex PCR.",

As the number of panels P increases, then the number of chambers C = 765 Pincreases and therefore the estimation of the ratio becomes more accurate as well as the confidence interval shrinks. When only 1 panel is used, there is significant overlap between 95% confidence intervals of certain ratios e.g. between ratio 2 and 2.5. There is no overlap when 3 or more panels are used. In all cases the known ratio lies within the computed 95% confidence interval. Note that using mathematical analysis one can find optimal numbers of positive chambers for each ratio which give smallest confidence intervals and which will therefore improve the results.",

The solution is an elegant application of statistical sampling and estimation theories to such an important real-world Table 2 . Given number of chambers C and counts H 1 and H 2 of the positive chambers in a digital array for the target gene and the reference gene, respectively, list of formulas needed to analyze copy number variation. problem.

Thermocycling conditions included a 95uC, 10 minute hot start followed by 40 cycles of two-step PCR: 15 seconds at 95uC for denaturing and 1 minute at 60uC for annealing and extension. Molecules of the two genes were independently amplified. FAM and VIC signals of all chambers were recorded at the end of each PCR cycle.
