Analysis of the receptor-binding properties of this virus using a recombinant protein approach in combination with fetuin-binding, glycan array and human tissue-binding assays demonstrates increased binding of H7 to both a2-6 and a2-8 sialosides as well as reduced binding to a2-3-linked SIAs compared to a closely related avian H7N9 virus from 2008. These differences could be attributed to substitutions Q226L and G186V. Analysis of the enzymatic activity of the neuraminidase N9 protein indicated a reduced sialidase activity, consistent with the reduced binding of H7 to a2-3 sialosides. However, the novel H7N9 virus still preferred binding to a2-3over a2-6-linked SIAs and was not able to efficiently bind to epithelial cells of human trachea in contrast to seasonal IAV, consistent with its limited human-to-human transmission.",

The new human H7N9 virus is a reassortant virus that acquired its hemagglutinin (HA) subtype 7 (H7) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype 9 (N9) gene segments as well as the other gene segments from (different) avian IAVs [1] [2] [3] . Analysis of the gene sequences indicates that the novel H7N9 viruses may be better adapted to infect humans than other avian influenza A viruses. H7N9 viruses isolated from human possess for instance the E627K substitution in the PB2 RNA polymerase subunit, which has been shown to facilitate RNA replication in mammalian cells [4] [5] [6] and transmission between ferrets 7 .",

The HA receptor binding site is formed by three structural elements that comprise the 130 loop (residues 133-138), the 190 helix (residues 190-198) , and the 220 loop (residues 220-229) 10 . While avian viruses in general contain a glutamine at position 226 (H3 numbering), the human H7N9 virus has a leucine residue at this position. This amino acid substitution has been associated with reduced binding of avian receptors (a2,3-linked SIAs), increased binding of mammalian-like receptors (a2,6-linked SIAs) 8, 11, 12 , and with airborne transmission of H5N1 virus between ferrets 7,13 .",

Although not much is known about the determinants of NA substrate specificity, it is generally accepted that the activity of NA needs to match the activity of HA to achieve efficient viral infection and replication [15] [16] [17] [18] .

In the present study, we compared the receptor-binding and enzymatic properties of the HA and NA proteins of the human H7N9 virus from 2013 with a closely related avian H7N9 virus. The results indicate that the novel H7N9 viruses have acquired the ability to bind to humanlike receptors, for which substitutions at position 186 and 226 are responsible. These mutations are not only found in most novel human H7N9 viruses but are also found in the majority of novel avian H7N9 IAVs. Fortunately, however, the novel H7N9 viruses have not (yet) a receptor-binding profile resembling that of seasonal IAVs and are also not able to bind to the human tracheal epithelium. These results are in agreement with the limited spread of the novel H7N9 viruses between humans.",

A similar approach 22 was used to compare the properties of the N9 proteins of these two viruses (referred to as human and teal N9). The recombinant protein approach renders the use of viruses, which results in obvious biosafety issues, superfluous. Recent studies have shown the potential of recombinant soluble oligomeric HA (sHA 3 ) and NA (sNA 4 ) proteins to study the receptor-binding properties of HA and the enzymatic activity of NA 17, 20, 21 . The genetic distance between the human and teal HA and NA proteins is shown in supplementary Fig. S1 . The teal H7N9 virus is one of the closest relatives of the novel H7N9 viruses that contains both the H7 and the N9 genes. This was also exemplified by a protein blast search with the human H7 and N9 proteins, in which the teal H7 and N9 proteins were the first hits that are derived from a H7N9 virus sequenced prior to 2013. Comparison of functional pairs of HA and NA proteins of the teal and human H7N9 viruses not only allows us to study and compare the receptor-binding properties and enzymatic activities of H7 and N9 proteins derived from different hosts, but also to study the functional relationship between these complementary proteins.",

Fetuin contains mono-, bi-, and tri-antennary glycans carrying both a2-3 and a2-6 SIAs 23 . Binding of HA to fetuin was detected both for the teal and human H7 proteins, albeit with different efficiencies (Fig. 1A) . The binding of the human H7 protein was significantly less efficient than that of the teal H7 protein (Fig. 1B) . For comparison, the H5 (derived from an avian H5N1 virus) and H1 (derived from a seasonal human H1N1 virus) proteins, which were previously shown to specifically bind to a2-3 and a2-6 SIAs, respectively 21, 24 , were also included. Binding of H5 to fetuin was more efficient than that of the H1 protein, which displayed similar binding to fetuin as the human H7 protein. We also analyzed the ability of the different recombinant proteins using hemagglutination assays with chicken, human or horse erythrocytes. (supplementary Fig. S2 ). The human H7 protein agglutinated both human and chicken erythrocytes, but to a lesser extent than the teal H7 or the H5 protein. The human H7 protein did not agglutinate horse erythrocytes. The H1 protein only showed appreciable agglutination of human erythrocytes. These results show that the human and teal H7 proteins have different receptor-binding properties. Whether this also reflects a difference in binding specificity (a2-3 versus alpha a2-6 SIA) will be addressed below. Furthermore, the hemagglutination assays indicate differences in receptor binding between the human H7 and H1 proteins.",

Most mutations had little effect on the ability of the teal H7 protein to bind to fetuin. One mutation caused a modest but significant increase (G186V) in fetuin binding, while another mutation (Q226L) severely decreased the binding of the H7 protein ( Fig. 3A and supplementary Fig. S4 ). Next, we tested different combinations of mutations. In general, amino acid substitutions in addition to those at position 186 or 226 did not affect the fetuin-binding properties of the resulting proteins much compared to the 186 and 226 single mutant proteins. Only when the mutations at position 186 and 226 were combined was a fetuin-binding phenotype similar to that of the human H7 protein observed. (Fig. 3B and supplementary Fig. S4 ). Binding of this double mutant protein was significantly higher than that of the Q226L single mutant protein (P , 0.001). Introduction of two additional substitutions in the H7 protein already carrying both G186V and Q226L did not significantly affect fetuin binding compared to the G186V and Q226L double mutant. In agreement with the important role for the residues at position 186 and 226 in the teal protein for fetuin binding, reciprocal substitutions at positions 186 and 226 in the background of the human H7 protein resulted in significantly decreased (V186G) and increased (L226Q) fetuin binding ( Fig. 3C and supplementary Fig. S4 ). Thus, single substitutions at position 186 and 226 in the background of the human H7 protein are sufficient to obtain fetuin-binding properties that are similar to single mutant teal proteins (compare H7/Human L226Q with H7/Teal G186V [P . 0.7] and H7/Human V186G with H7/Teal Q226L [P . 0.3]). In general, the fetuin-binding properties of the recombinant proteins correlated with the ability of these proteins to agglutinate red blood cells (supplementary Fig. S2 ). Although we cannot exclude that other substitutions may also affect fetuin binding, we conclude that the differences in fetuin binding between the human and teal H7 proteins can be mostly attributed to substitutions at position 186 and 226.",

These human viruses are also able to bind to cells of the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Viruses that prefer binding to a2-3 SIAs are able to bind to cells of the LRT, because of the presence of a2-3 SIAs in the LRT, but not to the epithelial cells of the URT. Indeed, comparable results were obtained by performing recombinant HA histochemistry on human tissues using the H1 and the H5 protein (Fig. 5) . The H1/Kentucky protein of the seasonal influenza virus, which was previously shown by microarray analysis to bind to a2-6 SIAs only 21 , displayed efficient binding to the cilia of the human trachea epithelium. In the lung, the H1 protein bound to the ciliated epithelium of the bronchiole and to type I pneumocytes. In contrast, the H5 protein, which only binds to a2-3 SIAs 24 , did not demonstrate appreciable binding to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea, although efficient binding to submucosal glands was observed. In the LRT, the H5 protein displayed binding to the cilia of the bronchiole, to type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5 ) and occasionally to macrophages (data not shown). The teal H7 protein showed a similar binding pattern as the H5 protein and bound to submucosal glands and type II pneumocytes, consistent with the expression of a2-3 sialosides on these cells 27 . In contrast, the human H7 protein only showed efficient binding to the submucosal glands. Hardly any binding was observed to the cilia of the bronchiole and to pneumocytes, in agreement with the reduced receptor-binding avidity of this protein.

            "text": "Pandemics of influenza A virus are caused by viruses that suddenly appear from animal reservoirs, to which most humans have no immunity and which are able to efficiently transmit between humans. A prerequisite for efficient human-to-human transmission is the ability of the virus to specifically bind to a2-6-linked SIAs present in the upper respiratory tract. In view of the concerns raised by the novel human H7N9 virus we analyzed the receptor binding properties of this virus. The results indicate that, in comparison to avian H7N9 virus, the human H7N9 virus displays increased binding to a2-6 as well as a2-8 sialosides and reduced binding to a2-3-linked SIAs. Still, whereas all seasonal/pandemic IAVs bind more efficiently to a2-6than to a2-3-linked sialosides, the human H7 protein binds more efficiently to a2-3than a2-6-linked SIAs and is not able to efficiently bind to epithelial cells of human trachea. From these results we conclude that the human H7N9 virus has not (yet) adapted its HA protein to such an extent that it results in a receptor-binding profile similar to that of pandemic/seasonal IAV. Our results are in agreement with recent studies that use recombinant H7 proteins to study the ability of the H7N9 viruses to interact with sialosides or to bind to human tissues [28] [29] [30] . Also when virions are used for receptorbinding analyses, human H7 viruses display lower avidity for a2-3 sialic acids and a higher avidity for a2-6 sialosides when compared to other avian viruses. In general, binding to a2-6 sialosides appears less than what is observed for human seasonal influenza viruses, which are able to bind to a2-6 but not a2-3 sialosides 30-33 . These results are in agreement with the limited human-to-human transmission and airborne transmission between ferrets of the human H7N9 virus 31, 33, 34 .",

To our knowledge a2-8 sialosides have never been reported to be present on epithelial cells in the respiratory tract or to be able to serve as functional receptors leading to cell entry. Nevertheless, IAVs are likely to encounter a2-8 sialosides present on the molecules described above and thus their potential role as decoy receptor needs to be considered, especially since IAV neuraminidases are not able to cleave a2-8 linkages 35 .",

In agreement with the hypothesis that the activity of NA balances the activity of HA [15] [16] [17] [18] , the human N9 protein was significantly less active than the corresponding teal protein, which could be attributed to a loss in the ability to target a2-3 SIA substrates. Both the teal and the human proteins were equally inefficient in the removal of a2-6 SIA residues. The relative inability of the human N9 protein to remove a2-6 SIA residues may negatively affect the ability of the H7N9 virus to obtain more efficient binding to these human-like receptors as efficient replication of such viruses probably requires adaptive mutations in the NA protein.",

Introduction of the Q226L mutation resulted in severely reduced fetuin binding and in decreased or increased binding of a2-3 and a2-6 sialosides, respectively. The reduced binding to fetuin was compensated by G186V. The observation that a (partial) switch in receptor specificity results in reduced binding of sialosides, which is compensated by mutations at other positions in the HA protein, also appears to occur for other HA proteins. Mutations in H5 required for airborne transmission between ferrets not only include mutations responsible for a switch in receptor specificity, but also the loss of a N-linked glycosylation site at position 158 7, 13 . The loss of this glycosylation site results in enhanced binding of H5 to human-type receptors 41 (de Vries and de Haan, unpublished data).",

Strikingly, almost all novel avian H7N9 viruses already carry the Q226L and G186V mutations, indicating that mutations that increase binding to human-like receptors may be obtained by IAVs in an avian host. The increased ability of such viruses to replicate in humans may promote the acquirement of subsequent substitutions that increase a2-6 binding. Additional mutations, required for a full switch, have been described for H2, H3 and H5 viruses. While human H2 and H3 viruses have obtained the G228S substitution 42 , for H5 an alternative mutation (N224K) may also suffice 13 . A scenario of stepwise development of optimal binding has a precedent in the observed evolution of the H2N2 pandemic. H2N2 viruses isolated from humans during the first year (1957) of the ''Asian'' pandemic had not yet obtained the G228S substitution and show lower avidity towards human-like receptors 42 . Probably, these viruses had not yet acquired the optimal SIA-binding properties for efficient human-to-human transmission. Likewise, the inability of the novel H7N9 viruses to efficiently transmit between humans so far, is probably related with the incomplete switch in receptor specificity that we observed for this virus.",
