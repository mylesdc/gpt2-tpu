Despite improvement of HCV treatment using the novel direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting viral replication, there is a lack of prophylactic measures for protection against HCV infection. Identifying novel antivirals such as those that target viral entry could help broaden the therapeutic arsenal against HCV. Herein, we investigated the anti-HCV activity of the methanolic extract from Rhizoma coptidis (RC), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine documented by the WHO and experimentally reported to possess several pharmacological functions including antiviral effects. Using the cell culture-derived HCV system, we demonstrated that RC dose-dependently inhibited HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. In particular, RC blocked HCV attachment and entry/fusion into the host cells without exerting any significant effect on the cell-free viral particles or modulating key host cell entry factors to HCV. Moreover, RC robustly suppressed HCV pseudoparticles infection of Huh-7.5 cells and impeded infection by several HCV genotypes. Collectively, our results identified RC as a potent antagonist to HCV entry with potential pan-genotypic properties, which deserves further evaluation for use as an anti-HCV agent.",

            "text": "There are over 170 million HCV carriers worldwide. HCV infection can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, and there is still no effective vaccine against the virus. While the previous standard of care consisting of PEGylated-interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 in combination with ribavirin is associated with several important drawbacks including severe side effects and low efficacy against HCV genotype 1, the recent introduction of the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting the viral non-structural proteins has substantially improved the sustained virological response (SVR) in the most difficult to treat genotype 1 patients [6] . However, the DAAs also have challenges including potential toxicity, especially from drug-drug interactions (DDIs). For instance, HCV protease inhibitors are at high risk for DDIs as they are known substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system and can interfere with the metabolism of other drugs including immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus) when co-administered in liver transplant setting [7] . Other drug-drug interactions from HCV DAAs include those with acid-suppression therapies (e.g. famotidine and omeprazole) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral agents (e.g. Rilpivirine and Efavirenz), which have been shown to decrease the effectiveness of the HCV NS5A inhibitor Ledipasvir [8] and produce adverse drug reactions with the protease inhibitor Paritaprevir [7], respectively. In addition, due to the great genetic variability of HCV, selection of resistant mutants is becoming a challenge as a greater number of people are being treated in real-world settings, which can potentially lead to DAA failures [6, 9] . Therefore, continuous identification of novel candidate drugs particularly with a different mode of action to improve the current therapeutic strategies is highly envisaged.",

            "text": "Rhizoma Coptidis (RC) is the dried rhizome typically obtained from Coptis chinensis Franch ('Chinese goldthread'), which is a medicinal plant of the Ranunculaceae family [10]. RC is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs (also known as 'Huang Lian') documented by the WHO [10] and is known to contain various bioactive alkaloids [11] . It is traditionally used for its \"heat clearing\" and \"detoxification\" effects such as treatment against arthritis, burns, eczema, microbial infections, and gastrointestinal diseases [10, 12, 13 ]. In addition, RC's traditional usage against infections has been correlated through several recent studies that validated its antimicrobial functions, including against several bacteria and viruses [13] . Specifically, RC and its major constituents have been shown to exert inhibitory effects against herpesvirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and mouse hepatitis A virus infections [14] [15] [16] . These precedents suggest that RC may be a potent source for the discovery of novel antiviral treatments. Since the effect of RC on HCV infection remains largely unexplored, and in an attempt to identify novel anti-HCV agents, in this study we examined the impact of the methanolic extract of RC on HCV infection. Our results demonstrated that RC could robustly inhibit HCV infection by targeting the early steps in viral entry. Specifically, the targeted steps included viral attachment and entry/fusion into the host cells. In addition, the RC-mediated inhibition of HCV is not genotype-specific as the drug equally inhibits other HCV genotypes, thereby identifying RC as a potential pan-genotypic anti-HCV agent.",

To test whether RC could inactivate the cell-free viral particles, the drug was pre-incubated with the HCVcc for 3 h before dilution and infecting Huh-7.5 cells. The drug-virus mixture was then diluted 20X to yield a non-effective concentration which was subsequently added to the cells and incubated for 3 days. Luciferase readings following 3 days of incubation showed no significant difference between samples treated with or without RC, suggesting that the drug does not impact the free viral particles ( Figure 3A ). To determine the effect of RC on viral attachment, we specifically added RC during HCV cell binding at 4 \u00b0C, which allows for virus binding but precludes viral internalization, and then tested the reporter readout at the end of the incubation. Results demonstrated a significant decrease in the luciferase reporter activity, which indicated that RC interfered with the attachment of the virus to the host cells ( Figure 3A ). To ascertain whether RC influenced the post-attachment viral entry/fusion step, Huh-7.5 cells were prebound with HCV at 4 \u00b0C before shifting the temperature to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of RC. Similar to the effect observed on viral attachment, our data revealed a significant decrease in HCV infectivity at the end of the incubation, suggesting that RC equally blocked HCV entry/fusion ( Figure 3A ).

The drug-virus mixture was then diluted 20X to yield a non-effective concentration which was subsequently added to the cells and incubated for 3 days. Luciferase readings following 3 days of incubation showed no significant difference between samples treated with or without RC, suggesting that the drug does not impact the free viral particles ( Figure 3A ).

Specifically, luciferase-tagged HCVpp were used to infect Huh-7.5 cells in the presence or absence of RC, before further incubating the cells and assessing luciferase reporter activity as a readout of viral infectivity.

Given that RC treatment blocked HCV infection mainly by targeting viral entry, we next asked whether the drug could modulate the expression of key host cells entry factors. To this end, Huh-7.5 cells were pre-treated with RC for 24 h before harvesting the cell lysates for Western blot analysis. As depicted in Figure 3D , pre-treatment of Huh-7.5 cells with RC did not alter the expression of CD81, SR-BI, CLDN-1, and OCLN. Similarly, the expression of ApoE was not affected by RC treatment ( Figure 3D) . ApoB, which participates in HCV virion release was included for comparison and was neither affected by the drug treatment. These results therefore suggested that RC did not inhibit HCV infection via influencing the host cells and is consistent with our data from the pre-treatment analysis (Figure 2 ).",

While the molecular constituents in RC contributing to its anti-HCV activity remain to be identified, the alkaloids are potential candidate bioactives which are known to be the major components of RC and are typically present in the alcoholic extracts of the herb [11] . Examples include berberine, coptisine, palmatine, epiberberine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, and groenlandicine, among other major compounds [11] . Whether a single compound or a combination of them contributes to RC's antiviral actions against HCV remains to be explored. Further in-depth analysis would be required to fully elucidate the bioactive ingredients responsible for RC's anti-HCV effect.",

The ability of RC to inhibit HCVpp infection suggests that its mechanistic target(s) may involve the HCV glycoproteins-mediated interactions with the host cell. A potential mechanism is the transient interaction(s) with the HCV glycoproteins that are inadequate to inactivate free viral particles but sufficiently effective to hinder contact with cell surface receptors/co-receptors. Additional mechanisms of action could also include concentration-dependent reversible conformational alterations in receptors/co-receptors or viral particles' structure to block viral entry. We also noted a moderate effect from RC in the post-infection stage (Figure 2) , albeit less pronounced compared to its impact in inhibiting HCV entry steps. This effect was not entirely due to inhibition of entry in subsequent de novo infection cycles, since treatment of subgenomic HCV replicon cells with RC also showed a moderate decrease in viral RNA in a preliminary experiment ( Figure S1 ). It is possible that RC may possess multiple mechanisms against HCV infection, which would necessitate further studies for clarification. Nonetheless, our results clearly demonstrated that RC most potently inhibited HCV entry. Therefore, we suggest that RC could be further explored for prophylactic/therapeutic management of hepatitis C.",
