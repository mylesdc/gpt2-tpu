            "text": "Globalization has been accompanied by the rapid spread of infectious diseases, and further strain on working conditions for health workers globally. Post-SARS, Canadian occupational health and infection control researchers got together to study how to better protect health workers, and found that training was indeed perceived as key to a positive safety culture. This led to developing information and communication technology (ICT) tools. The research conducted also showed the need for better workplace inspections, so a workplace audit tool was also developed to supplement worker questionnaires and the ICT. When invited to join Ecuadorean colleagues to promote occupational health and infection control, these tools were collectively adapted and improved, including face-to-face as well as on-line problem-based learning scenarios. The South African government then invited the team to work with local colleagues to improve occupational health and infection control, resulting in an improved web-based health information system to track incidents, exposures, and occupational injury and diseases. As the H1N1 pandemic struck, the online infection control course was adapted and translated into Spanish, as was a novel skill-building learning tool that permits health workers to practice selecting personal protective equipment. This tool was originally developed in collaboration with the countries from the Caribbean region and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Research from these experiences led to strengthened focus on building capacity of health and safety committees, and new modules are thus being created, informed by that work. The products developed have been widely heralded as innovative and interactive, leading to their inclusion into \"toolkits\" used internationally. The tools used in Canada were substantially improved from the collaborative adaptation process for South and Central America and South Africa. This international collaboration between occupational health and infection control researchers led to the improvement of the research framework and development of tools, guidelines and information systems. Furthermore, the research and knowledge-transfer experience highlighted the value of partnership amongst Northern and Southern researchers in terms of sharing resources, experiences and knowledge.",

These infections make up a substantial proportion of the infectious disease burden in high income as well as in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [9] . The risk of a HAI is 2-20 times higher in LMICs than in high income countries, and this may be an underestimate, due to differences in the intensity of surveillance [9, 10] . An estimated 20% of patients could suffer from preventable HAIs [11] . Along with patients, healthcare workers are also at high risk of exposure to biological agents in healthcare settings [12, 13] . Almost half the cases of SARS were in health workers [2] , 40% of the hepatitis B and C that occurs in health workers is estimated to be due to occupational exposures [11, 14, 15] , and health workers have a high risk of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis [16] .",

In a survey of 1,290 workers across sixteen hospitals in British Columbia the team found that health workers who rated the environmental protective measures highly at their institutions were 12 times more likely to report a high level of compliance with appropriate personal protective practices compared to those who did not rate this factor highly at their institutions. Similarly, those who perceived organizational factors in the workplace to be consistent with safe practices were 10 times more likely to report good compliance. Interestingly, though, there was no association with the individual factors previously thought to be pivotal in affecting compliance [17] . Next, a survey of infection control and occupational health resources and a questionnaire completed by healthcare workers were compared with on-site observational audits in facilities in British Columbia and Ontario. Health workers believed that plans were available to protect against future SARS-like events but audits revealed that these did not exist in many facilities. Both occupational health and infection control were underresourced post-SARS, with occupational health professionals particularly lacking in British Columbia. There was a discrepancy between health workers' perception of what was available and what is actually accessible in facilities [18] , highlighting the need for better communication.",

Under each hazard classification, the evaluator completes the workplace assessment form by indicating whether the environment and practices are satisfactory, require correction but are not an immediate hazard, or require immediate correction. Using the results of the questionnaire and needs assessment, local colleagues identified strengths and challenges at each healthcare facility and initiated projects to address the issues unearthed. For example, campaigns were begun to improve hand hygiene and reduce needlestick injuries, as well as implement muchneeded renovations in the emergency department of one of the hospitals [25] all priorities identified by using the tools developed.",

The audit tool is a structured form, which enables healthcare workers to evaluate their working environment in a systematic manner. Health and safety professionals have noted that the tool has enabled them to set priorities and act upon identified needs.

Ironically, perhaps, worker health and safety has not received greater attention in the healthcare sector than in other economic sectors [4] , despite the fact that health workers constitute the largest workforce in the world, with an estimated 59 million worldwide [31] . While the tools we produced are limited in conveying an indepth understanding of the complex global forces that weaken public health systems, hindering the allocation of resources to infection control and worker health, they do help mitigate the impact of resource strains in countries such as Ecuador and South Africa, where strong government commitment has been expressed towards health system improvement and worker well-being.",

First, there was the partnership between Canadian occupational health and infection control [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 32, 34] researchers, and simultaneously, a partnership between an inter-disciplinary Ecuadorean occupational and environmental health team and Canadian counterparts who shared an appreciation of an ecosystem approach to human health [38] , including its applicability to emerging infectious diseases [39] . Meanwhile, a new partnership was being forged between the combined Canadian occupational health and infection control team and their South African counterparts [26] , brought together by the World Health Organization (WHO). Finally, with the assistance of PAHO and later also the WHO, the various partnerships were brought together, informing each other in what became an integrated international approach to promoting healthy healthcare.",

Thus it was essential that we involved the local healthcare leadership, already established occupational health services as well as health and safety committee members and governmental-based expertise at the outset. In Ecuador, the project built on a strong partnership between the University of Andina Simon Bolivar, the University of Cuenca, and various other universities and healthcare facilities on one hand, and the various centres at the University of British Columbia on the other. Having a strong local champion is key to success, and Ecuadorean co-author (JB) fulfilled that role. Similarly, we chose Pelonomi Regional Hospital in the Free State as a research pilot site to support knowledge translation and capacity building, in large part due to the local champion.",

Learning from this, before launching the full pilot in South Africa, decision-makers (including coauthor LN) started planning for scale-up early, should the pilot prove successful. This required thinking through complexities beyond the pilot, such as who will continue to implement and monitor the model after the pilot has ended, and how should the model be altered in the pilot with such questions in mind. By working closely with the WHO, the International Labour Office, the International Commission on Occupational Health, and a world-expert on scaling up [42] , we are now optimistic that the tools produced will be successfully used not only in local pockets, but on national and international scale.",
