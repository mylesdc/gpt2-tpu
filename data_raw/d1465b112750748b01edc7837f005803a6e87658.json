YmdB, a member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of RNase III activity; however, the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined. YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition. Results: The expression of >2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated, of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly, YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB.",

            "text": "RNase III family members cleave double-stranded RNAs to yield 5\u2032 phosphate and 3\u2032 hydroxyl termini, and are extensively conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . During bacterial ribosome biogenesis, RNase III processes the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursors [8] , and also mediates the maturation and/or degradation of different types of transcripts [9] , small RNAs [10, 11] , and mRNAs containing rnc [12, 13] or pnp genes [14] . The structural and mechanistic features of RNase III have been extensively studied [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ; however, questions remain concerning the cellular control of RNase III activity under different physiological conditions. In E. coli, some proteins are known as regulators for endo-RNase activity [15] [16] [17] [18] . For example, RraA and RraB negatively regulate RNase E activity [15, 16] . In case of RNase III, bacteriophage T7 protein kinase [17] and YmdB [18] identified as an either activator or inhibitor of RNase III function. The activation process by bacteriophage T7 protein kinase is through binding to RNase III and phosphorylates the enzyme on serine [17] . YmdB was the first RNase III-binding inhibitor to be identified in vivo using a novel genetic screening approach and, in common with other RNase regulators, YmdB expression is modulated by cold-or growth-stress [18] . YmdB, acting in concert with other uncharacterized stress-mediated trans-acting factors, facilitates the regulation of RNase III activity under growth- [18] or osmotic stress conditions [19] . Several protein identities are proposed for the trans-acting inhibitor(s) and potential targets of their inhibition has been suggested; for example, cellular targets of RNase III activity, such as the RNase III gene itself, rnc [12, 13] , pnp [14] , and rRNA processing by YmdB [18] and the level of bdm mRNA encoding a protein that promotes biofilm formation by unknown trans-acting factor(s) [19] . The cellular processes required for RNase III inhibition by trans-acting factor(s) during stress responses are unclear; however, one post-transcriptional pathway has been proposed [7] , which involves the general stress-responsive regulator, RpoS [20] . By cleaving the rpoS mRNA 5\u2032-leader [21] , RNase III reduces RpoS production; the presence of YmdB limits this reaction and as a consequence, increases RpoS levels, which supports entry into the stationary phase [7] . This hypothesis behind this process came from a study that used an RNase III mutant [21] ; however, to clarify and identify new targets of RNase III inhibition, it is essential to adopt a model that mimics physiological RNase III inhibition via the induction of trans-acting factor(s).",

            "text": "The present study investigated RNase III inhibition via the ectopic expression of the regulatory protein, YmdB, and identified novel targets of inhibition. We also explored the mechanism(s) by which biofilm formation is regulated. Gene expression profiling of the entire E. coli open reading frame (ORF) following YmdB overexpression was performed using DNA microarray analysis, and revealed that~2,000 transcripts were modulated. Of these, 129 genes spanning ten cellular processes were strongly modulated by YmdB expression. About 40 of these were similarly controlled by RNase III, including five novel targets. Moreover, among the YmdB-modulated genes, ten are reported to be related to biofilm formation, the presence of which is a universal feature of bacteria and a component of multicellular communities [22] . Biochemical analyses indicate that induction of YmdB strongly inhibits biofilm formation in a manner similar to that of RpoS, which is a regulator of general stress responses [20] and a biofilm inhibitor [23] [24] [25] . Inhibition occurred via two mechanisms that were either dependent or independent of RNase III activity. Genetic studies revealed that the YmdB-and RpoS-induced decrease in biofilm formation required RpoS and YmdB, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified a novel role for YmdB as a modulator of biofilm formation, and revealed how a trans-acting factor can regulate RNase III activity, as well as function independently to enable a rapid response to changing cellular needs.",

In these experiments, total steady-state RNA extracted from IPTG-induced exponentially grown cells expressing either ASKA-ymdB (a part of the ASKA (\u2212) library: a complete set of cloned individual E. coli genes encoding proteins with 6x histidines at the N-terminal end and no GFP fusion at the C-terminal end [35] ); or pCA24N (a control vector without GFP at the C-terminal end) [29] were analyzed on customized ORF microarray chips. Duplicate arrays were performed with biological replicates to minimize experimental artifacts, and the gene expression profiles of 4,289 genes were averaged and analyzed. YmdB overexpression modulated the relative abundance of more than 2,000 transcripts (data not shown). Of these, 129 genes were strongly regulated (changes in expression of either >1.5 or <0.6 fold) (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). YmdB was previously identified as an RNase III regulator [18] ; thus, we examined the number of YmdBmodulated genes that were related to the down-regulation of RNase III activity to identify RNase III/YmdB-regulatory genes. The microarray data related to YmdB overexpression were compared with the tiling array data for an RNase III mutant [36] , in which 592 genes were affected by the absence of RNase III. Of 127 coding genes from the tiling array data, 47 are known RNase III targets and, of these, 37 were similarly regulated by YmdB and the RNase III mutant (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). This suggests that YmdB modulates these genes by downregulating RNase III activity. However, 80 genes that were not previously regarded as RNase III targets also appeared to be modulated via an as yet uncharacterized YmdB function(s). When the 80 genes were classified according to the biological process in which they are involved, we identified ten different cellular processes that were modulated by YmdB induction (Table 1) . Therefore, the data indicate that YmdB, either as an RNase III regulator or by itself, participates in the regulation of multiple cellular processes within E. coli.",

For all known RNase III-target genes, increased expression was observed in the RNase III mutant (rnc14), which correlated with the YmdB overexpression data (Table 2) . Moreover, gene expression decreased or remained at the same level in a ymdB knockout strain in which RNase III activity was upregulated, suggesting that YmdB-mediated inhibition of RNase III activity is not involved in the regulation of genes of previously known to be RNase III targets. The abundance of mRNAs for the unconfirmed RNase III target genes was measured in the RNase III mutant and then compared with the data regarding YmdB overexpression (Table 2) . From five genes, the expression of the pspB, pspC, and ahpC genes was slightly increased upon both YmdB overexpression and RNase III Genes 1 up-(>3-fold) or 2 down-(<0.5-fold) regulated by YmdB overexpression were indicated.

The physiological relevance of this inhibitory effect of YmdB is shown in Figure 1B . The total relative level of YmdB protein was assessed by Western Blotting [18] and was found to increase by 2.2-to 5.7fold in the presence of increasing concentrations of IPTG ( Figure 1B ) (increased YmdB expression in the absence of IPTG results from the leaky lac promoter in the ASKA plasmids) [35] .

Biofilm formation in the absence of RNase III (rnc14) increased by~52% (Figure 2A) , implying that inhibition of biofilm formation is independent of RNase III/YmdB heterocomplex, and that an alternative, hitherto uncharacterized, function of YmdB exists. To verify this possibility, we measured the inhibition of biofilm formation in the presence of YmdB overexpression (confirmed in Figure 2B ) against an rnc + and rnc14 background. The results showed that inhibition was almost the same between the wild-type strain (~70%) and the strain lacking RNase III (~67%) (Figure 2A ). By contrast, processing of pnp'-'lacZ mRNA, a known target for YmdB-mediated inhibition of RNase III activity [18] , is fully dependent on RNase III (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). Taken together, these results indicate that YmdB overexpression inhibits biofilm formation via an RNase III-independent pathway.",

This could indicate that YmdB is involved in, but not essential for, the inhibition of biofilm formation in E. coli, or that increased levels of YmdB affect biofilm formation by modulating associated cellular proteins and their pathways. To test this hypothesis, we sought to identify candidate genes whose mRNA levels were increased by YmdB (Table 1) and which have a known effect on the biofilm phenotype. One strong candidate is RpoS, a stress-responsive sigma factor [21] , which when overexpressed led to a reduction in biofilm formation (Figures 3B,C; [25] ). To determine whether YmdB-mediated inhibition of biofilm formation is dependent on the presence or absence of rpoS, we measured biofilm formation in an rpoS knockout strain (Keio-\u0394rpoS). Biofilm formation was activated in the rpoS knockout ( Figures 3A,C) . Subsequent introduction of a plasmid overexpressing YmdB only decreased biofilm inhibition by 12% in the rpoS knockout ( Figure 3B) whereas it resulted in 70% inhibition in wild-type cells ( Figure 2A) ; thus, the inhibition of biofilm formation by YmdB is RpoS-dependent.",

            "text": "Since YmdB is transcriptionally activated by RpoS [18] and the level of rpoS transcripts was increased by YmdB overexpression, it is possible that YmdB modulates RpoS expression. YmdB could affect this change in rpoS transcript levels (C) Expression of RpoS and YmdB. Protein expression was detected by immunoblotting using antibodies against RpoS and 6xHistidine tagged YmdB (His-YmdB) as described in Methods. S1 protein level was used as a loading control. All biofilm formation data were obtained as described in Methods. Data represent the mean values from ten independent experiments. by either acting as an as yet unknown transcription factor or by acting as an effector protein for the factor(s) involved in rpoS transcription. We found that YmdB overexpression had no effect on rpoS promoter activity (data not shown), thereby excluding any role as a transcription factor. A linear relationship between rpoS transcript levels and RpoS protein levels was then investigated following YmdB induction, and similar increases (~2.5-fold) in the induced \u03b2-galactosidase activity of the rpoS'-'lacZ protein fusion and the RpoS protein level were observed (Figures 4A,B) . Moreover, the steady-state level of rpoS transcript ( Figure 4C ) was oppositely regulated in the absence of chromosomal ymdB. Additionally, the level of rpoS transcript following YmdB overexpression was lower than that in the RNase III mutant strain. These data suggest that YmdB-mediated regulation of RNase III activity alone cannot fully regulate the processing of the 5\u2032 UTR of rpoS mRNA. Because RpoS can negatively regulate biofilm formation by itself ( Figure 3B ) and is also required for complete YmdB function ( Figure 3B ), it is a matter of debate whether YmdB can modulate RpoS activity. When the RpoS protein was overexpressed in a wild-type and in an ymdB knockout strain, RpoS-mediated inhibition of biofilm formation was decreased from 70% to 43% ( Figure 3B ). This, when taken together with the other data, suggests that the regulation of RpoS function during biofilm formation is dependent upon YmdB. Moreover, RpoS overexpression phenotype on biofilm inhibition was not dependent upon the presence of RNase III activity (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ). Thus, YmdB is a novel post-transcriptional regulator of RpoS levels that acts independently of RNase III.",

Previous results indicated that overexpression of RpoS was associated with decreased biofilm formation [25] . Our microarray, qPCR, and Western blotting data showed that overexpression of YmdB increased the levels of RpoS (Additional file 1: Tables S3, Figures 2, 3 and 4) .

Conversely, the possibility that YmdB is a transcription factor that activates rpoS transcription was initially suggested by observations that RpoS levels were increased by YmdB overexpression, and that YmdB and RpoS are both required for the decrease in biofilm formation. However, this theory was rejected because increases in YmdB expression had no effect on promoter activity (data not shown). Hence, YmdB-induced modulation of RpoS levels must occur via post-transcriptional regulation ( Figure 4) . It is also possible that YmdB modulates other rpoS transcription factor(s), although we have not identified which other transcription factors are required for this response. Overall, the data suggest that YmdB and RpoS are coregulators of biofilm formation ( Figure 5) .",

ClsC utilizes phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) as the phosphatidyl donor to phosphatidylglycine (PG) to form cardiolipin (CL) [46] . While YmdB is apparently not a direct modulator of that pathway (since changes in clsC (ymdC) gene expression in the microarrays were negligible (a 1.1-fold increase only); (data not shown), it may modulate it indirectly via the action of the fatty acid biosynthesis gene, fabD (Table 1) , on the CL synthesis-regulating gene; however, such a role has not been confirmed. The ectopic expression of YmdB almost completely regulates RNase III activity with respect to several targets, including pnp, rnc and ribosomal RNA processing (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ) [6] ; however, biofilm formation is not solely dependent upon YmdB-directed RNase III regulation, suggesting that gene expression data will be useful for identifying unknown RNase III-independently regulated YmdB functions.",

            "text": "Several trans-acting factors that modulate the RNase activity of both exo-and endo-RNases have been identified in E. coli [15] [16] [17] [18] 47, 48] . Among these four trans-acting regulatory proteins for endo-RNase activity have been well characterized in E. coli: RraA [15] and RraB [16] for RNase E, and bacteriophage T7 protein kinase [17] and YmdB [18] for RNase III. The presence of homologs in other species suggests such regulation of endo-RNase activity is generally required for bacterial physiology. Recently, gene expression profiling revealed a role for RraA in regulating the SOS response, a mechanism which responds to the stress caused by DNA damage [15, 49] . RNase III modulates approximately 12% (592 genes) of the E. coli genome [35] ; using YmdB-mediated down-regulation of RNase III rather than an RNase III mutant retains the ability to measure the effect of trans-acting factor(s) and hence the correct physiological modulation of RNase III. Because YmdB regulates the turnover of approximately 30% of the target genes of RNase III (Additional file 1: Table S3 ) and the rpoS level is not completely regulated by YmdB (Figure 4) , either other regulator(s) that result RNase III mutantlike conditions must be present or YmdB partially regulates the physiology of the RNase III-mutant to induce the up-regulation of an RNase III activator that has yet to be identified.",
