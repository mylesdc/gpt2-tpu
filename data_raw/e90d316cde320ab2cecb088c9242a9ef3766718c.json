            "text": "We performed a prospective study in patients with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia to investigate the diagnostic value of low-dose computed tomography compared to standard chest radiography. The aim was to compare both modalities for detection of pulmonary infections and to explore performance of low-dose computed tomography for early detection of invasive fungal disease. The low-dose computed tomography remained blinded during the study. A consensus diagnosis of the fever episode made by an expert panel was used as reference standard. We included 67 consecutive patients on the first day of febrile neutropenia. According to the consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had pulmonary infections. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 36%, 93%, 50% and 88% for radiography, and 73%, 91%, 62% and 94% for low-dose computed tomography, respectively. An uncorrected McNemar showed no statistical difference (p = 0.197). Mean radiation dose for low-dose computed tomography was 0.24 mSv. Four out of 5 included patients diagnosed with invasive fungal disease had radiographic abnormalities suspect for invasive fungal disease on the low-dose computed tomography scan made on day 1 of fever, compared to none of the chest radiographs. We conclude that chest radiography has little value in the initial assessment of febrile neutropenia on day 1 for detection of pulmonary abnormalities. Low-dose computed tomography improves detection of pulmonary infiltrates and seems capable of detecting invasive fungal disease at a very early stage with a low radiation dose.",

            "text": "Neutropenic fever is one of the most important complications in cancer patients. [1] It is critical to rapidly localize infections and identify the organism involved, especially for fungal infections, which need a specific treatment approach. Despite a standard diagnostic workup including chest radiograph (CXR) and microbiological screening, no focus is identified in up to 44% of patients. [2] This can partly be explained by the low sensitivity of radiographs for diagnosing pulmonary infections in neutropenic patients. [3] Acquiring CXRs in respiratory asymptomatic patients with febrile neutropenia is therefore controversial. The ESMO guidelines recommend performance of a CXR in every neutropenic patient with fever, whereas the IDSA guidelines suggest its use only in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms. [1, 4] In febrile neutropenia a substantial part (~10%) of infections is caused by invasive fungal disease (IFD). [5] IFD usually presents as a pulmonary infection, which is rarely visible on CXR and is therefore often missed in the early phase of neutropenic fever. Notably, a delayed start of appropriate treatment has a negative impact on clinical outcome. [6] In order to improve the early detection of pulmonary infiltrates in febrile neutropenia, other imaging tools have been investigated as an alternative to CXR. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) improved pulmonary focus detection: pulmonary abnormalities were found in 60% of the neutropenic patients with persistent fever (>48 hours) and a normal CXR. [7] Furthermore, direct initiation of effective antifungal treatment after the early detection of a halo sign on HRCT images, had a positive effect on treatment response and survival in case of IFD, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. [8] However, due to costs and high radiation doses of approximately 7 mSv average, HRCT scanning is usually not incorporated in the initial febrile neutropenia workup. [9] Another imaging modality that could be used for the evaluation of febrile neutropenia is low-dose CT scanning (LDCT). LDCT is performed with low mean radiation doses below 1.5 mSv and without the use of contrast. Two studies comparing LDCT to CXR in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia demonstrated an increased detection of pulmonary abnormalities. [10, 11] Therefore, we hypothesized that LDCT already acquired on day 1 of febrile neutropenia would improve detection of pulmonary infections. The primary aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of LDCT and 2-view CXR for early detection of pulmonary infiltrates. The secondary aim was to explore its performance for early IFD detection.",

Standard microbiological screening included evaluation of urine and blood cultures. [1, 4] A respiratory microbiological evaluation was performed in case of a suspected pulmonary infection (clinical symptoms of dyspnea or cough, sputum production, or an oxygen saturation level <93%). For the respiratory evaluation a throat swab was taken and tested for viral pathogens with PCR pack 1 (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, rhinovirus) and PCR pack 2 (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenzavirus type 1-4, bocavirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). In case of a possible atypical pneumonia the swab was additionally tested for atypical pathogens with PCR pack 3 (Legionella pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psitacci, Coxiella burnetti). If sputum was available this was tested for bacteria (gram stain, culture) and fungal pathogens (blancophore stain, culture). Other microbiological testing was only performed if judged appropriate by the attending physician. Furthermore, serum samples were taken twice weekly for galactomannan (GM) testing at the end of inclusion.",

[10] compared CXR with LDCT in neutropenic AML patients with already clinically suspected pneumonia, and found abnormal imaging results in 31 of 40 CXRs, whereas 38 out of 40 patients had abnormalities on LDCT. Instead of only focusing on pulmonary abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary infection, this study also included radiological signs of cardiac failure or fluid overload, which might explain the high number of patients with abnormalities in both CXR and LDCT. [10] In a prospective study Kim et al. [11] evaluated the use of LDCT in a selection of patients with persistent neutropenic fever (>48 hours) regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms. Of the 207 included patients 150 were diagnosed with pneumonia (72%). Differences between sensitivity of CXR and LDCT for correctly diagnosing infectious pneumonia were a little less pronounced than in our study: CXR 39% and LDCT 63%.",

Therefore it can be expected that every improvement in the diagnostic workup will eventually lead to improved patient care.",
