            "text": "Background: Since H7N9 influenza A virus (H7N9) was first reported in 2013, five waves of outbreaks have occurred, posing a huge threat to human health. In preparation for a potential H7N9 epidemic, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of anti-H7N9 drugs with an appropriate model. Methods: Well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium (HAE) cells were grown at the air-liquid interface, and the H7N9 cell tropism and cytopathic effect were detected by immunostaining and hematoxylineosin (HE) staining. The H7N9 replication kinetics and anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human \u03b12b (rhIFN-\u03b12b) and rhIFN-\u03bb1 were compared with different cell lines. The H7N9 viral load and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were quantified by real-time PCR assays. Results: H7N9 could infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells within the three-dimensional (3D) HAE cell culture, which reduced the number of cilia and damaged the airways. The H7N9 replication kinetics differed between traditional cells and 3D HAE cells. Interferon had antiviral activity against H7N9 and alleviated epithelial cell lesions; the antiviral activity of rhIFN-\u03b12b was slightly better than that of rhIFN-\u03bb1. In normal cells, rhIFN-\u03b12b induced a greater amount of ISG expression (MX1, OAS1, IFITM3, and ISG15) compared with rhIFN-\u03bb1, but in 3D HAE cells, this trend was reversed. Conclusions: Both rhIFN-\u03b12b and rhIFN-\u03bb1 had antiviral activity against H7N9, and this protection was related to the induction of ISGs. The 3D cell culture model is suitable for evaluating interferon antiviral activity because it can demonstrate realistic in vivo-like effects.",

Antiviral treatment is another critical strategy for controlling infection with H7N9, and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are the most widely used drugs against influenza infection [3] . However, with the increase in drug-resistance-conferring mutations, other measures are also needed to treat infection with H7N9. Previous studies have shown that type I interferon (IFN) was active against the influenza 2009 pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1 strains [4, 5] . Additionally, the natural IFN Alferon N, was shown to inhibit the replication of oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant H7N9 isolates [6] .",

The morphology and functionality of these cells resembles the in vivo human pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium, and this system is a promising tool for the study of respiratory viruses. Many common and emerging respiratory viruses, such as influenza A [7, 8] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [9] , adenovirus (ADV) [10] , parainfluenza virus (PIV) [11] , and human coronavirus (HCoV) [8, 12] , can replicate in these three-dimensional (3D) HAE cells. Moreover, some newly described viruses, including HBoV [13, 14] and HCoV HKU1 [15] , that could not be cultured on traditional cell lines can be cultured on these cells. Of the currently available cell culture models, 3D HAE cells reconstruct the morphological and physiological characteristics of the respiratory tract to the greatest extent, therefore, it is a robust cellular model for respiratory virus research and can also be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drugs and transgenic strategies [16] .",

In addition, there was a dose-effect relationship between the dose of rhIFN-\u03b12b or rhIFN-\u03bb1 and its activity against H7N9. In all three cell types, the antiviral activity of rhIFN-\u03b12b was slightly better than that of rhIFN-\u03bb1 to varying degrees. Together, these results highlight the inconsistencies between the replication kinetics of H7N9 in 2D-cultured cells and 3D HAE cells as well as the differences in the antiviral activity of rhIFNs between different cells.",

So, the tissue sources of the two cell lines are basically the same. The two chains of type I IFNs receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and a component of the type III IFN receptor, IL10R2, was expressed in all cells, while IFNLR1, another component of type III IFN receptors, was only expressed in certain cells. It was reported the expression of IFNLR1 in A549 cells and lung tissue were almost similar using northern blot analysis [26] , so the expression levels of type I and type III IFN receptors were also consistent. When binding to receptors located on the cell surface, IFN triggers the downstream JAK-STAT signaling pathway and eventually induces the expression of a series of ISGs. These genes target multiple stages of the viral life cycle and exhibit various antiviral activities due to their diverse structures and functions. MX1 [27, 28] and IFITM3 [29, 30] mainly effect viral invasion, while OAS1 [31] and ISG15 [32, 33] act primarily on the viral replication and transcription stages.",

In the A549 and 2D HAE cells, the expression levels of these four genes were significantly higher in the rhIFN-\u03bb1 group than in the rhIFN-\u03b12b group. However, it is noteworthy that the corresponding result was exactly the opposite in the 3D HAE cells.

After treatment of A549 cells, 2D HAE cells, and 3D HAE cells with rhIFN-\u03b12b or rhIFN-\u03bb1, the total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed. The relative expression levels of ISG15, MX1, OAS1, and IFITM3 were measured using Taqman real-time PCR assays and quantified by the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 Fig. 4 Cytopathic effect of rhIFN on 3D HAE cells. After being incubated for 24 h with rhIFN-\u03bb1 or rhIFN-\u03b12b, the 3D HAE cells were infected with 100 TCID 50 of H7N9 for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with HE, and images were taken with a microscope at a magnification of 40\u00d7 0.01 pg/ml did not increase the MX1 expression level [34] . In this study, we found that MX1 expression increased markedly following treatment with rhIFN-\u03bb1 or rhIFN-\u03b12b in 2D HAE and A549 cells compared with the results for 3D HAE cells. In addition, knockdown of MX1 expression resulted in a remarkable decrease in the expression of ISGs in A549 cells after infected with influenza A virus, thereby increased virus replication [28] . Although the upregulation of IFN-induced IFITM3 observed in this study was relatively low, the key role of this ISG cannot be ignored. Remarkably, IFITM3 can inhibit H7N9 replication early in viral infection [35] . Additionally, it was reported that monomethylation of IFITM3 at Lys-88 is downregulated after treatment rhIFN-\u03b1, thereby enhancing IFITM3 activity and inhibiting influenza virus [36] . Furthermore, the overexpression of IFITM proteins can rigidify the cell membrane, thus markedly inhibiting viral membrane fusion and entry [37] . IFITM3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the influenza disease, and it may serve as a potential target for treatment and management of influenza-associated infection.",
