            "text": "Background. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most prevalent human pathogens, and consist of 101 serotypes that are classified into groups A and B according to sequence variations. HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. Methods and Findings. To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5' noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples). Typing was completed for 101 samples and 103 HRVs were identified. Surprisingly, 54 (52.4%) HRVs did not match any of the known serotypes and had 12-35% nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference HRVs. Of these novel viruses, 9 strains (17 HRVs) segregated from HRVA, HRVB and human enterovirus into a distinct genetic group (''C''). None of these new strains could be cultured in traditional cell lines. Conclusions. By molecular analysis, over 50% of HRV detected in sick infants were previously unrecognized strains, including 9 strains that may represent a new HRV group. These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains is considerably larger than the 101 serotypes identified with traditional diagnostic techniques, and provide evidence of a new HRV group.",

The first HRV was discovered in 1956 [2, 3] , and by 1987, 101 serotypes (1A and 1B to 100) were identified using susceptible cell cultures and specific antisera [4, 5, 6] . Multiple epidemiologic studies of serotype circulation conducted between [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] showed that .90% of field isolates could be identified with the 90 serotype-specific antisera prepared before 1973, and many serotypes identified earlier were still circulating [6, 7, 8] . These results suggested HRV serotypes are stable and do not undergo influenza virus-like antigenic drift [7] .",

This traditional serological method is insensitive, labor intensive and cumbersome [24] . More sensitive and faster molecular methods have been developed for serotyping enteroviruses, which are closely related to HRV [25] . In addition, molecular typing methods have been used to identify the links between illnesses and specific strains of pathogens such as dengue viruses, influenza viruses, human papillomaviruses, hepatitis C viruses, and HIV [26, 27] . Molecular typing involves PCR amplification of a portion of the target viral genome, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. In this report, we analyzed clinical specimens from sick infants with a new molecular method, and identified 26 new HRV strains including 9 that constitute a new HRV group.",

The degenerate primers EV292 and EV222 for PCR amplification of NIm-1A region were not sensitive enough for direct detection of small amount of HRV in original clinical samples (data not shown), and high titer infected cell lysates of cultured isolates were needed to produce enough PCR product for cloning and sequencing. The length of NIm-1A and P1-P2 sequences ranged 329-356 bases and 263-271 bases, respectively. Based on phylogenetic tree reconstruction of NIm-1A sequences, the 79 clinical isolates were assigned to 24 different serotypes with highly significant bootstrap values (77-100%, Table 1 ). Identical assignment results were obtained with P1-P2 tree, although a number of assignments (HRV1B, HRV15, HRV85 and one of the 5 HRV89) had low but still significant bootstrap values (60%, 64%, 61% and 62%, respectively). Interestingly, the nucleotide divergence between the clinical isolates and the respective reference strain was lower at the P1-P2 region (mean 3.5%, range 0-8%) than at the NIm-1A region (mean 9.6%, range 5-13%) ( Table 1) . This result agreed with previous reports that nucleotide sequences were more conserved at the NCRs than the coding region due to the preservation of conserved RNA structure elements within the NCR [31, 32] .",

Three sequences clustered with HRV89 but had poor bootstrap values (,50%) although they had 99% identity with HRV89 reference sequences. This was probably because these 3 HRVs also matched well with HRV36, which has 97% identity with HRV89 in the P1-P2 region. These 46 HRVs and P3) and variable region between P1 and P2 (P1-P2 in red) at the 5'NCR and the PCR fragments used in this study. P1, P2 and P3 are located at bases 163-181, 443-463 and 535-551, respectively in HRV16 genome. PCR fragment A (about 900bps) was used to determine the 5'NCR sequences of all 101 HRV serotypes. It was amplified using pan-HRV PCR forward primer P1-1, which anneals to conserved region P1, and a serotype-specific reverse primer annealed to the 5' end of VP2 gene (between base# 1000 and 1100). PCR fragment B (about 390 bps) was generated with pan-HRV PCR forward primer P1-1 and reverse primer P3-1. PCR fragment C (about 300 bps) was generated with forward primer P1-1 and an equimolar mixture of reverse primers P2-1, P2-2 and P2-3. The variable sequences of P1-P2 were used for the molecular typing assay. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000966.g001 were grouped into 23 HRV serotypes; 42 (19 serotypes) were HRVA and 4 (4 serotypes) were HRVB viruses ( Table 3) .",

This new assay had 3 key components: sensitive pan-HRV primers and semi-nested PCR to amplify P1-P2 region from cDNA prepared from original clinical specimens, a sequence database of 260-bp P1-P2 region of 5'NCR of all 101 HRV serotypes to serve as standard references for HRV identification, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction of the new P1-P2 sequences and the 101 homologous reference sequences. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction has been shown to be more accurate than the other sequence analysis methods for molecular typing of enteroviruses [34] . Interestingly, the 5'NCR is not suitable for typing of enterovirus. For example, the 5'NCR sequence of coxackieviruses do not correlate with serotype and VP1 sequence due to frequent recombination at the 5'NCR [35, 36] . In contrast, HRV maintains consistent phylogeny across its genome and has limited recombination [31] , and this characteristic enables 5'NCR sequence (P1-P2) to be used for strain identification. For enteroviruses, VP1 sequencing is commonly used for molecular serotyping because this region contains major antigenic sites that correlate well with serotype [25] . However, VP1 sequences of HRV are less conserved, and degenerate primer pairs such as EV292 and EV222 [24] that target this region were relatively insensitive for PCR amplification.",

The P1-P2 phylogenetic tree (not shown) revealed that HRV-QPM and one of our new HRVA viruses, W24, were the same strain and thus supported McErlean's conclusion that HRV-QPM was a group A virus. The VP4 tree (not shown) confirmed McErlean's finding that HRV-QPM and the 8 NY HRVs belonged to the same cluster within HRVA group. Therefore the 8 NY HRVs and HRV-QPM were related to our 17 new HRVA strains. In contrast, our 9 HRVC strains form a distinct group separated from both HRVA and HRVB (Figure 4) .",

Moreover, 97.5% of all the P1-P2 pairs from distinct serotypes had .9% pairwise nucleotide divergence. Despite this inter-serotype variability, the P1-P2 sequence of 5'NCR was significantly more conserved between clinical isolates and the corresponding reference prototype strain (mean divergence 3.5%) compared to the NIm-1A coding sequences of VP1 (mean divergence 9.6%, Table 1 ).

These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains has been markedly underestimated by traditional viral culture and serotyping techniques, and also raise additional questions. First, how widespread are these This tree was generated as described in Figure 3 . None of the new strains clustered with HRVB viruses. Seventeen new strains (blue) belonged to HRVA group, and 9 strains (red) cluster into a new group (''C'') that is separate from groups A and B. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000966.g004 putative ''group C'' HRV? Our study population consisted of a group of infants who experienced frequent illnesses, and additional studies are needed to define the spectrum of HRV infections in unselected populations, and in subjects of other age groups. Secondly, is the biology of these novel strains similar to that of other HRV? The inability to culture these viruses suggests that receptor utilization or other growth requirements are distinct. The development of molecular assays for the detection and analysis of respiratory viruses provide important tools for new epidemiologic and mechanistic studies to address these questions. A more complete understanding of the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their biology is essential for efforts directed at prevention and treatment of these common and clinically significant illnesses.",

Detailed viral RNA preparation, RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing procedure have been described elsewhere [33] . Briefly, total nucleic acids were prepared from 100 ml of infected cell lysate by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RT (reverse transcription)-PCR was performed in a RT-PCR mix (Invitrogen 11922-028) using the following conditions: 30 min at 50uC, 2 min at 94uC, 33 cycles of (30 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at 50uC, 60 sec at 68uC) and 5 min at 68uC. The PCR primer pairs were forward primer P1-1 (CAAGCACTTCTGTYWCCCC) for all serotypes and a serotype-specific reverse primer. Primer P1-1 was designed within the conserved P1 region (Figure 1 ). The reverse primer was selected for each of the 101 serotypes within a region corresponding to bases 1000-1100 of HRV16 near the 5' end of VP2 gene ( Figure 1 ) according to published sequences [29] . The PCR product, a DNA fragment of about 900 bp covering 75% of the 5'NCR, complete VP4 gene and about 200 bases of VP2 gene (PCR fragment A of Figure 1 ), was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After the agarose was removed by phenol extraction, PCR fragments were treated with kinase, ligated to a StuI-linearized plamsid vector pMJ3, and then transformed into E. coli. Three plasmids with PCR fragment inserted were isolated for each serotype, amplified and purified. Each viral DNA fragment was completely sequenced (Automated DNA Sequencing Facility, U. Wisconsin). The serotype identity of each sequence was verified by matching of its VP4/VP2 sequence to the respective published sequence [29] .",

For reverse primers, multiple candidates were designed within highly conserved P2 and P3 regions (Figure 1 ). Primers P3-1 (ACGG-ACACCCAAAGTAG), P2-1 (TTAGCCACATTCAGGGGC), P2-2 (TTAGCCACATTCAGGAGCC) and P2-3 (TTAGCC-GCATTCAGGGG) were selected based on efficient HRV sequence amplification. For the first PCR, 2.5 ml of leftover cDNA from the RMA assay was added to a tube containing 23 ml Platinum PCR SuperMix HF (Invitrogen 12532-016), 1 ml of forward primer P1-1 (25 mM) and 1 ml of reverse primer P3-1 (25 mM). The reaction started with 2 min at 94uC, followed by a 'touchdown' cycle (The steps were 94uC for 20 s, 68uC down to 52uC (2uC intervals) for 30 s, and then 68uC for 40 s. There were two cycles for each annealing temperature down to 54uC followed by 12 cycles at 52uC, and then a final 5 min at 68uC. This reaction produces a PCR product of 390 bp (Figure 1, fragment B) . For the second PCR, 5 ml of the first PCR product was transferred to a new PCR tube containing 50 ml Platinum PCR SuperMix HF, 1 ml of forward primer P1-1 (25 mM) and 1 ml of each reverse primer P2-1 (25 mM), P2-2 (25 mM) and P2-3 (25 mM). The reaction conditions are 2 min at 94uC, 28 cycles of (20 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at 52uC, 40 sec at 68uC) and 3 min at 68uC. The final product is a 300 bp DNA fragment ( Figure 1, fragment C) . This semi-nested PCR protocol requires only 10 copies of cDNA template per sample to produce sufficient product for cloning and does not produce nonspecific product from original clinical specimens (data not shown). Fragment C was then purified, cloned, and 3 plasmids containing fragment C were isolated and sequenced for each sample. For 2 samples, 2 different P1-P2 sequences were found, indicating the presence of more than one serotype/strain, so 6 additional plasmids were analyzed.",

NIm-1A is a dominant antigenic site of HRV first identified for HRV14 [1] , and the homologous sequences of this region correlate well with serotype of HRVs and enteroviruses [57, 58] . Viral RNA was isolated from virus-infected culture supernatant of 79 HRV clinical isolates with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen 52904) as described [24] .

The scale bar (top left) represents the genetic distance (nucleotide substitutions per site).
