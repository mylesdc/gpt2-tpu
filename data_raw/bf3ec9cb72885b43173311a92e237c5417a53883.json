            "text": "The tracing of potentially infectious contacts has become an important part of the control strategy for many infectious diseases, from early cases of novel infections to endemic sexually transmitted infections. Here, we make use of mathematical models to consider the case of partner notification for sexually transmitted infection, however these models are sufficiently simple to allow more general conclusions to be drawn. We show that, when contact network structure is considered in addition to contact tracing, standard ''mass action'' models are generally inadequate. To consider the impact of mutual contacts (specifically clustering) we develop an improvement to existing pairwise network models, which we use to demonstrate that ceteris paribus, clustering improves the efficacy of contact tracing for a large region of parameter space. This result is sometimes reversed, however, for the case of highly effective contact tracing. We also develop stochastic simulations for comparison, using simple re-wiring methods that allow the generation of appropriate comparator networks. In this way we contribute to the general theory of network-based interventions against infectious disease.",

The impact of this kind of contact tracing is a priori likely to depend strongly on the network of contacts linking people together. In this paper, we develop new mathematical and computational techniques to model the impact of clustering: the probability that any two contacts of a given individual are also linked to each other in the network, creating triangles.

The second problem with the standard closure is the question of how triangles of three infected individuals behave during the early asymptotic stage of an epidemic, where all dynamical variables are governed by the proportion of the population that is infectious, (\u00bdI=N)%1. While for pure SIS dynamics these triples are not dynamically important, when we come to consider contact tracing similar terms will become relevant. Under (4) and assuming the prevalence of infection is very low, the proportion of unclosed triples composed of three infected individuals is proportional to \u00bdI=N as expected. However, under (4), the proportion of triangles where all three individuals are infected is not small (and does not scale with \u00bdI=N); clearly, this is inconsistent and should be rectified in any improved closure. Motivated by these two considerations, we propose an alternative that respects (6) and has appropriate polynomial dependence on \u00bdI=N during the early epidemic.",

This gives the results in Figure 4 , which show that clustering increases the efficacy of contact tracing at a given success rate at one infectious generation, but not at 0.1 generations, depending on the actual tracing success rate.

This means that clustering can be expected to enhance the efficacy of contact tracing by increasing the neighbourhood size of the infected sub-network. On the other hand, to explain a constant level of endemic infection as clustering is increased, a larger underlying rate of transmission must be present, which will undermine tracing as an individual left untouched by a wave of tracing will reinfect their immediate neighbourhood more quickly. Exactly which parameter choices allow either effect to dominate is not clear, except that lower levels of tracing success always cause clustering to increase the efficacy of tracing.

We see a final reversal of the impact of clustering in Pane B, which is present in only the pairwise system: at longer times clustering again reduces the efficacy of contact tracing. At this point, stochastic variability in simulations has become highly significant and so we would not expect the two models to agree, since the pairwise equations should only hold in the limit where stochastic effects are negligible. To simulate in this regime would require extremely large population sizes, perhaps beyond what would ever be considered for realistic human scenarios.",
