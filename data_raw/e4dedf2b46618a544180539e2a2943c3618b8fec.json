            "text": "In recent years, various types of biosensors have been increasingly becoming practical and useful tools in a wide variety of analytical devices [1, 2] . The immobilization of biological elements to realize the biosensor is an essential step for the successful construction of a diagnostic system. In order to allow the detection of a small amount of target sample and improve detection performance, bioreceptor proteins must be immobilized onto biosensor chip surfaces with high density and nonspecific adsorption avoided or at least minimized. Moreover, orientation control with retention of protein conformation and activity is a required task to be established [3] . One method involves the physical adsorption via van der Waals forces, ionic binding or hydrophobic and polar forces on an insoluble matrix. This is a simple process which causes little disruption of the proteins, while it is unstable during the binding procedure due to the highly dependency against environmental conditions in maintaining its functional characteristics. Thus, the resulting receptor layer seems to form heterogeneous and random orientation. Another method can also be constructed by crosslinking functional reagents by a certain number of functional groups due to its simple procedure and strong chemical bond of proteins. This is widely used for stabilization of proteins that are covalently bound onto the support platform generated by chemical treatment. However, this method has also disadvantages as follows: the difficulty in controlling the crosslinking reaction, the gelatinous nature of the proteins and the relatively low activity of the proteins due to the specific structural features [3, 4] . In each of these methods used for the favorable performance of biosensors, a number of factors deserve careful consideration for strong binding forces between the solid surface and recognition elements, exposure of active sites on the target sample, conservation of biological activity after immobilization process, and simple protocol [3, 4] .",

Among them, gold-binding polypeptide (GBP) is one of the genetically engineered proteins for a strong binding onto the gold surface [7, 13, 14] . Whereas many proteins and chemicals bind to the gold surface with thiol linkage, GBP does not contain a cysteine residue having thiol group. Although the definite mechanism is not clear yet, it is estimated that these polar groups in GBPs seem to coordinately interact with the gold surface within a monolayer [15, 16] . In addition, the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomimetic interactions between the GBP, and the gold surface were investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [14, 17, 18] . Compared with other thiol-based systems, the GBP binds tightly to the gold surface due to the lower standard Gibbs free energy for the bond, and the binding process is fast under aqueous conditions compatible with biological environments [14, 17, 19] . These characteristics suggest its potential applications in nano-and bio-technologies as novel agents for surface functionalization [13] .",

We employed GBP-fusion proteins in the construction of biosensor for the detection of hepatitis B viral surface antigen (HBsAg) as a model (Figure 1 ), which is a biomarker for diagnosing the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The strong affinity between the GBP and the gold surface guarantees the stability of this sensor system and orients the sensing parts outward from the solid surface, exposing them directly to the target sample [13, 16] . Furthermore, electrochemical detection has attracted considerable interest recently for miniaturized analytical systems [20, 21] , including remarkable sensitivity (approaching that of fluorescence), inherent miniaturization of both the detector and control instrumentation, independence of optical path length or sample turbidity, low cost, low-power requirements and high compatibility [22, 23] . Besides, one of the most attractive points of this method is its potential for portable assays in a variety of point-of-care testing (POCT) environments. We here developed a simple platform biosensor technology by mediating the recognition parts and the solid surface on the gold substrate. SPR analyses were used for optimization of sample concentrations and verification of target sensing. Electrical signal-based detection methods for HBV such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were developed on the gold electrode surface, which has been a very versatile material in the field of biosensors.

The dynamic and specific binding of fusion proteins onto the gold sensor chip could be directly monitored in real time by Biacore \u00ae SPR spectroscopy ( Figure S3 in Supplementary material). A sharp increase in the SPR signal was observed upon introducing the 6HGBP-ScFv fusion protein solution onto the chip surface. About 93% of the injected total 6HGBP-ScFv fusion proteins were bound onto the gold sensor chip surface. Most 6HGBP-ScFv proteins remained bound to the gold surface after washing with PBS solution.

About 23% of ScFv protein was nonspecifically bound to the gold surface compared with 6HGBP-ScFv fusion protein.

The fusion protein 6HGBP-ScFv was immobilized onto the gold surface via its intrinsic affinity with the gold as shown in Figure 2 . Interestingly, coverage of 6HGBP-ScFv on the gold surface didn't always increase with increasing protein concentrations, a maximal RU change appearing at concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL. From this result, 6HGBP-ScFv concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL was chosen for subsequent experiments. Next, we checked the specificity of this platform with BSA as a negative control. First, 50 \u00b5g/mL of 6HGBP-ScFv was injected into the fluid phase, followed by 0.5 mg/mL BSA blocking of the binding sites on the fusion protein. Then, 10 \u00b5g/mL of control peptide (HOOC-CGPTGPTGPTGPTGPT-NH 2 ) as a negative control, 50, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 \u00b5g/mL of target HBsAg were injected into respective channels, respectively. Below concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL for HBsAg, RU levels dropped rapidly while target concentrations as low as 2.5 \u00b5g/mL can be detected compared with the control sample. For 50, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 \u00b5g/mL of target HBsAg, and 0.5 mg/mL of BSA, RU increase is 542.2 RU, 55.7 RU, 48.5 RU, 17.4 RU, 4.9 RU and 5.6 RU, respectively, showing an increasing trend of SPR signals with increasing concentration of target within this scope.",

Such miniaturization allows packing of numerous microscopic electrode transducers onto a small footprint of the biosensor device, and hence the design of high-density arrays was required. In this paper, EIS and CV were performed in order to characterize the electrode fabrication process, and EIS was applied to detect HBsAg. For the determination of optimal 6HGBP-ScFv coverage, its concentration and volume were carefully calculated in regard to that used in SPR analysis.",

            "text": "For the characterization of the electrode fabrication process, EIS and CV were performed each time after binding of each reagent. As shown in Figure 3(a) , the dotted line is the impedance spectrum obtained on the bare gold electrode. Frame circle line is an impedance spectrum of 50 \u00b5g/mL 6HGBP-ScFv fusion protein modified electrode, and solid circle line is that of after BSA blocking. Finally, solid line represents an impedance spectrum obtained after HBsAg binding. The result reveals the resistance of the electron transfer at the electrode surface increasing step by step because of the insulating effect of the binding proteins. This electron transfer resistance at the interface on the electrode surface, and solution can be determined by the diameter of the semi-circle of the curves in EIS spectra. After the gold electrodes were immobilized with GBP-ScFv, the peak current decreased dramatically with an increase of the peak-to-peak potential separation (\u0394Ep) for the bare gold electrode. When HBsAg was bound on the gold chip surface, the peak current more decreased and \u0394Ep (approximately 110 mV) increased comparing with those of the gold electrode and the GBP-ScFv immobilized chip, resulting from the electron transfer resistance of bound HBsAg molecules. BSA was used as a negative control. It can also be observed that the current responses in CV spectra (Figure 3 (b)) are decreasing in the process of electrode fabrication, which coincides with a conclusion drawn from impedance assay. These results were due to the insulating characteristics of the protein. As shown in Figure 4 , 50 \u00b5g/mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL, 100 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL of HBsAg were detected by using this method, respectively, and they presented a rough trend of increasing electron transfer resistance with increasing target concentrations. As a negative control, BSA of 10 \u00b5g/mL was detected at the same time. Numerical data were drawn by fitting with a circuit model as shown in an inset of Figure 4 . Correspondingly, binding of 50 \u00b5g/mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL, 100 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL of HBsAg and 10 \u00b5g/mL BSA caused electron transfer resistance increase of 8,493 \u2126, 6,473 \u2126, 4,047 \u2126, 3,097 \u2126, 2,143 \u2126, 1,513 \u2126 and 777 \u2126, respectively. Though linearity is not very strict as a function of HBsAg concentration, it demonstrated a rough linear trend into log scale. Target concentrations as low as 0.14 ng/mL of HBsAg calculated via 3-sigma rule was successfully detected compared with the negative control of 10 \u00b5g/mL of BSA ( Figure 4 ). Furthermore, a lower limit of detection (LOD) can be further expected if experimental conditions, such as 6HGBP-ScFv concentration, binding time, temperature and washing condition, were optimized. In order to check the nonspecific binding of real blood sample, we tested a fetal bovine serum of 10 \u00b5g/mL instead of HBsAg for clinical trials [27, 28] and confirmed no effect. Several procedures for HBV diagnosis with GBP-fusion protein were developed in this study. First, 6HGBP-ScFv fusion protein was prepared from simple cultivation of recombinant E. coli for HBsAg detection. This GBP-fusion protein allowed for the direct and easy immobilization onto the gold surface. Successful binding of the proteins was demonstrated by SPR optical analysis due to versatile use of gold in the sensing area. Second, this one-step immobilization process onto the solid surface is very simple. Strong affinity between the GBP and the gold surface guarantees the stability preventing possible leakage of sensing proteins. Binding of GBP onto the gold surface also might help to expose sensing molecules outward to react with their targets by arrangement for correct orientation of bioreceptor. Additionally, GBP prevents direct contact between proteins and the gold surface, which is advantageous for protein activity conservation. Furthermore, it is easy to conclude that a device capable of detecting multiple targets can be designed since the bio-recognition elements against targets can be easily fused with GBP via recombinant DNA technology or linker chemistry. Coupling with microfluidics, it can serve to minimize sample volume required as well as to decrease diagnosis time.",
