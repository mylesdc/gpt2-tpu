            "text": "Human papilloma virus-like particles (HPV VLP) serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for HPV. We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsVencapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation.",

            "text": "Despite decades of vaccine development, infectious diseases continue to be the major cause of mortality in much of the world. The roadblocks to global vaccination programs, including those in remote regions, are prohibitive costs of goods and delivery, use of needles, waste disposal, cold-chain requirements, and the crowded vaccination schedule. Solutions to many of these problems involve developing efficient vaccines that are stable at ambient temperatures that can be applied needle-free with minimal waste, and that combine vaccine antigens to reduce the number of inoculations. Here we present a case for a skin-targeted, freeze-dried formulation, combination human papillomavirus (HPV) pseudovirus (PsV) vaccine composed of the L1 and L2 capsid proteins of HPV16 and plasmids expressing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens.",

            "text": "Delivery to the skin using microneedles poses an attractive means of immunization. The skin is a potent site of immune induction due to the resident Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells poised to initiate immune responses to protect the host [1] . Because skin is so rich in antigen presenting cells (APCs), it is an inductive site that may require relatively low antigen doses and a lower requirement for adjuvants. Microneedle patches are an attractive mechanism for delivering biologics to skin, because they can be simply and painlessly applied to the skin for vaccination and other drug delivery purposes. Microneedles are capable of effectively delivering proteins, viruses and nucleic acids in low doses and can be engineered to be stable, strong, dissolvable and highly reproducible [2] . Naked DNA [3] [4] [5] [6] and both, influenza [7, 8] and HPV [9] virus-like particles (VLP), have been demonstrated to elicit both B and T-cell immune responses after administration to the skin using microneedles. Additionally, using dissolvable microneedles, replication-defective adenoviral vectors [10] and live measles virus vaccine [11] have been successfully administered and induced both CD8 + T cell and antibody responses.",

This, in combination with recent work suggesting that the L1 capsid protein-based HPV VLP vaccine, Gardasil, delivered to the skin with microneedles can elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAb) [9] , indicates that HPV PsV may be amenable to this delivery method while retaining their functionality. Here we show HPV PsV delivered to the skin using microneedles can induce immune responses to both the HPV capsid and to the antigens delivered by the encapsidated transgenes in the absence of adjuvant. Use of HPV as a delivery vehicle for plasmids encoding vaccine antigens using microneedles may therefore provide a safe and effective platform for the development of combination vaccines that are easily delivered and may have a much lower requirement for maintenance of a cold chain than currently available HPV vaccines.",

After two weeks of room temperature storage followed by rehydration in PBS, the lyophilized luciferase-expressing PsV proved equally effective at gene delivery when compared to previously frozen particles using the in vivo vaginal challenge model (Fig. 3A) and HPV16-GFP (green fluorescent protein) particles rinsed from microneedles were capable of delivering a plasmid in vitro as indicated by transduction of GFP expression into the cell (Fig. 3B) .

A luminescent signal could be detected over background in all PsV conditions tested and the transient kinetics of luciferase expression using this method is similar to what has been previously observed in the vaginal challenge model [26, 33, 34] . In animals inoculated with 10 microneedles, the signal peaked two days post-administration at levels that were much higher than background (Fig. 3C) .

These data signify that even a single administration of HPV16 PsV-coated microneedles was capable of eliciting sterilizing immunity against HPV. mmunogenicity is retained by inclusion of L2 and DNA using the HPV PsV. Animals received one of three variations of the HPV16 particle: L1 only, L1/L2 empty particles or L1/L2 encapsidating the RSV F protein expression plasmid (HPV16-F PsV).

The control arm received 10 microneedles coated with coating buffer only. Animals were immunized three times, each three weeks apart.

RSV M/M2 has been used as a model antigen for evaluating both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell-induced immunity in mice [32, 35] . Microneedles were coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-Luc and groups consisted of 10, 3 or 1 microneedle arrays for HPV16-M/M2 or 3 microneedle arrays for HPV16-Luc. Anti-HPV16 L1 antibodies could be detected by day 25, indicating that indeed the particles were successfully administered (data not shown). As reported for DNA vaccination, antigen-specific T cells are often undetectable after priming. Therefore boosting or viral challenge is required to assess the quality of priming for T cell responses [36] [37] [38] . One month after microneedle immunization, animals were divided into two groups: one was challenged with RSV and the other was boosted with a low-dose (10 7 pfu) of recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 vector (rAd5-M/M2) IM. Epitope-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells were measured in lungs 5 days post-RSV challenge. Only the groups immunized with 10 microneedle arrays demonstrated higher increases in CD8 + Tcell and significant increases in CD4 + T-cell responses (p = 0.04) above baseline after challenge ( Fig. 5A and 5B ). CD8 + tetramer responses were measured in blood fourteen days after boosting with rAd5-M/M2 and significantly higher responses (p = 0.04) compared to HPV-Luc immunized controls were only observed in animals immunized with 10 microneedle arrays (Fig. 5C ).",

The PsV were resistant to freeze drying, lyophilization and coating onto microneedle arrays, retaining both the conformation-dependent epitopes required for inducing neutralizing antibodies and the ability to transduce the genes of other antigens. These findings support the feasibility for using microneedle-based vaccination with HPV VLPs or PsV. Use of microneedles could eliminate the need for typical needle injections and provide a simpler, less painful, safer and potentially more cost-effective approach to vaccination by eliminating the need for cold-chain transportation and storage. response was observed.

Application of the vaccine within the dermal and epidermal layers may be effective at low dose due, in part, to the enrichment of sentinel antigen presenting cells (APCs) that constantly survey the tissue for foreign antigens [1, 39] . Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells are potent APCs that are directly targeted by the use of microneedle delivery to the skin. These cells represent a continually replenished population of immune stimulators which, once activated, travel to draining lymph nodes to present antigen to T cells. It is not known how the HPV particles were taken up and processed in this study. However, HPV may be especially effective and suited for microneedle delivery as this localizes the viral particles within the epithelium, a context for which they display a natural tropism for basal cells. The stability data and immunogenicity data presented here using PsV combined with the data from Corbett et al [9] suggest that HPV vaccine administration by microneedle arrays should be considered for clinical evaluation.",

Currently, much of these efforts are focused on IM delivery, and can directly induce or prime for significant T-cell and antibody responses. We have previously demonstrated that, when delivered to the genital mucosa, equivalent immune responses could be elicited with naked DNA compared to a 10,000-fold lower dose of the same DNA encapsidated within HPV PsV [24] .

With targeted microneedle delivery to basal epithelium based on HPV tropism, the current approach has potential to facilitate DNA delivery of genes expressing other vaccine antigens. In this study, we showed that microneedle delivery of HPV PsV to the skin can elicit both antibody and T cell responses against RSV antigens encoded by plasmid DNA encapsidated within the PsV. While the responses were relatively modest, a dose response was observed, and, in animals receiving the highest dosage, an immune response was generated that was capable of reducing viral replication. Co-administering an HPV PsV expressing an immune modifier could potentially enhance the B-and T-cell responses. Expression of the modifier would be transient thus diminishing safety concerns associated with the adverse effects of long-term expression or overexpression of immune modifiers.",

First, we found that lyophilized HPV VLP or HPV PsV could be applied to microneedles and remain antigenically stable at room temperature. Second, vaccination with HPV VLP generated a robust and protective immune response, supporting the development of microneedle delivery for HPV vaccination in place of IM injection. Third, vaccination with HPV PsV generated strong, protective immune responses against HPV and induced dose-dependent B-and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated DNA. These data support the future development of combination vaccination strategies in which the HPV PsV vector generates immunity against both HPV and the antigen expressed from the encapsidated plasmid DNA. We conclude that vaccination with microneedles may be an ideal method for HPV vaccination as a VLP, and may allow future development of HPV PsV-encapsidated DNA vaccine concepts that would result in immunity to HPV and additional antigens encoded by the DNA.
