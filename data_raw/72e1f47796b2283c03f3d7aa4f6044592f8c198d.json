Due to the difficulty in isolating and growing this virus in cell culture, few vaccine studies using cell culture propagated PEDV have been performed on U.S. strains in pigs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response to the selected inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate in a dose-titration manner. Results: PEDV was isolated from a pig with diarrhea and complete genome sequencing found >99% nucleotide identity to other U.S. PEDV. Inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccines were administered intramuscularly to five week old pigs in a dose titration experimental design, ranging from 6.0-8.0 log 10 tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 /mL), to evaluate immunogenicity using a fluorescent foci neutralization assay (FFN), fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on sera. Pigs vaccinated with 8.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL inactivated virus showed significantly higher FFN titers as well as FMIA and ELISA values than 6.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL vaccinates and the negative controls.",

The strain 83P-5, attenuated by one-hundred cell culture passages, is a subgroup I isolate that has been licensed in Japan as an attenuated live PEDV vaccine [13] . During the attenuation process, this strain acquired fourteen amino acid changes in the immunodominant spike (S) protein, which is critical for virus binding to cell receptors and is the target of neutralizing antibodies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The live attenuated DR13 vaccine strain of PEDV, whose parent strain was a subgroup II had thirteen of these fourteen mutations as well, and subsequently clustered with subgroup I [13] . Serial passage of 83P-5 in Vero cells resulted in attenuation of virulence in vivo and the strong selection for the viral spike (S) gene was associated with these phenotypic changes.",

While attenuated in their ability to cause disease, the safety of using MLV has been questioned, as MLV are shed in the environment. Virus was detected in feces of 3-day old piglets up to seven days after oral inoculation with DR13 passage 100 [12, 21] .

In late 2010, China experienced a severe outbreak of PEDV in suckling pigs, causing drastic economic losses [24] . This outbreak was caused by a strain with a phylogenetically distinct S gene from other Chinese strains and from vaccine strain CV777 [24] . In 2012, the PEDV infection rates in vaccinated herds in China increased dramatically. Phylogenetic analysis of new variants from the outbreak showed insertions and deletions in antigenic regions of the S gene that may have influenced the efficacy of the CV777 MLV [25] . Investigation into whether an inactivated vaccine can elicit a protective immune response could lead to the development of vaccines more closely related to field strains and avoid potential antigenic changes due to excessive in vitro cultivation.",

With mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets and total losses estimated over 5 million animals in the U.S. in less than one year, PEDV vaccines are critically needed (www.aasv.org). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allows for the production of autogenous vaccines to address emerging diseases; however the difficulty in isolating PEDV in cell culture increases the difficulty in producing efficacious inactivated vaccines. Here, PEDV was isolated from pooled intestinal homogenate and passaged in cell culture. Inactivated cell culture derived viral vaccines were immunogenic when administered to na\u00efve pigs. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of immunogenicity of an inactivated U.S. PEDV vaccine trial in pigs in the U.S.",

Confluent monolayers were washed three times with DMEM without serum prior to inoculation. For the initial infection of cells in 12-well plates, 200 \u03bcL of inoculum was adsorbed at 37\u00b0C with + 5% CO 2 for 1-2 hours with small amount of viral growth media (DMEM with 0.75 \u03bcg/mL ), L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)treated trypsin, and Normocin\u2122 antibiotic (Invivogen)). The inoculum was rinsed from the plates with viral growth media and the cells were refed with viral growth media. Plates were incubated up to 5 days before being frozen, thawed, and passaged. Subsequent passages were performed by inoculating 200 \u03bcL of cell culture harvest onto confluent monolayers in 12-well plates. Viral replication was verified by Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR) (below) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Viral cultures were scaled up in M145 25 cm 2 flasks and 1700 cm 2 roller bottles, resulting in NPL PEDV 2013 P10.1PEDV.",

A dose response was observed by FFN for vaccines containing different virus titers, with 8.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL groups all being significantly greater than 6.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL groups. Vaccines were administered IM or in the rear flank to determine if the site of administration would affect overall immunogenic response. The flank vaccination site was only tested on the 8.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL groups, as we expected them to have the highest immune response; however there was no significant difference between the two sites of administration. Likewise, there was no significant difference between vaccines formulated with Triton\u00ae X-100 treated antigen, by FFN. A challenge model is needed to correlate FFN and/or ELISA titers to protection. Surprisingly, with the exception of one pig, negative ELISA results were obtained from pigs vaccinated with Triton\u00ae X-100 treated virus formulated at 8.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL despite high FFN mean titers. The t-test shows Triton\u00ae X-100 treated groups were significantly different from non-Triton\u00ae X-100 treated groups at the same titer for ELISA and FMIA. Triton\u00ae X-100 detergent is used to create split-virion vaccines of influenza virus that are immunogenic and non-reactogenic [31] . Our data suggests that Triton\u00ae X-100 treatment of the PEDV antigen altered the antigenicity or immunogenicity of the NP, leading to negative ELISA results, while other immunogens capable of inducing a neutralizing antibody FMIA. An assay, such as the FFN, that detects functional neutralizing antibody associated with epitopes on the S protein may be better at quantifying antibody response to Triton\u00ae X-100 treated viruses. Few ELISAs targeting the S protein are readily available and they may also be subject to variations in protein conformation associated with Triton\u00ae X-100 treatment.",

Another study showed antibody was detected in serum from piglets and colostrum from pregnant sows after being inoculated with attenuated PEDV, though finding a specific protective antibody titer of the colostrum was complicated due to varying factors including litter size, colostrum uptake per piglet, antibody concentration, and quality of colostrum [20] .

In one case, piglets born from re-infected sows were reported to suffer around 30% mortality instead of near 100% during the first outbreak [33] . Further research is necessary to determine if secondary outbreaks in sows could be prevented via vaccination and or boosters. While this study focused on the humoral immune response in sera from vaccinated pigs, the post-vaccination immune response in sows and antibody titers in colostrum should be studied as the optimal vaccination regimen would utilize maternal antibodies to protect pigs when they are most susceptible to PEDV. Additionally, inactivated vaccines may prove efficacious when used as a booster in conjunction with live exposure or following MLV. If there is risk of re-infection among previously exposed herds, an inactivated vaccine booster to pregnant sows could reduce the occurrence of re-infection and limit secondary outbreaks. PEDV continues to be a source of economic loss and will continue to have a profound impact on the swine market in the U.S.",
