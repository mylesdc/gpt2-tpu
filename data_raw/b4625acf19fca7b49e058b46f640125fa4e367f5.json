NxTAG RPP gave sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 99.6%, PPV of 93.5%, and NPV of 99.7%. NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP had highly concordant performance among each other for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The mean analytic sensitivity (TCID50/ml) of NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP for detection of swine/avian-origin influenza A subtype isolates was 0.7, 41.8, and 0.8, respectively. All three multiplex assays correctly typed and genotyped the influenza viruses, except for NxTAG RRP that could not distinguish H3N2 from H3N2v. Further investigation should be performed if H3N2v is suspected to be the cause of disease. Sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis of all influenza A viruses subtypes is especially essential in certain epidemic regions, such as Southeast Asia.",

Rapid laboratory identification of RTI pathogens has been associated with up to 50% reduction in hospital stays, 30% reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and 20% reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures [9] . Multiplexed molecular assays that can concurrently detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction have been increasingly adopted in clinical microbiology laboratories in the recent years [10] .

With the emergence of human infections due to the swineorigin influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) virus in North America in 2010 and more recently the avian-origin influenza A H7N9 and H5N6 in China [13] [14] [15] , it would be important to ascertain the analytical sensitivities of these rapid tests for the novel influenza viruses [16, 17] .

It detects 22 viral and bacterial targets including influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype seasonal H1, influenza A virus subtype seasonal H3, influenza A virus subtype swine-origin H1N1pdm09, influenza B virus, RSV A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 4, adenovirus, hMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human coronavirus-(HCoV-) 229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila (Table 1) . Although there were several studies about the performance of NxTAG RPP using RUO (research use only) assay, the performance of the NxTAG RPP, CV-IVD, for detection of respiratory viruses, particularly the sensitivity and specificity of influenza A subtypes, remains unclear [18] [19] [20] .

These NPA samples were collected into a viral transport medium as described previously [21] and were tested by direct immunofluorescence (DFA) (D 3 [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . All these PCR results were used as positive reference. The remaining samples were then recruited for NxTAG RVP evaluation. A sufficient quantity of the samples was used for further testing with xTAG RVP and FilmArray RP. cells with tosyl sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-(TPCK-) treated trypsin (2 g/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as previously described [28] . Aliquots of culture supernatant were frozen at \u221280 \u2218 C until use. Serial tenfold dilutions of the virus stock with serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) were tested in NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP. The viral M gene genome copy numbers per ml of each virus dilution were determined by real-time, quantitative RT-PCR (q-PCR) as previously described with modification [29, 30] . Briefly, 5 L purified RNA was amplified in a 25 L reaction containing 0.5 L Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase/Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.05 L ROX reference dye (25 mM), 12.5 L of 2x reaction buffer, 800 nmol/L forward primer (5 -GACCRA-TCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3 ), 800 nmol/L reverse primer (5 -AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3 ), and probe 200 nmol/L (FAM-5 -TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGC-ACG-3 -BHQ1). The thermal cycling conditions were 30 minutes at 50 \u2218 C for reverse transcription and then 2 min at 95 \u2218 C for RT inactivation/initial denaturation, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u2218 C and 30 s at 55 \u2218 C. All reactions 18 20 were performed using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). For quantitative assay, a reference standard plasmid was prepared by cloning the target M gene amplicon into pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPO6 TA Cloning6 Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The copy number of the standard plasmid was determined based on molar concentration of the plasmid (1 molar is equivalent to about 6.0221415 \u00d7 10 23 copies numbers). A series of 6 log10 dilutions, equivalent to 1 \u00d7 10 1 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 copies per reaction, were then prepared from the reference standard plasmid to generate calibration curves and run in parallel with the test samples. The limit of detection of the M gene qRT-PCR is 10 copies per reaction at 95% confidence level. The same virus dilutions were inoculated onto MDCK cells to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) using the Reed-Muench method as previously described [28] .",

The mixture was added to 2 ml of lysis buffer and was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The lysed sample was then transferred to the well of a plastic vessel with 100 l of silica. This was followed by automatic magnetic separation. Nucleic acid was recovered in 110 l elution buffer. By using a parallel specimen (300 l), nucleic acid extraction, PCR, and detection were performed in FilmArray according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NxTAG RPP incorporates multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with the Luminex proprietary universal tag sorting system on the Luminex platform for detecting respiratory pathogen targets according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the extracted total nucleic acid is added to preplated Lyophilized Bead Reagents (LBRs) and mixed to resuspend the reaction reagents. The reaction is amplified via RT-PCR and the reaction product undergoes bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well.

We have previously shown that xTAG RVP has low sensitivity for detecting H7N9 [16, 17] . In this study, one of the patient specimens with confirmed H7N9 influenza A infection was also not detected by xTAG RVP influenza A but was detected by NxTAG RPP and FilmArray RP influenza A. xTAG RVP has a 1000 and 10 times higher limit of detection for H7N9 than NxTAG RPP and FilmArray RP, respectively (Table 3 ). These findings show that NxTAG RRP has greatly improved the sensitivity for detecting H7N9 over the xTAG RVP. Besides, NxTAG RPP has also improved sensitivity for detecting other respiratory viruses over xTAG RVP (1 adenovirus and 2 bocavirus). These findings corroborate another recent report on the partial comparison between the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay and the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Panel Fast Assay v2 [32] . NxTAG RPP detected 12 more pathogens than FilmArray RP in our study, with 50% (6/12) being enterovirus/rhinovirus. The other additional positives detected by NxTAG RPP were adenovirus (2), parainfluenza virus 4b (1), hMPV (1), H1N1pdm (1), and M. pneumoniae (1) . Overall, 8 positives, hMPV (1), P2 (1), P4 (3), enterovirus/rhinovirus (2), and M. pneumoniae (1), were not detected by NxTAG RPP. All these positives indeed had high Ct value (\u226535) that may be lower than the limit of detection by NxTAG RPP. Further study should be required if the primers that are suspected do not detect epidemic strains.",

The result will be interpreted as \"equivocal\" when only Flu A-pan-1 is positive, and the system will suggest the users to repeat testing by the same assay or other assays. In this study, the results showed that an \"equivocal\" result by FilmArray RP is most likely to be a true positive.

All three multiplex assays accurately typed and genotyped the influenza viruses, except for NxTAG RRP that does not distinguish subtyped H3N2 from H3N2v. This finding was further confirmed by testing another H3N2v strain, A/Indiana/08/2011, with 500TCID 50 .

The correct interpretation of these results is also important and would avoid delay in patient management and infection control, especially in patients with severe seasonal influenza A or avian/swine-origin influenza A virus subtype infection. Clinical microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and laboratory managers should be aware of and understand the different clinical performances of these commercially available molecular multiplex RT-PCR assays that are commonly adopted in many clinical microbiology laboratories. The sensitivity and specificity of these molecular multiplex assays must be predetermined and be able to confidently detect most of the important avian or swine influenza A subtype infection including H5N1 and H7N9 and this capability is particularly important for use in Southeast Asia.",
