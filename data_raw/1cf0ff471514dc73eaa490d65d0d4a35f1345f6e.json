During three months, a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) and distribution in age groups and results of RIDT were analyzed. (ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus. (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes. (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed.",

Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus. Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains. Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases.",

In order to capture cases from previously undetected chains of transmission, clusters of acute respiratory illness defined as at least three cases in a week in closed communities were also to be notified [1] . During the subsequent period, criteria used for requesting biological diagnosis were modified. The biological confirmation of suspected cases was no longer systematic, an increasing number of patients with influenzalike presentation and no history of travel abroad or contact with documented cases was tested, including grouped cases, severe or atypical presentations, patients with pre-existing condition etc. In addition, a Point Of Care (POC) strategy was applied from June 23 rd for the Public Hospitals of Marseilles [2] (see figure 1) .",

Interestingly, the proportion of influenza infections caused by seasonal H3N2 constantly decreased during the period of the study (final value ,5%), but the absolute number of cases observed weekly remained roughly constant, suggesting that seasonal influenza circulated at low rate during this summer period (a phenomenon never observed previously and which may reflect the previous poor performance of the routine surveillance systems implemented for respiratory infections) and that this circulation was not markedly modified by the increasing number of cases of H1N1sw infections.",

OPYFLU-1 and OPYFLU-58 HA protein sequences were identical (with 3 synonymous substitutions) but 2 non-synonymous differences were detected in the NA gene (V106I, N248D) in addition to 3 non-synonymous mutations. There was no evidence of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in either strain. Interestingly, strains appeared to segregate according to the nature of residues 106 and 248. When using amino acid sequences, various methods used for tree building (including distance-based neighbor joining and maximum parsimony reconstructions) provided a similar topology, with VN strains appearing ancestral, separate clusters including VD and IN sequences and finally a large group of ID sequence that seemed to have emerged more recently from a common ancestor (see figure 10A ). This chronology is globally validated by the analysis of dates at which the corresponding strains were collected (see figure 10B ). However, bootstrap resampling values at forks delineating the main clusters are low (,50), a possible consequence of the limited genetic distances between the different strains studied.

Our analysis of this limited sample did not identify associations between age and specific pathogens. It provided results in agreement with those previously published by Follin and collaborators [23] and confirmed the difficult etiological identification of ILIs based on clinical presentation. One interesting aspect of this study was the identification of ''seasonal'' H3N2 influenza virus in June, July and August, which cocirculated at a low rate with the pandemic H1N1sw virus. This may appear to be an unusual feature in Southern France during summertime, but strongly suggests that such cases occur regularly and are just not detected by our standard surveillance system which focuses on investigations during the winter season. Therefore, the characteristics of the circulation of the influenza A virus may be much more complex than previously believed and our results suggest that the complete picture may include the circulation of ''seasonal'' virus during the April-August period in Figure 8 .

This pattern was progressively modified and, notably, the number of patients who did not travel and could not identify any link with suspected cases, as well as the number of patients under the age of 10 tested for H1N1sw infection, increased progressively. The final picture (see figures 3B and 4) is very similar to the epidemiological distribution of H1N1 seasonal virus usually observed in age groups, with ,50% of cases under the age of 20, a decreasing number of cases in age groups over the age of 20 and, notably, a very limited number of cases in patients over 60 years old. Superimposing the curves of empirical cumulative distribution of ages for patients with seasonal H1N1 in New York State during the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 influenza seasons, and for H1N1sw in Panel C shows a striking similarity. Only one difference is observed in the 2-12 years old age group, in which the number of cases is slightly lower in our series. However, it must be noted that, in the current study, the investigation of clusters of cases (implicating a majority of children under the age of 15) was limited to sampling a few individuals per cluster. Therefore, the actual number of cases in children was underestimated and is most probably similar to that reported for seasonal H1N1 by [20] (in the latter study, 47% of the detected H1N1 cases were reported in patients younger than 20 years). The most remarkable difference observed by [20] between seasonal H1N1 (and thus H1N1sw) and H3N2 distribution, is the number of cases occurring in the elderly, (H1N1 does preferentially target a younger population). One reason that may underlie this difference is the weaker antigenic drift in H1N1, associated with co-circulation of multiple H1N1 lineages and weaker H1N1 bottleneck effects between seasons compared to those of H3N2 [20, 24] . Indeed, in the current series the number of cases detected in patients over 60 years old is remarkably low: less than 1% in both Panels B and C whilst this age group provided 10.5% of the patients tested in these two panels.",

Since it is extremely improbable that strains related to H1N1sw circulated in human populations during the last 20 or 30 years, the value observed for young patients is likely to be due to cross reactivity with seasonal influenza and thus indicative of the global overestimation of the prevalence provided by the HI assay (according to this hypothesis, around 10%). In individuals over 40, the prevalence is clearly disconnected from that observed for seasonal viruses and suggests previous exposure (presumably before 1970) to influenza virus(es) antigenically related to the current H1N1sw. However, much earlier circulation (i.e. before 1940 and possibly between the first and the Second World War) of H1N1sw-related strains cannot be ruled out considering the high prevalence values observed for patients over 80.",

We found that the positive predictive and specificity values of the RIDTs used were 100% and that the sensitivity in the age group 0-15 was 75%. Comparative analyses with studies investigating the performance of RIDTs suggest that the RIDT used in the current study performs better than others. This deserves further investigation. However, it also suggests that RIDT may be useful for rapid investigation of clusters of paediatric cases, and that they may also be particularly useful at the peak of the outbreak: we could calculate that (in the case of children under the age of 15 and under the hypothesis of a ratio of 2 between the price of the molecular test and that of the RIDT) the cost of a strategy associating a systematic RIDT and a molecular test for all negatives would become more attractive than systematically testing all samples by molecular biology for prevalence of influenza infection over 60%.",

            "text": "Another conclusion that could be drawn from the use of RIDTs is, in the case of H1N1sw, the more important viral excretion in children under the age of 15 compared with other age groups (see figure 6A ). Actually, children were associated with the highest sensitivity of the test and, simultaneously, positive results of RIDTs could be associated with elevated viral loads (see figure 6B ). This confirms previous results showing that the highest attack rates of seasonal influenza observed in communities of schoolchildren are accounted for by the shedding of higher titres of virus for a longer period than other patient groups [21, 22] . In the specific case of H1N1sw, similar results were observed suggesting that clinical attack rates in children under 15 years of age in La Gloria were twice those observed in adults [25] .",

Interestingly, the attack rate observed in children (median age 11) was similar to that observed in young adults supervising them (median age 22). This strongly suggests that the shedding of higher titres of virus by children is the major parameter associated with high attack rates. However, it was also noticed that attack rates in children increased with age sub-groups, the risk of infection among teenagers being 3 times the risk of the youngest (under 8 years old). This difference may be, in the case of the current investigation, explained in part by the physical separation of children in different groups, but may also reflect specific behaviour or susceptibility to infection in different age groups.",

            "text": "Finally, the genetic characterisation of a strain isolated in the early period (May) of the outbreak from a patient returning from Mexico, and that of a strain isolated in July 2009 from a French autochthonous case revealed two mutations at positions 106 and 248 of the neuraminidase protein. Residue 106 is located at the N terminus of the neuraminidase domain and closely related to the trans-membrane domain. Residue 248 is located at the surface of the protein and part of an antibody recognition site [26] . It may therefore be associated with antigenic shift. The N248D mutation has previously been reported in H1N1 human strains isolated in the thirties, forties, seventies, eighties and nineties. Sequence analysis suggests that a majority of strains harboured the V 106 -N 248 pattern at the origin of the outbreak. After May 2009, the decline of V 106 -N 248 strains was concomitant with the emergence of I 106 -D 248 strains. The mechanism of emergence of ID strains remains unclear: such strains may have emerged from a common ancestor and disseminated secondarily, but this hypothesis is epidemiologically puzzling and poorly supported by phylogenetic analyses in other genes such as HA. The alternative hypothesis (a common selection process may have lead to convergent evolution towards ID strains originating from various VN ancestors) cannot be ruled out and would suggest that evolutionary constraints led to the decline of V106-N248 strains after May 2009 and the emergence of I106-D248. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been associated to date with a change in the epidemiology or clinical presentation of the viral infection, but certainly deserves a careful follow up during the coming months.",

Six hundred sera distributed in 4 age groups (0-19, 20-39, 40-59 and .60) were randomly selected in this collection, until an equal number of 150 sera in each age group was reached. Antibodies to the new H1N1sw virus were detected and quantified by the standard hemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique. The antigen was prepared from cell culture supernatant medium obtained following a seven-day propagation of strain OPYFLU-1 at high m.o.i. onto MDCK cells. Serial dilutions of heat-decomplemented serum (1/20-1/5,120), four viral hemagglutinating units and a suspension of human erythrocytes (group O, final concentration: 0.5%) were used in a final volume of 50 mL. In addition, a subgroup of 300 randomly selected human serum samples was tested using antigens from seasonal influenza viruses, i.e. one strain of seasonal H1N1 (Marseille-2007), and one strain of seasonal H3N2 (Marseille-2008).",
