Traditional mathematical models usually assume a homogeneous mixing in the population, which is rarely the case in reality. Here, we construct a new transmission function by using as the probability density function a negative binomial distribution, and we develop a compartmental model using it to model the heterogeneity of contact rates in the population. We explore the transmission dynamics of the developed model using numerical simulations with different parameter settings, which characterize different levels of heterogeneity. The results show that when the reproductive number, R 0 , is larger than one, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing model. As the level of heterogeneity increases, the dynamics become more different. As a test case, we calibrated the model with the case incidence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003, and the estimated parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of the control measures taken during that period.",

First, traditional compartmental models were extended: the infection term of the homogeneous mixing compartmental models was modified [7] [8] [9] . The compartments were further divided into multiple subgroups with similar behavioral characteristics (e.g., risk [10] ) or demography (e.g., age [11, 12] ). Second, along with the rapid development in research on complex networks, a large body of literature has examined the effects of the heterogeneous contact structure on disease spread in networks [13, 14] . The third type of modeling approach considering heterogeneity is agent-based modeling [15] [16] [17] , which characterizes the heterogeneity in individual attributes and behaviors. Additionally, several researchers have attempted to bridge the gap between traditional compartmental models and individual-based models [18] [19] [20] .",

Let X i represent the number of effective contacts (the number of contacts that would be sufficient for transmitting the disease successfully, were it to occur between a susceptible individual and an infectious individual [21, 22] ) with infectious individuals of the i-th susceptible person per unit time. Assume that X i has a Poisson distribution \u03c0(\u03b8 i ), where \u03b8 i is the mean of the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. That \u03b8 i are identical means that each individual has an equal chance of effective contact with infectious individuals and an equal chance of being infected, thereby resulting in a traditional homogeneous-mixing model. In reality, however, individuals typically come into contact with only a small, clustered, subpopulation [20] . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that different individuals have different average effective numbers of contacts in a certain period of time; that is, \u03b8 i is itself a random variable. The Gamma distribution is a good choice for describing \u03b8 i for a variety of reasons: it is bounded on the left at zero (the numbers of contact must be non-negative), is positively skewed (it has non-zero probability of an extremely high number of contacts) and can represent a variety of distribution shapes [23] . It has been used to describe the expected number of secondary cases caused by a particular infected individual [24] . Therefore, we assume a Gamma distribution for \u03b8 i , with shape parameter k, rate parameter m (or scale parameter 1 m ) and the following probability distribution function:",

The infection process is represented in Figure 1 . Children are born susceptible to the disease and enter the compartment S. A susceptible individual in compartment S is infected after effective contact with an infectious individual in compartment I and then enters the exposed compartment E. After the latent period ends, the individual enters the compartment I and becomes capable of transmitting the infection. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the recovered class R and will never be infected again [4, 22] . In each compartment, individual death occurs at a constant rate, \u00b5, which is equal to the birth rate. Death induced by the disease is not considered here. Therefore, the total population size in the model, N, remains unchanged. The SEIR model and its extension have been used to model many infectious diseases, for example, measles [30] [31] [32] , rubella [33, 34] , influenza [35, 36] and SARS [37, 38] , among others.

The results show that the infectious curves with fixed \u03b2, but different values of k achieve a peak after a period that is almost the same in duration (Figure 2A) . However, the transmission speed and, therefore, the peak size, as well as the dynamics after the peak are very different. A low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model with a frequency-dependent transmission term, \u03b2SI N . This is consistent with the conclusion inferred in Equation (2). As the value of k decreases, that is the level of heterogeneity increases, the dynamics differ increasingly from those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model. The greatest difference is that at the overall level, the heterogeneity slows the transmission speed and decreases the peak sizes, which means milder disease outbreaks, because in the scenario with a high level of heterogeneity, only a small proportion of susceptible individuals have chances of coming into contact with infectious individuals and becoming infected, which results in a slower increase of the infected population. Second, after the peak is attained, the infectious curves do not decline as rapidly as those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model and the NBD models (Equation (4)) with larger values of k (Figure 2A) , and the disease persists over a long term in the population ( Figure 2B ). Compared to the homogeneous-mixing model or the NBD models with larger values of k, up to the peak time (almost the same), there are many more individuals who are still susceptible to the disease. A proportion of them come into contact with infectious individuals and become infected, and this process persists for a long period of time. Moreover, Figure 2B shows that the endemic sizes of the two scenarios are approximately equal, just as noted in the previous section. In addition, when k drops to a very small value, there will be no disease outbreak, because almost none of the susceptible individuals have any chance of coming into contact with infectious individuals and becoming infected. It is shown that the contact patterns exhibit more heterogeneity than that assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but they do not appear extremely heterogeneous [6] .",

In total, 2048 confirmed cases were reported during the entire outbreak period (the circle markers shown in Figure 4 ; the data were provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Prompted by the rapid expansion of the epidemic, on 17 April, the Beijing municipal government established a Joint SARS Leading Group and deployed 10 task forces to oversee crisis management [41, 42] . On 20 April, a larger number of cases was reported, and the Chinese government canceled the May Day holiday in an effort to reduce the mass movement of people [43] . Multiple measures were taken to control the spread of the disease, including the provision of personal protective equipment and training for healthcare workers [41] ; introduction of community-based prevention and control through case detection, isolation, quarantine and community mobilization [41] ; closure of the sites of public entertainment and schools [42] ; and stopping the entry of all visitors or screening them for fever upon entry to universities and other places [42] . Additionally, a general increase in SARS awareness played an important role in controlling the outbreak [42] . The multiple measures implemented in Beijing likely led to the rapid resolution of the SARS outbreak [42] . To evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures taken in Beijing at that time, we calibrated the NBD model to the data of the SARS daily cases using the GlobalSearch algorithm in the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox [44, 45] and estimated the parameters. We used two different values, k 1 and k 2 , to characterize the different levels of heterogeneity in contact in the population before and after 20 April [38] . We assumed a fixed value for \u03b2 for simplicity (in reality, the value of \u03b2 decreased along with the control strategies [38] ; we mainly discuss the influence of the other parameter, k). We chose the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) [46] as the goodness of fit between the model output and the daily case data, as well as the objective function of the calibration procedure. In order to compute the NRMSE, we solved the set of differential equations (Equation (4)) with unknown parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and k = k 1 from 7 March to 20 April. The initial conditions were set as follows: S(0) = 1.4564 \u00d7 10 7 , which was the size of the permanent population in Beijing in 2003 [47] ; t = 0 corresponds to 7 March 2003; E(0) = 0; I(0) = 2, which was the number of daily cases on 7 March 2003; and R(0) = 0. Then, the output of the model on 20 April was taken as the initial value to solve Equation (4) with parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and k = k 2 from 20 April to 4 June. Finally, the two outputs were combined and used to calculate the goodness of fit to the SARS daily case data. The birth and death rate, \u00b5, was assumed to be 1/70 year \u22121 . In total, there were five unknown parameters to be estimated: k 1 , k 2 , \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3.",

To address heterogeneous-mixing within populations, the populations were further divided into multiple subgroups [10] [11] [12] , and used the WAIFW matrix (\"who acquires infection from whom\" [1] ), in which any individual is more likely to come into contact with other individuals from within the same subgroup than those outside. However, in this framework, contact rates within the subgroups are still homogeneous. A different class of approaches for extending the traditional compartmental models to incorporate heterogeneity involves modifying the transmission term; our approach belongs to this class. The work in [7, 8, 19] replaced the bilinear transmission term (SI) in the homogeneous compartmental model with a nonlinear term kS p I q , where k, p, q are the \"heterogeneity parameters\". Their results showed that the modified model was capable of predicting the disease transmission patterns in a clustered network [19] . Stroud et al. used a power-law scaling of the new infection rate I(S/N) v , with scaling power v greater than one, to relax the homogeneous-mixing assumption [9] , and it was demonstrated that this power-law formulation leads to significantly lower predictions of the final epidemic size than the traditional linear formulation. Compared to these empirical or semi-empirical modifications [7] [8] [9] 19] , the NBD transmission function seems to agree more with the real transmission mechanics, in that it assumes that the mean of the number of effective contacts of the susceptible individuals with infectious individuals per unit time is different from individual to individual, and the choice of the Gamma distribution offers multiple advantages (see Section 2.1).",

Keeling et al. reviewed multiple types of networks and the statistical and analytical approaches for the spread of infectious diseases [13, 14] . In particular, Bansal et al. demonstrated that the high-level heterogeneous degree distributions generate an almost immediate expansion phase compared to homogeneous degree distributions, such as the Poisson distribution [6, 49, 50] . The NBD-SEIR model does not exhibit this feature. We suspect that this is because our approach belongs to the mean-field class of approaches and considers a large population at the overall level. In addition, it is possible to approximate the main features of disease spread in networks with compartmental models using an appropriate construction. The work in [20] used R 0 as a fundamental parameter to formulate a mean-field type model, which can implicitly capture some important effects of heterogeneous-mixing in contact networks. The work in [51, 52] applied \"edge-based compartmental modeling\" (EBCM), which focuses on the status of a random partner rather than a random individual, to capture the heterogeneous contact rates in disease transmission.",

The developed model considers the heterogeneity of contact rates in the population. The simulation results show that, at the population level, the dynamics vary widely according to the level of heterogeneity in contact rates. Once R 0 > 1, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing models. Keeping other conditions identical, as the level of heterogeneity increases, the transmission speed becomes more and more slowly, the peak size becomes smaller and smaller. These results have implications for developing interventions, such as isolation, targeted vaccination, among others.",
