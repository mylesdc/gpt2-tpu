The focus was in particular on the application of these technologies for the improvement of patient diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and for other broad public health outcomes. The presentations by scientists and clinicians showed the potential of deep sequencing technology to capture the coevolution of adaptive immunity and pathogens. For clinical applications, some key challenges remain, such as the long turnaround time and relatively high cost of deep sequencing for pathogen identification and characterization and the lack of international standardization in immune repertoire analysis.",

Immune cells of the adaptive immune response, namely the T and B cells, share the fascinating capacity to generate a huge number of different receptors to bind to any given antigen. During a lifetime of repeated exposure and infection to pathogens, each human being generates his or her own repertoire of expanded clones that constitute the \"immune memory\" (Figure 1) . The capacity to bind to and eliminate foreign antigens that enter the organism has evolved over time under pressure from pathogens that can adopt just as much sequence variability as the immune repertoire. Hence, the pathogen is an important variable in the process. Both immune and pathogen repertoires can be assessed with deep sequencing (or next-generation sequencing, NGS), which has seen major advances in technology, throughput, and analytical methods over the last several years and even months (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . To build on these advances, the ambition of the workshop organizers was to showcase outstanding science from both immune-and pathogen repertoire deep sequencing studies, to begin to think about a combined analysis of both sides since one is shaped by the other (Figure 1) .",

Dunn-Walters highlighted that older people will constitute an increasingly larger proportion of the population in developed countries, which has implications for herd immunity. Although general characteristics were shared between old people, B cell repertoires were specific for each individual. In general, the immunoglobulin M memory response decreased in older people and the isotype distribution changed, which might be attributed to a declining T helper cell response. The complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) is a mutation hot spot of the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region and is highly mutated during affinity maturation. It constitutes a major determinant of each B cell's specificity. By sequencing CDR3 regions of B cells from young and old individuals, Dunn-Walters found that negative selection in the bone marrow appears to be less stringent in older people, evidenced by a higher percentage of long CDR3s in transitional and naive B cells (6) . Long CDR3s have been associated with autoimmunity. In turn, Dunn-Walters proposes that short CDR3s are associated with more efficient vaccine responses. Repertoire differences associated with age also include the usage of kappa and lambda light chains, whose CDR3s are structurally different, as new research in the Dunn-Walter lab shows. Patrick Wilson commented that it would be interesting to study the entire light chain variable regions and to possibly swap CDR3 regions to assess structure-function differences.",

Diversification of antibody repertoires in the periphery occurs via affinity maturation and via class switching. For the former, the mutation rate is about 10 \u22123 mutations per base pair. Horns proposed the concept of selective sweeps in B cell affinity maturation. Selective sweeps constitute beneficial mutations retained during evolution. He analyzed B cell repertoires for signatures of repeated selective sweeps and found such signatures, which he proposed as a mechanism to increase affinity maturation. This was illustrated in a graph of vaccine-responsive lineages that were small compared to larger persistent lineages.",

Horns and Vollmers found that constant Ig genes more distal to the assembled variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes, which together form the variable (or VDJ) region of a B cell receptor (BCR), were mostly used via indirect class switching when looking across all sequences. For sister cells within the same clonal lineage, the same isotype usage was found in most instances for closely related clones but less consistently for less related clones (lower% identity). Horns hypothesized an impact of extrinsic factors in the same signaling niche, but also proposed intrinsic factors of cellular epigenetic states that bias switching toward particular classes and are heritable during cell division.",

Antigen-specific, nonrandom CDR3 usage was only evident in recall responses, not in acute plasmablast responses.

Ideally, sequencing reads should extend even further into the constant region to allow for the identification of isotype subtypes. Vollmers, therefore, devised a method to sequence the entire IgH variable region by employing tagmentation of full-length PCR amplicons and by assembling 2 \u00d7 150 paired end reads from three libraries prepared per amplicon. This method can cover reads up to 900 bp. It is published and also available on his lab homepage (10) . 3 Vollmers is also exploring new avenues for obtaining longer reads that can be used for applications such as the analysis of constant region splice variants, and he shared his experience with Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), which has developed a small sequencing device that can be plugged into a computer via USB (Box 1). Vollmers described having successfully performed a sequencing run during a 3-h car trip from the sample collection point to UCSC. Since existing RNAseq tools are not useful to analyze Nanopore data, Chris used BLAT for read alignment and wrote scripts for RNA quantification and identification of isoforms. Besides its advantages, ONT technology is still relatively immature and flow cells can often fail. Cost wise, 300,000 10K reads cost about 500 USD (at the time when the workshop was held).",

Wilson's group found that a high percentage of CD21 low cells were antigen-specific and could, therefore, be a source for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies. CD21 low clades within distinct clones were related to both plasmablasts and memory B cells.

Leslie argued that vaccines should instead generate T cells for antigens that occur specifically in the lung, so-called resident memory T cells, which had been suggested before to correlate with protection (15) . The study material used to analyze T cells was resected lung tissue from TB-infected subjects, providing a unique opportunity to assess cells from human tissue. T cells were highly enriched in TB-infected lung homogenates, containing a higher proportion of CD8 + T cells compared to tonsils. Compared to blood, TB-specific cells in the lung were up to 10-fold enriched as shown with a tetramer stain. Since enzymelinked immunospot assay was impossible with the limited cell numbers available in the samples, Leslie employed commercial T cell receptor (TCR) clonotyping from DNA (Adaptive Inc.) to analyze potential disease-specific clones. First results showed a higher clonality in lungs and overlapping repertoires between granulomas in different lung lobes. Converging sequences were observed between lungs from different donors, suggesting that there were TB-specific motifs. However, TB specificity will have to be proven. Besides CD8 T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells contained converging sequences and evidence of selection.",

He and his collaborators found that bacteria on AD skin have a greater potential to convert arginine to ammonia compared to healthy skin, facilitating increase in pH and Staphylococcus aureus colonization (3). The protective potential of skin-resident bacteria provides an alternative version of the hygiene hypothesis.

Clinicians on a daily basis encounter more often the culture-negative scenario, potentially due to a too small sample. Additionally, there are unculturable pathogens like intracellular bacteria that do not grow on agar or viruses etc. And then of course there is also the case where the patient takes antibiotics and the bacteria are wiped out already. Routinely, what we do now is to take those samples and do 16S or 18S sequencing to know what species we are looking at. But the challenge with this is that we do not know whether the nucleic acid is actually offending, hence when we get a staphylococcus non-aureus species, we do not know what that means for the patient. We do not have an antibiogram to tell us whether that species is resistant or not. Deep sequencing has been proposed as a solution for this problem, to sequence the whole genome, but then the problem of host genomic material comes in. The best example in this context is from a 2014 NEJM report of a child with meningitis of unknown origin (21) . After full genome sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid 475 of 3,063,784 reads of a leptospirosis species were found. The patient was successfully treated and the diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and serology. It is really challenging to hit that sweet spot. We are waiting for someone to give us those pull-down technologies to enrich for pathogen nucleic acid.",

There is progress by starting with simplistic situations, for example, if you have a bunch of TCRs specific to flu that bind to a certain MHC you can compare this to a set of TCRs that do not bind to flu and train the system.

There are several companies who offer T-and B-cell sequencing of bulk-sorted cells as a service, combined with analysis pipelines that provide ready graphs and illustrations to customers. However, deeper analysis of, for example, the entire VDJ region, Ig isotypes, or Ig isotype splice variants, still need specialized technologies that are mostly developed and used by individual research groups. If the combination of alpha/beta chain for T cells or the combination of heavy and light chains of B cells is required, single-cell technologies are necessary. The latest expectation, however, is not only paired chains of TCR or BCR sequences but information on additional genes expressed in immune cells. iRepertoire's iPair technology allows us to sequence a limited number of mRNAs besides the TCR or BCR. Genome-wide mRNA sequencing technologies also become more established. Chip-based technologies as the one from Fluidigm are constantly improving in throughput, cell capture rate, and sensitivity. TCR sequence assembly from single-cell whole genome RNAseq data has been reported (22) , while assembling BCR sequences from RNAseq data is now also possible, as presented by Patrick Wilson (13) . Fluidigm currently has an 800-cell-capacity chip available. Droplet-based technologies, as the one from HiFiBio presented at the workshop, promise higher throughput but a lower sequencing depth per cell compared to Fluidigm's technology might have to be considered as a trade-off.",
