It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus. In conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of China, 2008.",

The viral genome contains a 5'-and 3'untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for viral RNA replication. The genome is translated as a single large polyprotein that is composed of four capsid proteins, VP1 to VP4, and seven nonstructural proteins, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. VP1 to VP4 capsid proteins were encoded by P1 region.

In addition, the identification of HEV71 infection was hampered by the sudden death of 22 children within 5 days of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, heart and lung failure. RT-PCR and sequencing were primarily performed to identify the virological etiology of the outbreak. Laboratory testing showed that 39% of the cases were confirmed as HEV71 infection.

The findings were consistent with studies of the 1997 outbreak in Malaysia and the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan, in which manifestations of HEV71 infections predominate with neurological complications in fatal or severe cases [2, 3] . Analyses of the VP1 sequence showed high homology between severe or fatal cases and mild HFMD cases and no significant nucleotide differences were found. Other groups have also studied the complete genome of HEV71 isolated from fatal and non-fatal HFMD cases and found no genetic differences that could be correlated with the severity of clinical manifestation [12, 13] . Studies on the pathogenic mechanism for HEV71 have pointed to altered innate immunity. An epidemiologic study during the same outbreak implicated treatment of initial fever of HEV71 infections with glucocorticoids, which block the innate immune response, as contributing to the high rate of severe disease [14] . Experimental animal and clinical studies also support this finding indicating that weakened innate immunity is associated with severe disease and death from HEV71 infection [15] [16] [17] . This in combination with introduction of the new recombinant virus may help to explain the increased severity of the Fuyang outbreak. In this study, genetic recombination event were found between the Fuyang HEV71 isolates, including both fatal cases and non-fatal cases, and CV-A16, which was similar to other studies [18, 19] . For enteroviruses [20] and dengue viruses [21] , genetic recombination is a well-known phe-nomenon and recombination could result in the emergence of viruses with altered pathogenic potentials. Except for the Fuyang HEV71 isolates, genetic recombination was also found in the HEV71 viruses, circulated in mainland of China during 1998-2008. However, it was very difficult to clarify the time of recombination and the role of the HEV71 recombinant in HFMD outbreaks remains unclear.",

The C4 subgenotype of HEV71 was initially identified in Guangdong province in 1998 and has been continuously circulating for at least 10 years [10] , which may reflect the pattern of endemic circulation of subgenotype C4 viruses.

Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackie-virus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus.",

All patients (or the guardians of the children patients or relatives of fatal or comatose patients) gave oral informed consent. Direct reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using different sets of primers for panenteroviruses [23] ; HEV71 [8] and CV-A16 [8] . Human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cell lines were used to isolate viruses from clinical specimens.
