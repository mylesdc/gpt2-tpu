            "text": "The chaos game representation (CGR) based on an iterative function system was firstly proposed for the representation of DNA sequences by Jeffrey in 1990 [22] . The Jeffrey's CGR is drawn within a quadrate with four vertices referring to nucleotides A, C, G and T. The first point is placed halfway between the center of the quadrate and the vertex corresponding to the first nucleotide of the sequence. The i-th (i > 1) point is placed halfway between the (i-1)-th point and the vertex corresponding to the i-th nucleotide. Being capable of discovering the inner pattern of gene sequences, CGR has been widely used in the investigation of DNA sequences [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Encouraged by the CGR of DNA sequences, the CGR of protein sequences has also been extensively studied by many researchers. Fisher et al. [29] first proposed an improved CGR of protein sequences, which was produced in a 20-side regular polygon with 20-vertices representing 20 kinds of amino acid. Randi\u0107 et al. [30] constructed the CGR of protein sequences in the interior of a unit circle, on the circumference of which 20 amino acids are located uniformly according to the alphabet order of their three letter codes.",

Therefore, physicochemical properties of amino acids have been widely used in protein sequence studies, such as similarity analysis of protein sequences, prediction of protein subcellular localization and protein structural class prediction [2-15, 18-20, 31-38] . In [39] , Randi\u0107 mentioned that ordering amino acids based on their physicochemical properties may offer better insights in comparative studies of proteins than representations of proteins based on alphabetical ordering of amino acids, which is essentially equivalent to random ordering. Following Randi\u0107's approach, He et al. [31, 40] proposed some different cyclic orders for the 20 amino acids to introduce the CGRs of protein sequences based on the physicochemical properties of amino acids. We denote the above CGRs by 20-CGR as 20 kinds of letters are used to represent protein sequences. Basu et al. [41] used a 12-sided regular polygon to generate the 12-CGR of protein sequences, each vertex of which represents a group of amino acids based on the conservative substitutions. Later Yu et al. [32] and Manikandakumar et al. [33] proposed 4-CGR, 5-CGR and 6-CGR for protein sequences, in which 4, 5 and 6 kinds of letters were used to represent protein sequences, respectively. In fact, using reduced amino acid alphabet to represent a protein sequence would easily result in loss of sequence information, since the amino acids belonging to the same group are considered identical.",

The key issue in the application of CGR is to extract as many useful features as possible from CGR and several studies showed that those extracted features plays important roles in protein studies [25-28, 31, 34-38, 40-42] . One of the most frequently used feature extraction methods is the so-called FCGR, in which the CGR image is split into small grids and the frequencies of points falling into each grid are taken as the feature of the corresponding protein sequence. For example, in [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] 41] , the CGR image of a protein sequence was split into 24 grids, and the frequencies of points falling into 24 grids are counted and taken as the numerical characteristics of the protein sequence. Under this procedure, a protein sequence can be converted into a 24-dimensional vector. Although FCGR method could effectively extract useful information from CGR, however, it loses the distribution information of the points in each grid, which is proved of great importance in this paper.",

In the group of fishes, all the TFs from Salmonidae are clustered together and form a separate branch. In addition, the TFs belonging to Salmo (Atlantic salmon TF, Brown trout TF), Salvelinus (Lake trout TF, Brook trout TF, Japanese char TF) and Oncorhynchus (Chinook salmon TF, Coho salmon TF, Sockeye salmon TF, Rainbow trout TF, Amago salmon TF) are also correctly clustered and form separate branches, respectively. All these results are completely consistent with known evolutionary relationships. The phylogenetic tree constructed by DCGR is also great consistent with that obtained in [54] (see Additional file 1: Figure S16 for details), which is the most classical result among all the known. However, Possum TF is erroneously clustered in [54] , which directly demonstrates that the DCGR is more reliable.

Antifreeze proteins are a class of proteins produced by certain vertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria that permit their survival in subzero environments by binding to small ice crystals to inhibit growth and recrystallization of ice. The 27 AFPs were selected from Choristoneura fumiferana (CF), Tenebrio molitor (TM), Hypogastrura harveyi (HH), Dorcus curvidens binodulosus (DCB), Microdera dzhungarica punctipennis (MDP) and Dendroides Canadensis (DC), whose taxonomic information and accession numbers are provided in Additional file 1: Table S4 . After feature extractions of the 27 AFPs by DCGR, the standardized Euclidean distance was used to calculate the distance matrix, and the phylogenetic tree of the 27 AFPs was constructed in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5 , it clearly shows that the AFPs of the same species are accurately grouped together. In addition, the HH protein has a far relationship with each of the other 26 AFPs, which is consistent with the result in [56] . However, all the other compared methods [43, 52, 55] including ClustalW cannot accurately group all the proteins into respective taxonomic classes.
