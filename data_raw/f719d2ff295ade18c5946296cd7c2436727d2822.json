This processing is considered to be a suitable antiviral target because it is required for viral maturation. Unfortunately, initial screening of the existing SARS-CoV PL pro inhibitor, a benzodioxolane derivative against MERS-CoV PL pro , revealed no significant inhibition [7] . The difference represents the requirement of further understanding the MERS-CoV PL pro . In addition to proteolytic activity, similar to those of SARS-CoV, NL63-CoV and murine hepatitis virus, MERS-CoV PL pro acts on both deubiquitination and ISG15-linked ISGylation [8] [9] [10] [11] . As a viral deubiquitinating protease (DUB), MERS-CoV PL pro is able to deubiquitinate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which can prevent its nuclear translocation and suppress production of interferon \u03b2 [10] . These studies support the multifunctional nature of coronaviral PL pro . Recently, with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PL pro C112S mutant in complex with ubiquitin (Ub), we have demonstrated that Ub core (residue 1-72) makes mostly hydrophilic interactions with PL pro , while the Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly C-terminus of Ub is located in the catalytic cleft of PL pro , mimicking the P4-P1 residues [12] . This bound pattern is similar to that of the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), one of the five distinct DUB families [13, 14] .",

Homology modeling suggests that MERS-CoV PL pro , similar to other known PL pro , may have a right-hand-like architecture constituted by palm, thumb, and fingers domains, although their sequence identity are only about 30% [12] . Furthermore, MERS-CoV PL pro is able to recognize and cleave at the LXGG consensus cleavage site, which is essential for most CoV PL pro -mediated processing [10] .

Fluorescence intensity was converted to the amount of hydrolyzed substrate using a standard curve drawn from the fluorescence measurements of well-defined concentrations of Dabcyl-FRLKGG and APIKGV-Edans peptides in a 1:1 ratio.

For the kinetic analysis, the reaction mixture contained 4-50 \u03bcM peptide substrate in 50 mM phosphate pH 6.5 in a total volume of 1 mL. After the addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture, the increase in fluorescence was continuously monitored at 30\u00b0C. The increase in fluorescence was linear for at least 3 min, and thus the slope of the line represented the initial velocity (v).

Finally, it was found that the STAR strain showed the best expression efficiency. After expressing the protein in E. coli and purification by nickel affinity chromatography and gel-filtration, the purity of recombinant PL pro was about 99% ( Figure 1A ). The size of the recombinant MERS-CoV PL pro was found to be between 30 and 45 kDa, which conforms to the theoretical mass (36.5 kDa). The typical yield was about 42 mg after purification from 0.8 liter of E. coli culture (Table 1) . After gel-filtration chromatography, the specific proteolytic activity of PL pro was 4 U/mg, increased by 5-fold, with 49.4% recovery rate. Furthermore, the recombinant MERS-CoV PL pro was digested by trypsin and then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry to confirm the amino acid sequence (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The molecular weight of fifteen peptides, which covered 60% amino acid sequence, was observed and confirmed ( Figure 1B and Figure 1C ). It indicated that our expression and purification of MERS-CoV PL pro by E. coli is successful. For convenience, in the present studies, the MERS-CoV PL pro domain (polyprotein 1a 1484-1800) is numbered to residue 2 to 317, while the first residue is a methionine.",

On the other hand, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the native MERS-CoV PL pro shows a maximum at 336 nm, while that of the unfolded one shifts to 340 nm. The tendency is similar to that of SARS-CoV PL pro [19] and suggests a folded structure. Next, we also performed AUC experiments to characterize the quaternary structure of MERS-CoV PL pro . Figure 4A shows a typical absorbance trace at 280 nm of the PL pro during the experiment. After fitting the signals to a continuous size-distribution model, it was clear that the PL pro was monomeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S and molar mass of 35.5 kDa ( Figure 4B and Figure 4C ), consistent with that for SARS-CoV PL pro [12, 19] . All of these biophysical observation confirmed that the PL pro of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV should have a very similar structure; albeit they only show 30% sequence identity and 50% similarity [12] .

            "text": "Besides the structural similarity, previous studies have suggested that MERS-CoV PL pro is also a multifunctional enzyme with protease, deubiquitinating and interferon antagonist activities [10] . MERS-CoV PL pro has a catalytic triad which is able to recognize and cleave at LXGG consensus cleavage sites; however, the detail enzyme kinetic mechanism is not known. Here we used the peptidyl substrate, Dabcyl-FRLKGGAPIKGV-Edans, to measure the proteolytic activity of MERS-CoV PL pro ( Figure 5A and Table 2 ). Interestingly, compared with that of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV PL pro is less active, with a 22fold loss in k cat /K m , as a result of a 27.5-fold loss in k cat and 1.3-fold loss in K m . According to the sequence alignment and homology modeling, most important residues for the catalysis, including the catalytic triad, Cys110-His277-Asp292 and the residues for substrate P4-P1 binding, Asp164, Pro249, and Gly276 (Asp165, Pro249, and Gly272 in SARS-CoV PL pro ) are highly conserved ( Figure 6 ) [10, 12] . Previous studies have confirmed that Y265F mutant of SARS-CoV PL pro still maintained comparable proteolytic activity with the wild-type [12] . It indicates that the equivalent residue in MERS-CoV PL pro , Phe268, is able to make a hydrophobic contact with the substrate P4 residue (Ub-Leu73). Furthermore, although different to the residue Tyr269 of SARS-CoV PL pro , the equivalent residue Glu272 of MERS-CoV PL pro , whose carboxyl group can point toward outside the hydrophobic pocket, may not interfere the binding of substrate P4 residue ( Figure 6 ). By contrast, as a putative oxyanion bound residue (Tyr107 in SARS-CoV PL pro ) [15] , the equivalent residue Leu105 of MERS-CoV PL pro cannot provide any hydrogen bonding interaction with oxyanion ( Figure 6 ). It will disfavor the formation of tetrahedral intermediate. Otherwise, different to the Leu163 of SARS-CoV PL pro , the distinct circular structure of the equivalent residue Pro162 of MERS-CoV PL pro may be too short to hover above the active site for substrate binding and serve to enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalytic triad residue, Cys110 ( Figure 6 ).

The results conform to our prediction. However, in contrast, the P162L mutant has a 67-fold loss in k cat /K m , as a result of a 40-fold loss in k cat and 1.6-fold increase in K m ( Figure 5A and Table 2 ). It suggests the requirement of the Proline residue in this site, although the reason is still not known. Nevertheless, the significant activity recovery by L105W mutation confirms the essential role of this residue on coronaviral PL pro catalysis. Theoretically, PL pro with lower proteolytic activity may result in late maturation of viral nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 proteins; nonetheless, its influence on MERS-CoV remains unknown.",

Interestingly, in contrast with its rather low proteolytic activity, MERS-CoV PL pro shows comparable DUB activity to SARS-CoV PL pro (Table 2 and Figure 5B ). It suggests that the two PL pro may show similar binding ability to the Ub core domain (residue 1-72). However, it is inconsistent with our previous observation on the structure of SARS-CoV PL pro in complex with Ub [12] . As mimicking the equivalent residue of MERS-CoV PL pro , the arginine mutation of a key residue for Ub core domain binding, Glu168, can result in unstable binding of SARS-CoV PL pro and Ub and significant loss of DUB activity [12] . To verify this inconsistency, a structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with Ub is quite necessary. Structural characterization of type 1 and type 2 PL pro have revealed that there are four cysteine residues coordinating to a zinc ion within the fingertips region in the finger domain [25, 28] . Remove of zinc from SARS-CoV PL pro will cause the tertiary structure more unstable and lead to less active [19] . Based on sequence alignment, MERS-CoV PL pro also has four cysteine residues (Cys190, Cys193, Cys225 and Cys227) on the corresponding position. Here the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PL pro in various EDTA was examined to delineate the possible metal ion effect. The activity was 79% in 10 mM, and 72% left in 50 mM EDTA ( Figure 5B ). These results suggest the existence of endogenous metal ion, which is beneficial for its DUB activity. By the way, it has been clarified that exogenous zinc ion can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV PL pro with the IC 50 value of 1.3 \u03bcM [24, 29] . Here we also confirmed the potent inhibitory effect of zinc ion on MERS-CoV PL pro ( Figure 5B ); whereas the mechanism of this inhibition by zinc is not yet understood.",

The secondary, tertiary and quaternary structural studies concluded that MERS-CoV PL pro has a similar scaffold to other coronaviral PL pro , as a right-hand-like architecture consisting of palm, thumb and fingers domains. The result of functional assay indicated that MERS-CoV PL pro exhibits potent DUB activity but rather low proteolytic activity. A natural mutation, Leu105, is the major reason for this difference. The present study not only demonstrates the structural and functional characterization of MERS-CoV PL pro , but provides a foundation for further understanding the coronaviral PL pro family, which is an ideal antiviral target. Next, with pure protein and effective proteolytic activity assay, potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV PL pro can be high throughput screened and identified.",
