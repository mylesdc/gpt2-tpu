Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for .28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1-3) and 6 days (IQR 4-10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4-7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization .28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5-26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons.",

At 60 days of follow-up among 288 surviving patients who were not in the hospital, 14.7% of patients (95% CI: 10.7 to 19.3%) indicated that symptoms had not resolved. There are a few other studies for which comparable results were reported, some such as reports on surveillance systems did not have a follow-up period and reported on deaths during hospitalization. In a World Health Organization study, Van Kerkhove, et al. reported on surveillance from Ministries of Health or National Public Health Institutes of 19 countries or administrative regions that encompassed 70,000 laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalized patients during April 2009-January 1, 2010. There were 9,700 (13.9%) patients admitted to the ICU and 2,500 (3.6%) deaths [6] . Active surveillance for laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in ten U.S. states during April 2009-April 2010 found that 4% of 5238 hospitalized adults died during the hospitalization [12] . A review by Cheng using 18 published reports found that the case fatality proportion for hospitalized patients with laboratoryconfirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection varied by region (Asia, Europe, Oceania, South America and North America) and ranged from 1.6% (Asia) to 6.9% (North America) [13] . In FLU 003, the majority of deaths (27 of 32) occurred in the hospital where the patient was enrolled. The 60-day mortality we observed among patients who were enrolled in the ICU (27%) is similar to reports by Rice and Brun-Buisson [14, 15] . Rice reported a 60-day mortality of 23% for 683 patients with confirmed or probable A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection who were enrolled in ICUs in the United States. Brun-Buisson reported a study of 208 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected patients in France with acute respiratory distress syndrome: 49 (24%) had died by 60 days following the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Kumar followed patients for 90 days and reported that among 168 critically ill patients (including 50 children) in Canada with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, 29 (17.3%) patients died, including 4 children; 18 (10.7%) patients died within 14 days and 24 (14.3%) died within 28 days of critical illness onset [16] . The ANZIC Influenza Investigators reported on 722 patients with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 admitted to an ICU in Australia and New Zealand during June through August, 2009. The median duration of ICU stay was 7 days and 16.9% patients died in the hospital [17] .",

The median age of outpatients and inpatients in our two cohorts were 30 and Table 5 . Baseline characteristics associated with disease severity at entry: FLU002 versus FLU003. 48 years, respectively. For both cohorts, the median age significantly increased after the first year. This is consistent with other reports [24, 25] . Our data suggest that morbidity and mortality during the initial season of enrollment was greater than in subsequent calendar periods after adjustment for the age difference. Consistent with this, using surveillance systems in Canada, Helferty reported a decline in admissions in the second wave of the epidemic [24] . Interestingly, a study from Spain, reported by Martin-Loeches, found a higher mortality during the post-pandemic period compared to the pandemic period; however, their analysis did not take into account the older age of patients in the postpandemic period [25] .",

For example, hospitalized patients were more likely to have greater BMI than outpatients; however, BMI was not associated with a risk of progression in the cohort analyses. The finding from the cross-sectional analyses may reflect the population of people that are hospitalized rather than be predictors of severe influenza. Similarly, women of child-bearing age who were pregnant were more likely to be enrolled in FLU 003 and were more likely to be hospitalized if enrolled in FLU 002. These data may reflect a reduced threshold for hospitalizing pregnant women with influenza infection because of concern about the development of disease progression. Similar findings were noted for patients with asthma or COPD. Cross-sectional differences and the apparent different associations with progression in FLU 002 and FLU 003 likely reflect a propensity for hospitalizing patients with these conditions when they develop ILI.",

This delay in enrollment for those with severe disease is relevant for the study of new treatments as was pointed out in a recent clinical trial in Southeast Asia [39] .

Bacterial pneumonia was a complication found in 29% of FLU 003 participants at enrollment. Patients with influenza are thought to be at higher risk for secondary bacterial infection and pneumonia because of the cytopathic effects of viral replication in cells as well as dysregulated changes in host cytokine production that may diminish both the ability of the immune system to clear bacteria and to achieve appropriate modulation of the inflammatory cascade [40, 41] . We assessed the prevalence of viral and bacterial co-pathogens in a sample of 333 patients and did not find any significant differences in prevalence or outcomes between FLU 002 and FLU 003 patients. In a cross-sectional study of 199 patients from Argentina with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, upper respiratory swabs were tested for a variety of bacterial and viral potential pathogens. In that study S. pneumoniae was associated with increased disease severity (it was detected among 25.0% of patients seen at ambulatory clinics and 56.4% of patients who were hospitalized or died) [42] . Approximately 66% of patients reported taking neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) in the 14 days prior to enrollment. Of those taking antivirals, less than half started these medications within three days of illness onset. A recent meta-analysis of hospitalized patients found a decreased mortality associated with early treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) versus late treatment or no treatment [43] . The authors of this meta-analysis point out that sicker patients are more likely to receive antivirals and patients with milder disease may not be treated, highlighting potential confounders and limitations of observational studies.",

A recent meta-analysis aimed at evaluating risk factors for severe outcomes in seasonal and pandemic influenza found that the lack of power is an issue for many studies [45] . At least a theoretical limitation is that there may be possible misclassification in FLU 003 because of potentially false positive RT-PCR results, particularly those with a positive local laboratory result and a negative central laboratory result. However, the false positive rate with commercial RT-PCR assays is generally quite low. Rather, because some of these individuals who had a positive local RT-PCR were enrolled more than ten days after the onset of symptoms, a time at which they may no longer be shedding influenza virus, the potential for misclassification would have been greater if they had been excluded.",

Most (75%) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in FLU 002 were enrolled between October 2009 and September 2010 (Table 1) due to the declining prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus after 2010.
