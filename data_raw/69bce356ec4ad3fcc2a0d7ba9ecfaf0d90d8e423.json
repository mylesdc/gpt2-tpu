            "text": "Most biological processes are described as a series of interactions between proteins and other molecules, and interactions are in turn described in terms of atomic structures. To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated with each subunit, we defined composite motifs that represent context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites. By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that meta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than sequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic structures to higher-order biological phenomena by classification and integration of binding site structures.",

Accordingly, most proteins, if not all, synchronously or asynchronously interact with multiple molecules ranging from single atom ions, small (non-polymer) molecules to proteins, nucleic acids and other macromolecules. The types and combinations of interactions in proteins are known to modulate their functions. For example, depending on their ligand-bound or ligand-free forms as well as interactions with corepressor or coactivator proteins, nuclear receptors can perform intricate transcriptional regulations [1] . The activity of coronavirus 3Clike proteases is controlled by dimerization through their Cterminal domain which is absent from picornavirus 3C proteases [2] . Furthermore, certain homologous proteins can catalyze completely different enzymatic reactions, namely transferase or hydrolase activities, by adopting different oligomerization states [3] . Therefore, it is important to identify not only individual interactions, but also possible combinations of the interactions that can be accommodated by a protein to fully describe its molecular functions as well as to distinguish different functions among homologous proteins.",

To date, the most widely used approach for protein function prediction is the annotation transfer, which is based on the assumption that protein functions are similar if their sequences are similar [4] [5] [6] . It has been gradually recognized, however, that such annotation transfer approaches may be unreliable in many cases [7, 8] . It has also been shown that function similarity is not a simple function of sequence similarity [9] . These observations prompt us to have more detailed examination of the determinants of protein functions.",

Thanks to the structural genomics efforts [11, 12] , we now have a great wealth of structural information available for close examination of sequence-structurefunction relationships of proteins. However, when global topologies or folds of protein structures are considered, it is often even more difficult to assign a specific function to a particular fold, for some folds include an extremely diverse set of proteins with diverse functions [3, 13] . The use of structural information is not limited to finding global fold similarity and distant evolutionary relationship. In particular, physical interactions between protein molecules and their ligands observed in experimentally solved protein structures allow more direct approaches to elucidate the relationship between protein structures and functions [14, 15] . To date, there have been many methods for detecting potential ligand binding sites based on structural similarity of proteins [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Most of these methods are targeted at predicting protein functions at the level of ligand binding and catalytic activity. There have also been many studies on protein-protein interaction interfaces to understand biological functions of proteins in cellular contexts [15, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . However, apart from a few works [35] [36] [37] , most of these studies are focused on particular types of interactions per se and do not explicitly address how the combination of interactions with small molecules and macromolecules modulates biological function of proteins.",

We then defined composite motifs by integrating the elementary motifs associated with individual subunits. In other words, protein subunits with the same combination of elementary motifs are said to share an identical composite motif. We then examined how such composite motifs correlated with protein functions as defined by the UniProt database [39] . It is demonstrated that the similarity between composite motifs better corresponds with the similarity between functions compared to the similarity between protein sequences or between individual binding sites. Finally, by integrating all the composite motifs associated with particular functions, we define meta-composite motifs. It is shown that meta-composite motifs are useful to elucidate the rich internal structures of biological processes compared to sets of homologous sequence clusters.",

(We did not use in the following analyses small clusters with less than 10 members because some small clusters exhibited spurious similarities.) We refer to these clusters as elementary motifs in the following. An elementary motif can be regarded as a bundle of mutually similar atomic dispositions of binding sites (Fig. 1A) . It should be noted that the elementary motifs are solely based on the binding site structures, and they do not directly include the identity of the binding partners. We have previously performed comprehensive analyses of elementary motifs [14, 15] . It was found that most elementary motifs were confined within homologous families. In some exceptional cases, motifs were shared across non-homologous families with different folds, which included motifs for metal, mononucleotide or dinucleotide binding for non-polymer binding sites [14] and coiled-coil motifs for protein binding sites [15] .",

In these structures, they share the same elementary motif for protease inhibitors at the catalytic sites in addition to similar calcium ion binding sites although the latter do not belong to the same elementary motif (Fig. 4C ). Factor VII heavy chain is in complex with its light chain counter part as well as with tissue factor, which shapes its functional form. On the other hand, b-trypsin is not known to form a similar complex structure. Thus, the difference in their complex structures can be associated with the difference in their functions: digestion for b-trypsin and blood coagulation for Factor VII.",

In this sense, composite motifs only represent snapshots of biological processes. To have a more integrative view of biological processes, we define meta-composite motifs by grouping all the composite motifs associated with particular functions (Fig. 5A,B) . For 3,359 UniProt functions, 2,760 meta-composite motifs were identified. The number of composite motifs associated with metacomposite motifs ranged from 1 to 157, with the average of 2.39 (S.D 4.62). While the same UniProt function implies the same metacomposite motif by definition, the converse does not hold in general as there are more functions than meta-composite motifs. Metacomposite motifs thus allow us to understand protein functions as an ensemble of snapshots of ligand-bound states of proteins. For comparison, we analogously defined meta-sequence motifs by associating each function with corresponding sequence clusters (complete linkage). We defined two types of sequence clusters, the one (type-1 sequence cluster) is based solely on BLAST E-value cutoff of 0.05, the other (type-2 sequence cluster) is based on sequence identity cutoff of 100%. Thus, the former sequence clusters include a wide range of homologous sequences while the latter include only (almost) identical sequences.",

For example, we can identify a meta-composite motif for the UniProt keyword ''Transcription'' (Fig. 6A) , and subsequently connect the constituent composite motifs (nodes) based on relations such as common elementary motifs or common sequences. When a protein in one composite motif interacts with another protein in another (possibly the same) composite motif, an edge representing protein-protein interaction can be also drawn. In the case of composite motifs, nodes may be also characterized according to their constituent elementary motifs (i.e., interaction states). We can observe a variety of interaction states of nodes and relations between nodes. If two nodes share identical sequences, it reflects a transition between different interaction states, possibly changing their atomic structures. For example, there are PDB entries of human cellular tumor antigen p53 with or without bound DNA (e.g., PDB 1UOL [58] and 2AC0 [59] ) which share the same elementary motif for zinc binding but have different composite motifs depending on the presence or absence of the elementary motif for DNA binding. Similarly, there are PDB entries of yeast RNA polymerase II with or without bound DNA/RNA in which the subunit RPB2 (e.g., PDB 1I3Q [60] , chain B and 1Y1W [61] , chain B) share some elementary motifs for protein binding, but other corresponding protein binding sites belong to different elementary motifs due to slight conformational changes (not shown), and an elementary motif for binding DNA is present in only one of the entries; thus these subunits identical in amino acid sequence have different composite motifs which are connected by edges of the common protein binding motifs and of the common sequence. Such description is not possible with meta-sequence motifs (Fig. 6B ) because sequence similarity alone cannot discriminate different interaction states.",

On average (Fig. 7A) , meta-composite motifs include more nodes (i.e., composite motifs), more connected components, as well as more connections between nodes representing common sequences (identified by the UniProt accession) and protein-protein interactions, compared to both type-1 and type-2 meta-sequence motifs. In particular, the increased number of edges representing common sequences indicates that many identical proteins are split into different composite motifs. The same trend is also observed for a particular meta-composite motif obtained for the keyword ''Transcription'' (Fig. 7B) . As expected, the type-1 meta-sequence motifs exhibit rather poor characteristics in most aspects because many homologs are grouped into large clusters so that differences in interaction states of proteins cannot be differentiated. While the type-2 meta-sequence motifs sometimes contain more edges for common elementary motifs, this is simply because many elementary motifs shared among homologous proteins are split into different sequence clusters irrespective of interaction states, which is reflected in the lower number of edges representing common sequences. Thus, the classification of proteins in terms of composite motifs allows us to inspect the organization of proteins involved in individual biological processes.",

As such, it is not necessarily suitable for analyzing specific functions of particular proteins [62] . In other words, the current protein structure classifications, for a good reason, ignore the differences among protein structures within the same families or folds. The examples shown in Figs. 1 and 4 clearly show that although those proteins share the same folds, they have varied functions. Such limitations of fold classifications with respect to specific assignment of protein functions have been known for some time [13] . Recently, seemingly minute differences within protein folds are being recognized as determinants of functional specificity as exemplified by the concept of ''embellishments'' proposed by Orengo and coworkers [63, 64] . Although it is often assumed that domains are the units of functions, there are inherent limitations in this assumption. For example, it has been known that the combination of domains generates new functions [65] , therefore it is questionable to assign one function to one domain. Furthermore, the very definition of domains is problematic as there exists no universally accepted definition of domains [66] .",

Nevertheless, it has been previously shown that thus identified elementary structural motifs are mostly confined within homologous protein families [14, 67] , especially for protein binding sites [15] . In this sense, the classification of binding site structures are effectively not very different from the traditional protein classifications. However, by combining the elementary motifs found in individual subunit structures solved under different experimental conditions, it becomes possible to specify a particular interaction state for a particular subunit. Thus, the classification of proteins based on composite motifs differs from the traditional classification schemes in that the notion of the composite motif allows us to explicate the universality of binding site structures and the diversity of their combinations at the same time. It should be stressed that the redundancy of the current PDB is essential for identifying elementary and composite motifs since the diversity of atomic structures is not negligible even for highly homologous or identical proteins [14, 68] .

A recent study also indicates that the integration of non-polymer and protein binding sites enhances the detection of functional specificity [37] . These results manifest the importance of the context-dependent combination of ligand binding motifs for understanding protein functions. The application of composite motifs to function prediction, however, requires some caveats. In case when we know a protein structure with bound ligands, we first need to identify the elementary motifs to which the binding sites belong. But it may not be always possible to identify all the necessary elementary motifs. In case when we only have a protein structure in its ligand-free form, it is necessary to predict its binding sites if any should exist. In this case, we need to rely on prediction based on prediction, which necessarily leads to low accuracy. While this limitation is inherent in any annotation transfer approaches, it is more stringent on the one based on composite motifs because it requires more interaction states to be solved for similar proteins. In any case, it is preferable to accumulate more structures in the PDB, not only those of completely novel folds, but also those of known folds but in new ligand-bound forms. It is worth noting that the function prediction by composite motif similarity is not based on supervised learning or parameter fitting so that the results obtained here should hold mostly valid for newly solved structures to the extent that the distribution of functionally characterized proteins in the PDB stays the same.",

These clusters are referred to as type-1 sequence clusters. In the other case, all pairs of sequences in a cluster must have 100% sequence identity as well as E-value of at most 0.05. This resulted in 4,594 clusters with at least 10 members, which are referred to as type-2 sequence clusters. When BLAST produces more than one alignment for a pair of sequences, the alignments were integrated into one alignment as long as they were mutually consistent.",

For composite motifs, a representative was randomly selected from each composite motif. For binding sites, a representative was randomly selected from each elementary motif. For protein sequences, a representative was randomly selected from each type-2 sequence cluster. Average function similarities for a given range of motif, binding site or sequence similarity (Fig. 3) were calculated for 10 sets of randomly selected representatives and the standard deviations of the average function similarity are shown as error bars.

Several binding sites belonging to each elementary motif are superimposed. The binding site atoms that constitute the elementary motif are shown in ball-and-stick representation with CPK coloring and ligands are shown in green wireframes (non-polymers) or tubes (proteins). These binding sites include subunits shown in C. Non-polymer ligands are phenylalanine and its analogs (N1), FAD (N2), and polyamines (N3). B: In this example, the combinations of 3 non-polymer binding elementary motifs (cyan triangles labeled N1, N2 and N3) and 3 protein binding elementary motif (orange rectangles labeled P1, P2 and P3) found in various protein subunits (black dots) define 3 distinct composite motifs (hexagons in magenta labeled C1, C2, and C3). Examples of each elementary motif are shown in molecular figures (A) right above the triangles or rectangles, and those of each composite motif are shown in molecular figures (C) right below the hexagons. Direct correspondence between elementary and composite motifs is indicated by thick edges in pale magenta. C: Concrete examples of composite motifs (corresponding to B). These 3 composite motifs share the same elementary motif for FAD binding (labeled N2 in B). Subunits (colored pink) containing the composite motifs (C1, C2, C3) are shown with elementary motifs in ball-andstick representations (protein binding sites in orange, non-polymer binding sites in cyan) and with ligands in green (spacefill for non-polymers, cartoon for proteins).
