            "text": "Background: Evidence points to the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease. In response, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority. To accomplish this, it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. Methods: In this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone. We then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. Results: Our results demonstrated that the generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus allows for single-cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the confirmed receptor for MERS-CoV. Consistent with the results from a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay, the antisera of mice vaccinated with a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 377-662) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG exhibited neutralizing antibody response against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Furthermore, one small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. Conclusion: Taken together, the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors, as well as evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV.",

Pseudovirus expressing VSV-G was included as the positive control. The target cells were respectively infected with MERS-CoV pseudovirus normalized for equal HIV-1 p24 content, and luciferase activity was measured at 72 h after infection. As shown Figure 1 , almost all tested human cells and a variety of animal cells could be infected by the produced pseudovirus. Particularly, MERS-CoV pseudovirus infected HT-1080 and SARS receptor-expressing ACE2-293T cells, maintaining a high infective ability in identified MERS-CoV receptor DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. In addition, human cell types, such as Hep-2, HEP-G2, A549 and MT-2, and animal cell types, including FRhK-4, MDCK, Vero, Vero E6 and NBL-7, were infected by MERS-CoV pseudovirus to a significantly higher degree than other cell types, such as PK15, Caco-2 and HeLa. However, no high infectivity was observed in MA-104. Our results also demonstrated that VSV-G positive control could highly infect almost all tested cell types, possibly due to the broad host range of VSV-G in the capability of infecting multiple tissues in various hosts, while Env-pseudovirus negative control was unable to infect tested cell lines [10] ( Figure 1 ). Next, we performed Western blot to identify the incorporation of MERS-CoV S in the packaged MERS-CoV pseudovirus. As shown in Figure 2A , clear bands corresponding to the HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein were identified in the generated pseudovirus of MERS-CoV by using antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein, respectively, while there was only p24, but no MERS-CoV S antigen, was detected in the VSV-G pseudovirus containing p24. These data suggest that specific S protein of MERS-CoV was effectively incorporated into the packaged HIV-1 particle, generating MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Western blot was also carried out to detect the expression of DPP4 in cells susceptible to pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Among the tested cells, PK-15 exhibited the highest expression of DPP4, followed by Huh-7. While DPP4 was expressed in FRhK4, HEP-G2, Caco-2, Vero, Vero MERS-CoV pseudovirus inhibition assay reliably detected the neutralizing activity of vaccinated animal sera, and the result was consistent with that of live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay",

As shown in Figure 3A , three tested representative mouse sera demonstrated neutralizing activity (>96%) against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in the DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells at titers of 1:160, while the control sera from mice immunized with PBS showed no neutralizing activity against tested pseudovirus. The above sera were further evaluated for neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection using a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay. The results indicated that neutralizing antibodies of these sera (test sera 1-3 and control sera 1-3) corresponded to those tested by pseudovirus inhibition assay ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that the established pseudovirus-based inhibition assay is sufficiently reliable to evaluate neutralizing antibodies induced by candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV.",

As shown in Figure 4A , a small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) [12, 13] and the 3hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) targeting HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 receptor, CD4 [14] could inhibit >90% and >68% of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at the concentration of 20 and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively, when tested in NBL-7 cells. However, the highly potent peptidic HIV entry inhibitors, C34 and T20 [15] , showed moderate inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at 2.5 and 20 \u03bcM. To further confirm our results, we detected the inhibitory ability of HP-HSA and ADS-J1 compounds as well as C34 and T20 peptides in the DPP4-expressing cell line Huh-7 [8] . Interestingly, the results were similar to those for the same compounds tested in NBL-7 cells, with around 90% of MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry inhibition at concentrations of 20 \u03bcM ( Figure 4B ). These two compounds, which carry net negative charges, may interact with the positively charge residues in the spike protein of the pseudotyped MERS-CoV, in a similar way as they inhibited infection of HIV [12] [13] [14] and other enveloped viruses, such as inhibition of SARS-CoV infection by ADS-J1 [16] and inhibition of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection by HP-HSA [17] . However, C34 and T20 peptides at 20 \u03bcM did not show any inhibitory activity in Huh-7 ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that these peptides are unable to inhibit MERS-COV pseudovirus entry into the DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells.",

As shown in Figure 4C , HP-HSA had no significant cytotoxicity at the concentration as high as 100 \u03bcM. ADS-J1 exhibited some cytotoxicity to Huh-7 cells with CC 50 (the concentration causing 50% cytotoxicity) of 26.9 \u03bcM. However, its IC 50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection) is 0.6 \u03bcM and its selective index (CC 50 /IC 50 ) is about 45. These data indicated that the decreased infectivity of the peudotyped MERS-CoV in the presence of these compounds is not due to their cytotoxicity, but is associated with their inhibition on MERS-CoV entry. These results confirmed that the established pseudovirus inhibition assay could be used as an effective way to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors.",

In this study, we generated a pseudotyped MERS-CoV based on the viral surface S protein, and detected its infectivity in different cell types. Indeed, the generated pseudovirus was able to infect a variety of cell lines, including human and non-human cell types. Generally, its cell susceptibility was consistent with that of wildtype MERS-CoV reported previously [18] , being able to maintain high infectivity in DPP4-expressing cells, such as Huh-7, MDCK, Vero, Vero E6, FRhK4, HEP-G2, and A549, and incapable of infecting HeLa and MA-104 cells with no DPP4 expression. Its infectivity to DPP4-expressing PK-15 and Caco-2 cells was relatively lower than that of wildtype virus [18] . This is possibly because that pseudotyped MERS-CoV, which contains only viral S protein with ability of single-cycle infection but lacks the capability for multiple rounds of replication, might have lower infectivity than wildtype MERS-CoV that contains all viral proteins necessary for virus replication.",

Similar phenomena were observed by Pohlmann and the colleagues, showing that the lentiviral pseudotype had a lower infectivity in DPP4-expressing A549 and that 293T cells from different batches maintained variant infectivities [9] . Reports have shown that HEK cells with undetectable DPP4 had relatively higher infectivity to wildtype MERS-CoV [18] .

However, to carry out this type of inhibition assay, it is necessary to utilize biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities. Unfortunately, this strict condition is often inconvenient and cannot be accessed by many researchers. In contrast, our pseudovirus-based inhibition assay can be performed without the requirement of BSL-3 laboratories, considerably simplifying the detection of neutralizing antibodies, as this method does not involve live viruses and is, therefore, safe to carry out [10, 23] . Moreover, we demonstrated consistency of neutralization results between the live virus-based inhibition assay and the established pseudovirus-based inhibition assay. These neutralizing results are also consistent with those obtained from the experiments on antisera of mice immunized by another RBD fragment containing residues 358-588 of MERS-CoV S protein, as reported recently [24] . The above results suggest a viable alternative for the rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV natural infection and the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines when BSL-3 facilities are not available. Furthermore, in the absence of BSL-3 facilities, the pseudovirus-based inhibition assay provides a convenient and reliable way to rapidly screen compound-or peptide-based MERS-CoV entry inhibitors to test neutralizing antibodies. With easy production of pseudovirus, rapid read-out and detection of inhibition, this method is particularly suitable for handling a large variety of samples in a short period of time.",
