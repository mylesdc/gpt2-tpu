Only a few centers however, are equipped with the available resources and equipment to perform these tests. We describe our experience in HVMA reaching-out to many more peripheral and relatively remote areas. A portable computer with HVMA software, video camera and a microscope were used. Fourteen disperse pediatric centers were reached and a total of 203 subjects were tested within a relatively short time (Clinical Trial Registration: NCT 01070914 (registered February 6, 2010). Results: With an average time of 20 minutes per patient, the system enabled us to test approximately 10-15 subjects per day. A valid HVMA result was made in 148 subjects and helped in the diagnosis of PCD in many of the patients who were subsequently confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy and/or immunofluoresence and/ or genetics and/or nasal Nitric Oxide testing. The sensitivity of abnormal HVMA to accurately predict PCD was 90.2%. Discussion and conclusion: This is the first report of an out-reach system to record HVMA for improved diagnosis of PCD in remote regions that are not within reach of PCD centers and experts. It provides immediate preliminary results and instantaneous feedback to the physician, patient and his/her family members in these areas. Future studies to compare this system to conventional desk top systems are warranted.",

Respiratory ciliary motility dysfunction is a major feature of PCD and has been traditionally evaluated by simple light microscopy of ciliated epithelium cells. Although this approach may identify markedly diminished or absent beat frequency, ciliary beating may appear normal in some cases of PCD [1, 3] . Moreover, it has become apparent that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [4, 5] . Therefore, the use of conventional light microscopic assessment of ciliary motility is no longer recommended as a screening technique. With recent advances in High-speed imaging, High-speed Video-Microscopy analysis (HVMA) evaluating both ciliary beat pattern and frequency is now used as part of routine diagnostic testing of PCD [1, 4, 5] . With this method a camera is attached to a microscope and the brushing specimen are placed under the microscope, after which images are recorded and analyzed. Only a handful of laboratories are equipped with the available resources and specialized equipment to perform these tests. Highly centralized centers equipped with HVMA technologies have been developed [6] where patients are referred for diagnostic purposes.",

Thus, each subject underwent all of these 5 tests including an HVMA evaluation of his/her cilia. The nasal brushing material was first used for HVMA and the remaining was used for IF staining and EM. NO measurements were obtained according to established American Thoracic Society guidelines. A single manufacture unit (CLD 88 SP, Eco Physics Duernten, Switzerland) was used in all centers. Most of the NO tests were done by a single team of investigators (MP, DB) with the same unit. Some of the NO tests were done by the experienced technicians at local centers using identical standardized operating procedures (Single breath with breath hold). The average of three measurements was used for statistical analysis. In young children (usually less than 4 years) the tidal breath method was employed.",

The first author has been trained in nasal brushing by experienced investigators (HO, CW, MS) before the present study. To minimize pain, the brush was rinsed with an isotonic saline solution before being inserted in the inferior nasal meatus, using rotatory and linear movements. The brush was immediately removed and transferred into a tube containing 2-3 mL of cell culture medium (RPMI Medium 1640, Endotoxin tested, Cell culture tested, without L-Glutamine, without Sodium Bicarbonate. Biological Industries LTD., Beit Haemek, Israel). The tube was then shaken vigorously so that cells became detached from the brush. The brush was withdrawn from the tube and used to smear slides (for later IF analysis) while the last portion of the material on the brush was stored in a glutaraldehyde filled tube for later EM analysis.",

This is a 24 well plate where the wells were identified by lettered rows A through D and numbered columns 1 through 6. It allowed multiple fluid samples to be placed in the wells with no need to remove the plate from the microscope holder between patients.

Analysis of each video clip included quality of image (images with no epithelia cells and/or clips with only single cells were excluded from further analysis), and beating pattern. Reviewing all 8-10 images for each subject and taking into account all of these criteria, the HVMA results of each subject were then categorized into the following specific categories [8] : Normal or Probably Normal beating (regular forward and recovery strokes); Immotile cilia; Residual movement (almost immotile cilia with minimal movements); Stiff beating (due to reduced bending capacity/ amplitude); Abnormal circular beating; Hyperkinetic cilia; No video available; Cannot be assessed. The last category (cannot be assessed) included subjects with poor quality clips for different causes such as those with single (not within an epithelial strip) immotile ciliated cells, poor resolution due to cells entrapped in mucus or subjective inability to distinguish between cilia of dying or damaged cells (secondary dyskinesia) to dyskinesia or a-kinetic cilia in a vital cell (primary dyskinesia).

As there is no gold standard for PCD [9] it is very challenging to exclude PCD and to calculate specificity and/or negative predictive value of diagnostic tests. For example, even when PCD is defined by abnormal genetics, it is impossible to define \"non PCD\" (true negative, false positive) cases, as a subject who is negative for known PCD mutations can still harbor a new unrecognized PCD causing mutation.

However, a formal economic comparison with office based testing was beyond the scope of our study. As PCD is a rare disease, it is likely that the number of subjects requiring PCD diagnostic testing will decrease after most previously undiagnosed individuals have been identified. This is a welcome effect accompanying any introduction of standardized care in rare diseases. Another technical limitation of our study is that temperature is not controlled in the approach described. That means that, in general, the temperature is around 24\u00b0C due to the heat generated by the microscope. Some researchers believe it is important to perform HVMA at 37\u00b0C [14] . We do not consider it a major drawback as, in our experience, as well as that of others [15] , ciliary beat patterns do not significantly vary at different temperatures. Furthermore, lower temperature reduces beat frequency which in turn allows better visualization and capturing of very fast beat variants. [8] The \"lower\" (x400) magnification in our portable system may reduce resolution compared to other systems. However, as shown recently by our group, higher magnification markedly reduced depth of focus in the Z plane and limits ciliary motion interpretation (see video s20 in Ref. [8] ). The magnification used in the present portable system is identical to the stationary one used routinely in our Germany center [8] . Standardization of HVMA is crucial in both stationary and reach-out system and this will require more discussion and consensus [9] .",
