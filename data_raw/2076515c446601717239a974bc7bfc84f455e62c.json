In the present study, two genetic variants of the ST3GAL1 gene, which encodes the Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-receptor to which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus binds for entry into the host cell, were investigated in an admixed Brazilian population. First, the six exons encoding the ST3GAL1 gene were sequenced in 68 patients infected with strain A(H1N1)pdm09. In a second phase of the study, the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms identified in this sample were genotyped in a sample of 356 subjects from the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil with a diagnosis of pandemic influenza. Functional analysis of the polymorphisms was performed in silico and the influence of these variants on the severity of infection was evaluated. The results suggest that rs113350588 and rs1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function. In the study the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium in the population studied (D' = 0.65). The GC haplotype was associated with an increased risk of death in subjects with influenza (OR = 4.632, 95% CI = 2.10;1.21). The AT haplotype was associated with an increased risk of severe disease and death (OR = 1.993, 95% CI = 1.09;3.61 and OR 4.476, 95% CI = 2.37;8.44, respectively). This study demonstrated for the first time the association of ST3GAL1 gene haplotypes on the risk of more severe disease and death in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.",

In contrast to other human viruses, the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus showed strong tropism for the two types of receptors during the 2009 pandemic [5, 6] . This feature may explain the pandemic potential acquired by this virus, since it permitted the virus of swine origin to bind to Sia\u03b12-6Gal (NAC) receptors of the upper respiratory tract, facilitating interpersonal transmission. On the other hand, maintenance of the capacity to bind to Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-permitted the virus to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, a fact explaining more severe cases of influenza such as severe viral pneumonias observed even in young adults without comorbidities [3, 4, 6] .",

The frequency of pregnancy, smoking, obesity, lung disease, heart disease, nephropathy or hemoglobinopathies did not differ significantly between groups.

The polymorphisms rs113350588 located in exon four and rs1048479 located in exon eight result in synonymous substitutions of an aspartate (D) at position 95 and of a serine (S) at position 273 of the protein, respectively. In silico functional analysis suggests that both variants may have putative direct and indirect effect on gene regulation (Table A in S1 File). Splicing analyses suggested that both SNPs may alter splicing of the transcript and consequently the isoforms of the protein. The substitution of guanine (G) for adenine (A) in rs113350588 promotes a change in an exonic splicing enhancer site (disrupting the sites for SF2/ASF proteins interactions), while the substitution of cytosine (C) for thymine (T) in rs1048479 activates a cryptic acceptor site, with the presence of one or more cryptic branch points. These polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.65) in the population studied, resulting in four haplotype alleles that form nine observable genotypes (diplotypes) (Tables B and C in S1 File). Moreover, analyses conducted with HaploReg 3.0 showed that rs1048479 is in linkage disequilibrium with two other polymorphisms (rs2142306 and rs276865) in all populations deposited in 1000 Genomes pilot project. These SNPs are placed in non-coding putative regulatory region (3'UTR and intronic regions respectively). Functional characterization of these SNPs can be seen in Table A in S1 File. The results suggest that these polymorphisms are placed in regulatory regions (TF binding sites as well as in sites of histone enhancer sites marks in several tissues), and alleles present different affinity for protein-DNA interaction (i.e. alternate C allele in both polymorphisms reduce the predicted affinity with proteins RXRA, SETDB1, Znf143, Myb when compared to wild allele T). The profile expression of interactive proteins (RXRA, SETDB1, Znf143, Myb) was evaluated in The Human Protein Atlas [11] . All the proteins showed a high expression level on the respiratory tissue, except Myb transcription factor, which presents a medium expression level. Taken together, our results suggest that rs113350588 and rs1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function.",

Multivariate analysis demonstrated an association between the GC and AT haplotypes and severity or death due to the infection. Expression levels of sialyltransferase genes are known to differ according to tissue and type of cell, permitting regulation of the cellular pattern of sialylation and anticipating a complex specificity of these enzymes [17] . The enzyme encoded by ST3GAL4 gene which transfers the sialic acid chain to a galactose residue, forming beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc), serves as a cell entry receptor of influenza H5N1. The expression patterns of this enzyme differ between tissues of the respiratory tract and also show interpersonal variability, influencing differences in the rate of infection with this virus in a population [18] . Similarly, higher expression of the Sia\u03b12-6Gal(NAC) receptor was observed in the lung tissue of a young patient without comorbidities who died, when compared to three other patients who died and had important risk factors for severe infection with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [19] . Variability in the expression of the Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-receptor in tissues of the respiratory tract may also be related to variations in the manifestation of influenza caused by the 2009 pandemic strain. The rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms of the ST3GAL1 gene were predicted to play a role in the regulation and processing of transcription of this gene, influencing the availability of functional protein in the cell. The GC and AT haplotypes of the ST3GAL1 gene were more frequent in patients who died and determines a higher risk to this outcome. The presence of these haplotype variants should influence the expression or structure of Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-receptors in cells of the lower respiratory tract, facilitating entry of the virus into tissues and increasing viremia which, in turn, can lead to more severe presentation of the disease and can culminate in death. Functional studies would clarify the influence of these variants on enzyme expression and receptor formation.",

Fisher's exact test was also applied to analyze differences in allele frequencies of the haplotypes between the groups of patients. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between ST3GAL1 gene haplotypes and the severity of infection, adjusting for the following variables: age, European and African genetic ancestry and presence of comorbidities. All analyses were performed with the SPSS 18.0 software and a level of significance of p < 0.05 was adopted.",
