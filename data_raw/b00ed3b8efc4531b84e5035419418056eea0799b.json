It does not, however, apply, to personal information used solely for personal reasons, household activities, public security, national defence or criminal law enforcement, and falls short when dealing with issues around communication. Two years later, the EU adopted Directive 97/66/EC for protecting privacy and confidentiality in telecommunications [13] . As technology and the web became increasingly ubiquitous, this directive quickly became limited in scope.

            "text": "In the UK, the Data Protection Act was first enacted on July 12, 1984 , thereby preceding the Directive on Data Protection adopted by the European Union (EU) by more than a decade. Upon adoption of the EU directive, however, the Act was amended in 1998. Though simpler than Canadian legislation in the sense that it applies to both public and private entities, it is none-the-less a complex document. In 2003, Lord Phillips of the Supreme Court of Judicature, Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in the UK referred to it as \"\u2026a cumbersome and inelegant piece of legislation\" [17] . Other UK health-related Acts have been amended to reference the Data Protection Act 1998, including the Access to Health Records Act 1990, the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988 and the Access to Personal Files and Medical Reports (Northern Ireland). The UK also has a Health and Social Care Act 2008 [18] , which replaced its 2001 predecessor and legislated the creation of a Care Quality Commission for the protection and promotion of the health, safety and welfare of the public. The Act makes it an offence to recklessly disclose confidential personal information obtained by the Commission that \"relates to and identifies an individual.\" (S. 76) Scotland has a Freedom of Information Act 2002, but a search on the UK Office of Public Sector Information website [19] yielded no specific data protection legislation for either Scotland or Northern Ireland. Scotland also has a Public Health Act enacted just last year, in 2008 [20] , which obligates Scottish Ministers, health boards and local authorities to protect public health. It allows for the disclosure of information to facilitate its directives despite any other legal prohibition or restriction, except, interestingly, the Data Protection Act 1998 (S. 117 (6)). Northern Ireland's Health and Social Care (Reform) Act 2009 [21] has a similar clause (S. 13 (8)).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that privacy in the United States, Canada and the European Union have their bases in slightly different philosophical constructs: in the United States, privacy is anchored in protection from the government; in Canada, in principles of autonomy and control; and in the European Union, the focus is more on dignity and public image [28] . The argument is made that the Canadian model offers the appropriate \"middle-ground\"after all, if individuals truly do have control over their own personal information, then they can choose to protect it from the government and others, and their dignity as far as public image is concerned is in their own hands. If we accept this definition of privacythat is, having control over one's own personal informationthen one might ask whether de-identification really solves the issue. Perhaps what is really needed is public health specific clarification in the legislation, public and practitioner education, and clear and concise frameworks and guidelines.",

Unfortunately, the relationship typically tends to be unidirectional. Just as privacy is a multifaceted and complex concept, so too is the required collaboration resulting from the interdependency of public health and legislation. And yet, the legal profession has not fully recognised the interdependence of the two fields [29] . While the privacy debate in public health may be fuelled in part by misperceptions of public health practitioners, it is very much coupled with a lack of understanding of the requirements of public health by legal practitioners. \"Privacy laws are most burdensome and least effective when they apply broadly, without proper concern for the settings in which they operate, the types of information that they cover, the obligations that they impose and the purposes they were designed to serve\" [30] . The issue can only be truly addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration. Until that happens, and until we recognise the importance and value of public health research and its implications on the health of individuals, we will continue to grapple with alternate de-identification solutions and sub-optimal data.
