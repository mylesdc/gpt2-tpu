Detailed studies of glial cell tropism of MHV are presented, demonstrating that direct MHV infection of oligodendrocytes differs between demyelinating (RSA59) and non-demyelinating (RSMHV2) viral strains both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that direct injury of mature oligodendrocytes is an important mechanism of virus-induced demyelination. In vivo, RSA59 infection was identified in spinal cord gray and white matter, but infected oligodendrocytes were restricted to white matter. In contrast, RSMHV2 infection was restricted to gray matter neurons and was not localized to oligodendrocytes. In vitro, RSA59 can infect both oligodendrocyte precursors and differentiated oligodendrocytes, whereas RSMHV2 can infect oligodendrocyte precursors but not differentiated oligodendrocytes. Viral spreading through axonal means to white matter and release of the demyelinating strain MHV at the nerve end is critical for oligodendrocytes infection and subsequent demyelination. Understanding the mechanisms by which known viruses effect demyelination in this animal model has important therapeutic implications in the treatment of human demyelinating disease.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, or relapsing and remitting demyelinating disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) specifically. In addition to demyelination, there is partial loss of oligodendroglial cells and axonal degeneration predominately within white matter, although some demyelination in MS also involves gray matter (Sharma et al., 2001; Bo et al., 2003; Vercellino et al., 2005; Lassmann et al., 2007; Rudick and Trapp, 2009 ). The mechanism of demyelination in MS is unknown, but may involve a T cell response triggered by virus infection (Allen and Brankin, 1993; Hern\u00e1n et al., 2001; Hemmer et al., 2002) . Despite numerous attempts to identify an etiologic agent, a specific virus has not been recognized. Various animal models have been developed to study MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Kornek et al., 2000) as well as viral-induced CNS demyelinating disease models. One particularly useful mouse model utilizes MHV-induced demyelination that mimics the pathology of MS (Das Sarma, 2010) .",

Both strains are capable of causing hepatitis, encephalitis, and meningitis, however, the two strains differ in their ability to induce subsequent demyelination and axonal loss (Das Sarma et al., 2009) . Seven days post-infection, RSA59 produces demyelination that is best observed in the spinal cord. In contrast, RSMHV2 does not produce demyelination and only rarely demonstrates axonopathic changes in spinal cord white matter (Das Sarma et al., 2009) . The inability of RSMHV2 to induce demyelination is due in part to a lack of transport of viral antigen (and the subsequent inflammatory reaction) to the white matter. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate deficits in the ability of RSMHV2 to spread between neurons when compared to inter-neuronal spread by RSA59 (Das Sarma et al., 2009 ). RSA59-induced demyelination occurs in the setting of both axonal degeneration as well as macrophage mediated myelin stripping along intact axons (Das Sarma et al., 2009) . While spike glycoprotein mediates spread of viral antigen to white matter through axonal transport, specific mechanisms leading to subsequent demyelination are not known. Viral antigen in white matter axons may be sufficient to trigger an inflammatory response that damages myelin. Alternatively, viral antigen may need to spread directly into oligodendrocytes, or indirectly to oligodendrocytes via astrocytes, using the spike protein.",

RSA59 or its parental demyelinating strain MHV-A59 can infect oligodendrocytes in vitro, isolated from either rat or mouse, or in oligodendrocyte cell lines (Liu et al., 2006 (Liu et al., , 2011 Li et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, the inability of the RSMHV2 strain to induce demyelination has not been resolved and may be due to an inability to selectively destroy/impair oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord white matter. Alternatively, the failure of RSMHV2 to effect demyelination may be related to impaired axonal transport as has already been observed (Das Sarma et al., 2009 ). In the current study, viral tropism of RSA59 and RSMHV2 in spinal cord oligodendrocytes, myelin, neurons, and astrocytes is compared in order to further clarify the mechanism(s) of viral-mediated demyelination.",

Following viral infection, axonal damage can occur concurrently with and independently of demyelination and direct viral-mediated axonal damage can occur as a primary pathology, separate from demyelination. Despite the fact that both strains can infect neurons, there is impaired inter-neuronal spread of the RSMHV2 strain in vivo and in vitro as well as a lack of translocation from gray matter to white matter (Das Sarma et al., 2009) in the spinal cord. Strain specific viral dissemination and selective replication in CNS cells are also critical for MHV induced neuropathology.

The two very distinct and different doses of viruses used are based on 50% of the LD50, where previously it has been demonstrated that both strains replicate at a similar rate in the brain and spinal cord and viral titers at day 5 and day 7 post-infection are almost the same (Das Sarma et al., 2000 Sarma et al., , 2009 . Moreover, even at 100 PFUs inoculation, RSA59 can cause demyelination although the number and size of demyelinating plaques formed was less compared to an inoculum of 20,000 PFUs (Das Sarma et al., 2000) .",

This differential viral tropism between the brain and spinal cord is likely due to the route by which virus gains access to the white matter. Mice are infected by transcranial inoculation, a traumatic disruption of the gray-white matter interface that permits viral particles direct access to myelin. From the myelin sheath, viral particles could then spread proximally to the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. In contrast, viral involvement of the spinal cord occurs nontraumatically. A major mechanism of viral spread to spinal cord white matter is through spike-mediated axonal transport (Das Sarma et al., 2009) , which may partly explain the inability of RSMHV2 viral antigen to enter oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate that even though RSMHV2 virus reaches spinal cord gray matter neurons and replicates , it does not spread to oligodendrocytes or myelin.

Brain neurons can be infected with both RSA59 and RSMHV2 following intracranial inoculation. Virions are likely unrestricted within neuronal cytoplasm and therefore able to diffuse or be actively transported through the axoplasm into spinal cord gray matter. From the axoplasm, only the RSA59 virus is then capable of spreading to spinal cord neurons and being transported anterogradely to the white matter, or of crossing into the myelin sheath and from there, into the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. The lack of co-localization with GFAP with either strain indicates that the spread of MHV infection in the spinal cord does not involve an indirect route to oligodendrocytes through astrocytes. The lack of viral infection in spinal cord astrocytes is unexpected since our previous work (Das clearly showed that both RSA59 and RSMHV2 could infect brain astrocytes in vivo. As described above, there was a similar discrepancy in the colocalization of EGFP in brain vs. spinal cord oligodendrocytes due to the different routes of infection (unpublished data). Traumatic transcranial inoculation likely provides viral access to astrocytes due to disruption of the pia and blood/brain barrier whereas no such disruption occurs in the spinal cord. Our results are similar to those seen with other viral strains; direct viral induced oligodendroglial dystrophy is a common etiology of JC virus induced demyelination (Weiner et al., 1972; Major et al., 1992) .",

Understanding the mechanisms by which known viruses effect demyelination in an animal model has important therapeutic implications in the treatment of human demyelinating disease. Our experimental system is a valuable tool in this regard and, more generally, in the elucidation of the mechanisms of how neurotropic viral infection can directly lead to oligodendrogliopathy in demyelination.",

Confluent oligodendrocyte precursor enriched cultures were maintained in oligodendrocyte differentiated medium for 7 days and infected with RSA59 or RSMHV2 at a M.O.I. of 1 for 24 h. Virus-infected cells were identified by EGFP (green). Differentiated oligodendrocytes were stained with anti-GalC antibody (marker for differentiated oligodendrocytes, red). Sister cultures of differentiated oligodendrocytes were either mock infected (A-C) or infected with RSA59 (D-F), or with RSMHV2 (G,H). In all three RSA59 infected cultures (D-F) syncytia formation is obvious and there are drastic reductions in the expression of GalC, but in RSMHV2 infected cultures, most of the infected cells were not oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that RSA59 can infect differentiated oligodendrocytes whereas RSMHV2 is unable to infect differentiated oligodendrocytes. Magnification (A-H: 600X). Thick arrows mark differentiated matured oligodendrocytes in (A-C). Thin arrows in (D-F) mark infected mature oligodrndrocytes which formed syncitia.
