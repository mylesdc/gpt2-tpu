            "text": "Electronic disease surveillance, particularly syndromic surveillance, holds promise to improve health security in resource-limited environments. [6, 7] Such systems have become versatile tools in health departments in the United States. [8] Epidemiologists using electronic disease surveillance not only have the potential to detect anomalous disease activity earlier than traditional laboratorybased surveillance, but they also have the ability to monitor the health of their community in the face of a known threat. [9, 10, 11] More than a decade ago, in collaboration with the US Department of Defense (DoD), the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) developed the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE). ESSENCE collects, processes, and analyzes non-traditional data sources (i.e. chief complaints from hospital emergency departments, school absentee data, poison control center calls, over-thecounter pharmaceutical sales, etc) to identify anomalous disease activity in a community. The data can be queried, analyzed, and visualized both temporally and spatially by the end user. [10] ESSENCE is currently being utilized by the US Department of Defense, US Veterans Health Administration, and numerous state and local health departments in the US. [11] The current SAGES initiative leverages the experience gained in the development of ESSENCE, and the analysis and visualization components of SAGES are built with the same features in mind. This paper will describe the key features and potential uses of the SAGES product in developing or resourcelimited settings.",

To this end, they have entered into a robust collaboration with the JHU/ APL to create SAGES. Cognizant of work underway on individual surveillance systems components, e.g., collection of data by cell phones, we have focused our efforts on the integration of inexpensive and/or freely available, interoperable software tools that facilitate regional public health collaborations. [12] SAGES tools are organized into four categories: 1) data collection, 2) analysis & visualization, 3) communications, and 4) modeling/simulation/evaluation. (Figure 1 ) Within each category, SAGES offers a variety of tools compatible with surveillance needs and different types or levels of information technology infrastructure. In addition to the flexibility of tool selection, there is flexibility in the sense that the analysis tools do not require a fixed database format. For example, rather than requiring an existing database to adapt to the tool, the SAGES database tools adapt to the format of all Java database compliant formats. Lastly, the SAGES tools are built in a modular nature, which allows for the user to select one or more tools to enhance an existing surveillance system or use the tools en masse for an end-to-end electronic disease surveillance capability. Thus, each locality can select tools from SAGES based upon their needs, capabilities, and existing systems to create a customized electronic disease surveillance system.",

The approach should allow customizable data collection, enable multiple data streams collected in different ways, and be scalable based upon needs. [6, 7] Data collection tools included within SAGES are web forms, short message service texting programs, digital logbooks, and interactive voice response systems. Data entered into SAGES can be validated by the stakeholder. Where appropriate, other collection methods such as email and secure file transfer protocol can be applied as well. The data acquisition methods in SAGES are readily adaptable to evolving standards in both minimum data sets for disease surveillance and routine diagnosis and care.",

EDE does not need access to the internet as it ingests data files stored on the same computer. The webbased tool, known as OpenESSENCE, is a multi-user network accessible data entry, analysis, and visualization tool that enables an epidemiologist to monitor the population's health from any computer connected to that network. Available analyses for both tools depend on the nature of the data ingestion, but may include demographic characterizations, temporal and spatial analyses, display of patient level information, geographic information system mapping, anomalous event detection, and dynamic query capability. (Figures 2, 3, 4) Communications. SAGES tools can facilitate compliance with 2005 IHR reporting requirements and allow the sharing of actionable information across jurisdictional boundaries. Sharing of patient-level data across regional boundaries is generally not realistic and often not helpful, as local public health entities are usually best suited to interpret local events. However, once these data have been transformed into meaningful information, it may be immensely valuable to share that information with other countries in the region. Dissemination of this type of information may aid in the interpretation of regional events and helps foster better, lasting public health collaborations. SAGES includes tools for two-way communication between public health officials and graphics that are exportable into common image formats. Each SAGES user controls the type and level of detail of all information shared with each recipient ('role-based access') and also whether the information sharing is manual or automated. [14] ( Figure 5 ) More importantly, the data are collected and stored only by the user, and remain under the sole control of the user at all times.",

The Peruvian system uses IVR technology for data collection. The phone calls needed for IVR are very expensive in the Philippines while SMS text messages cost very little. With that in mind, an existing paperbased fever surveillance system was modified to allow basic information (age, sex, clinic, and symptoms) on patients presenting with fever to be sent to the health department daily via SMS using a standardized texting protocol and abbreviations. The SMS messages are received by a cell phone attached to a computer located at the health department and routed through a simple data cleansing program that sequesters records with incorrect formatting and sends a standard text message to the sender asking them to resend the data. The correctly formatted messages are copied to a database that is then analyzed in EDE. Some clinics quickly adapted to the SMS protocol, while others have found it more difficult to send error-free messages. The percent error decreased over time ( Figure 6 ) suggesting that, with constructive help, most clinics were able to become proficient with the SMS protocol. As of January 2011, approximately 50% of eligible districts are sending daily fever information via text, and the data are being regularly reviewed in EDE. The remaining districts continue to send paper reports or report by phone. The primary reasons given for not using the SMS protocol were lack of personnel or discomfort sending SMS text messages. Focused, repeated training also helped some clinics get started.",

Assuring the smooth interoperability of all software components is sometimes difficult, as is balancing functionality with simplicity for sites with minimal infrastructure. Additionally, finding the appropriate person or group within a country to champion the implementation of a new surveillance system can be fraught with financial, political, territorial challenges. Finally, the open source nature of the software inherently has the consequence of a lack of control of modifications to the software after it is released, potentially leading to incompatible and unverified versions. Conversely, if these changes can be shared in a Wiki-like environment, the entire community using SAGES may benefit from novel improvements.",
