            "text": "New World bats have recently been discovered to harbor influenza A virus (FLUAV)-related viruses, termed bat-associated influenza A-like viruses (batFLUAV). The internal proteins of batFLUAV are functional in mammalian cells. In contrast, no biological functionality could be demonstrated for the surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HAL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NAL), and these proteins need to be replaced by their human counterparts to allow spread of batFLUAV in human cells. Here, we employed rhabdoviral vectors to study the role of HAL and NAL in viral entry. Vectors pseudotyped with batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL were able to enter bat cells but not cells from other mammalian species. Host cell entry was mediated by HAL and was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal low pH. In contrast, sialic acids were dispensable for HAL-driven entry. Finally, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was able to activate HAL for cell entry indicating that batFLUAV can utilize human proteases for HAL activation. Collectively, these results identify viral and cellular factors governing host cell entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. They suggest that the absence of a functional receptor precludes entry of batFLUAV into human cells while other prerequisites for entry, HAL activation and protonation, are met in target cells of human origin. and Molecular Biosciences, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) grants GSC 226/1 and GSC 226/2 (www.dfg.de).

HA facilitates viral attachment to cells by binding to sialic acids on cell surface proteins or lipids [9-11] and, upon proteolytic activation by a host cell protease and exposure to endosomal low pH, mediates fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane [12] [13] [14] . In contrast, NA promotes release of progeny particles from infected cells by removing sialic acids from cell surface factors. Based on sequence and antigenic properties, sixteen HA (H1-16) and nine NA (N1-9) subtypes have been identified, and viruses representing all HA and NA subtypes are circulating in waterfowl [4, 15] . However, FLUAV-related viruses were recently discovered in New World bats [16, 17] , provisionally termed bat-associated influenza A-like viruses (batFLUAV), and were shown to harbor HAand NA-like proteins (termed HAL and NAL), which constitute new subtypes, H17/H18 (HL17/HL18) and N10/N11 (NL10/NL11), respectively. The question whether these viruses have the potential to infect and spread in humans is the focus of current research efforts.",

We show that HAL facilitates entry into certain bat but not human cell lines and that entry is independent of sialic acids. In contrast, HAL-driven entry was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal acidification. Moreover, we provide evidence that HAL can utilize the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for its activation, suggesting that bat-FLUAV entry into human cells is mainly restricted at the stage of receptor engagement while proteolytic activation and triggering of HAL are not limiting the entry process.",

Cattaneo, via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. The pCAGGS-based expression plasmid for NAL of batFLUAV A/little yellowshouldered bat/Guatemala/153/2009 (H17/N10) (GenBank: CY103878.1, NAL10) was provided by M. Schwemmle. HAL equipped with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK, HAL17-FLAG and HAL18-FLAG) were constructed by PCR and controlled for sequence integrity by automated sequence analysis.

For experiments analyzing proteolytic activation of HAL17 and HAL18 by human type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), we employed expression plasmids for TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11E (DESC-1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL), which have been described previously [32, 33] .",

Propagation of VSV \u00c3 \u0394G-fLuc was performed in a previously described VSV-G-expressing, transgenic cell line [37] . Generation of VSV pseudotypes (VSVpp) was performed as follows: HEK-293T cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation with expression plasmids encoding  viral surface proteins, VSV-G (positive control) , NiV-F/G, FLUAV-HA and/or NA and bat-FLUAV-HAL and/or NAL, or empty plasmid (pCAGGS) as negative control.

In order to gain insights into the functional activity of batFLUAV-HAL and NAL, we employed rhabdoviral vectors pseudotyped with these proteins. We inoculated cell lines from different host species, including those standardly used for FLUAV research, as well as cell lines derived from different bat species (Table 1) , as they are the natural reservoir for batFLUAV. We chose bat cell lines known to be susceptible to infection by viruses of different families [28, 29, 31] and previously used to functionally characterize surface glycoproteins of bat-borne viruses [28, 36, 38] . It is well established that FLUAV-HA depends on proteolytic cleavage by host cell proteases to transit into an active form [12] and it has been previously reported that batFLUAV can be activated by exogenous trypsin [39] [40] [41] . Therefore, we assessed whether trypsin treatment of the pseudotypes impacts transduction efficiency. As controls, we included the surface glycoprotein(s) of well-characterized FLUAV strains, A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (WSN-HA, WSN-NA), A/South Carolina/1/18 We found that none of the human, simian and canine cell lines was susceptible to entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins (Fig 2A) . In contrast, pseudotypes bearing VSV-G, NiV-F/G or WSN-HA/NA could readily enter these cells, whereas pseudotypes that harbored 1918-or H2N2-HA/NA required activation by exogenous trypsin for efficient transduction (Fig 2A) . These results are in agreement with expectations, since activation of WSN-HA is known to be independent of trypsin [42] [43] [44] , although viral infectivity can be enhanced by trypsin treatment.",

CpKd cells remained refractory to entry mediated by 1918-HA/NA or H2N2-HA/NA but also showed the lowest susceptibility to all other tested pseudotypes. Notably, three bat cell lines (EidNi/41, HypNi/1.1 and EpoNi/22.1) were susceptible to entry of pseudotypes bearing HAL and NAL of batFLUAV (Fig 2B) , demonstrating that surface glycoproteins of batFLUAV can mediate cellular entry. Entry into the three bat cell lines was robust (1-3 log units above the threshold) and required prior treatment of pseudotypes with trypsin, which presumably resulted in the proteolytic activation of HAL. Furthermore, pseudotypes bearing HAL17/NAL10 or HAL18/NAL10 were both able to enter HypNi/ 1.1 and EpoNi/22.1 cells while EidNi/41 cells could only be transduced by pseudotypes bearing HAL18/NAL10 (Fig 2B) , suggesting that batFLUAV of the HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 subtype might exhibit subtle differences in entry efficiency or cell tropism. Finally, HAL-proteins with a C-terminal FLAG tag facilitated host cell entry, although with somewhat reduced efficiency as compared to their untagged counterparts, indicating that the proteins used to study HAL expression and virion incorporation (Fig 1) were functional (data not shown). Taken together, we showed that batFLUAV surface proteins can mediate entry into certain bat cell lines. For further studies on the entry process, we focused on EpoNi/22.1 cells since they showed the highest susceptibility to entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins.",

To study the impact of the batFLUAV-NAL on transduction efficiency, we produced pseudotypes bearing batFLUAV-HAL, -NAL or both proteins. For comparison, we generated pseudotypes harboring WSN-HA, WSN-NA or both proteins. These pseudotypes were then used for inoculation of MDCK (inoculated with pseudotypes bearing WSN proteins) and EpoNi/22.1 (inoculated with pseudotypes bearing WSN or batFLUAV proteins) cells. Pseudotypes harboring only WSN-NA were not able to transduce target cells (Fig 3) while pseudotypes bearing either WSN-HA alone or in combination with WSN-NA transduced both MDCK and EpoNi/22.1, as expected. Transduction efficiency was 500-1,500-fold higher when WSN-NA was expressed in cells used for pseudotype production, in keeping with the findings that the presence of NA is required for efficient release of HA-bearing vectors and infectious FLUAV [32, 45, 46] . Pseudotypes harboring NAL were not infectious while pseudotypes bearing HAL robustly transduced EpoNi/22.1 cells, indicating that batFLUAV-HAL, like WSN-HA, is sufficient to mediate host cell entry. However, unlike WSN-NA, the expression of NAL in pseudotype producer cells did not increase transduction efficiency of HAL-harboring pseudotypes (Fig 3) , suggesting that NAL is not required for release and/or infectivity of HAL containing particles, at least in the experimental system chosen.",

In order to assess the potential role of sialic acids in HALdriven entry, we pre-treated the cells with escalating doses of bacterial neuraminidase before transduction. Neuraminidase treatment of EpoNi/22.1 cells reduced transduction mediated by the FLUAV-HA proteins, as expected (Fig 4) . In contrast, sialidase treatment had no effect on pseudotype entry mediated by batFLUAV-HAL, NiV-F/G or VSV-G. Moreover, pre-treatment of EpoNi/22.1 cells at the highest dose (150 mU) even enhanced transduction driven by HAL and VSV-G (Fig 4) .

            "text": "FLUAV-HA is synthesized as an inactive precursor and requires activation by host cell proteases to be responsive to low pH, the trigger for HA-driven membrane fusion [12] [13] [14] . Members of the TTSP family activate FLUAV-HA in cell culture [33, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] and TMPRSS2 was previously shown to be essential for FLUAV-HA activation and viral spread in mice [59] . Therefore, we asked whether TTSPs able to activate FLUAV-HA can also activate batFLUAV-HAL. For this, we first investigated batFLUAV-HAL cleavage by TMPRSS2, DESC-1 and MSPL, and compared it to cleavage by trypsin. Cleavage of the 1918-HA served as positive control. We found that 1918-HA was efficiently processed by all proteases tested, as expected. Moreover, we could show that coexpression of TMPRSS2, DESC-1 and MSPL, and trypsin treatment resulted in cleavage of the HAL precursor (HAL 0 ) determined by the appearance of bands corresponding to the HAL 2 subunit (Fig 6A) . While HAL18 was comparably cleaved by all tested TTSPs, HAL17 cleavage by TMPRSS2 was more pronounced than proteolysis by DESC-1 and MSPL (Fig 6A) . Moreover, HAL18 was generally more sensitive to cleavage by TTSPs than HAL17 (Fig 6A) . In order to assess whether batFLUAV-HAL cleavage by TTSPs also leads to HAL activation for host cell entry, we produced pseudotypes harboring batFLUAV-HAL (HAL17 or HAL18) in the presence of TMPRSS2, DESC-1 and MSPL. As a control, pseudotypes bearing 1918-HA and -NA were included in this experiment. The pseudotypes were treated with trypsin to activate HA/HAL or were mock-treated before addition to EpoNi/22.1 cells. Pseudotypes bearing 1918-HA and -NA and produced in the presence of TMPRSS2, DESC-1 and MSPL or treated with trypsin robustly transduced target cells ( Fig  6B) . In contrast, infectivity of FLUAV-HA pseudotypes produced in the absence of TTSPs or not treated with trypsin was in the background range (Fig 6B) . Similarly, batFLUAV-HALbearing pseudotypes were activated by trypsin or TTSPs, including TMPRSS2 (Fig 6B) . However, differences in the activation of HAL17 and HAL18 were observed and correlated with the efficiency of HAL protein cleavage, as determined above (Fig 6A) . Thus, expression of TMPRSS2 but not DESC-1 and MSPL conferred robust infectivity to HAL17-bearing pseudotypes while all proteases were able to efficiently activate HAL18. Moreover, transfection of escalating amounts of TMPRSS2-encoding plasmids increased infectivity of HAL17-bearing pseudotypes in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transfection of even the lowest amount of TMPRSS2 plasmid was sufficient to confer maximal infectivity of HAL18bearing pseudotypes, confirming that the efficiency of TMPRSS2-mediated activation of HAL is subtype specific (Fig 6C) . In sum, proteolytic activation of batFLUAV-HAL is critical for HAL-driven cell entry and proteases able to activate HA can also activate HAL. Host Cell Entry by Bat-Associated Influenza Viruses",

Unraveling the zoonotic potential of batFLUAV is of great importance since FLUAV are major human pathogens, responsible for influenza epidemics and pandemics. While the batFLUAV replication machinery appears to be functional in different mammalian (including human) cells [16, [18] [19] [20] [21] 60] , reassortment with FLUAV and FLUBV is unlikely [18, 19] . Regarding batFLUAV tropism of the viral surface proteins, HAL and NAL, only Human proteases that activate FLUAV-HA for cell entry also activate batFLUAV-HAL. (A) HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA or HAL proteins and either trypsin treated or cotransfected with plasmids encoding type II transmembrane serine proteases. Transfection of empty vector served as negative control. Cleavage of HA/HAL proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, employing antibodies against FLUAV-HA (\u03b1-FLUAV) and the FLAG epitope (\u03b1-FLAG). Detection of \u00df-actin served as loading control. Signals corresponding to uncleaved precursor proteins are marked by black circles, while products of proteolytic cleavage are indicated by white circles. The results were confirmed in a separate experiment. To assess proteolytic activation of HA/HAL proteins, vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes (VSVpp) were produced in cells transfected to express the indicated type II transmembrane serine proteases (B) or different amounts of TMPRSS2 (C). Pseudotypes were either directly used for transduction of EpoNi/22.1 cells (black bars) or previously treated with trypsin (white bars). At 24 h post inoculation, transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of the activity of VSVpp-encoded luciferase in cell lysates. For normalization, transduction by HA-or HAL-bearing pseudotypes that were produced in the absence of type II transmembrane serine protease expression (empty vector) and not treated with trypsin was set as 1. The result of a single representative experiment carried out with quadruplicate samples is presented. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments carried out with separate pseudotype preparations. Error bars indicate standard deviations. A two-tailed, unpaired student's t-test was used to test statistical significance (* = p < 0.05).",

We show that HAL mediates entry into certain bat cell lines and that entry does not depend on the presence of sialic acids on the cell surface.

            "text": "We used a VSV-based vector system to study cellular entry of HAL and NAL-bearing particles. VSV pseudotypes allow convenient analysis of entry driven by diverse glycoproteins [28, 31, 61] , although one should keep in mind that due to differences in particle shape and efficiency of glycoprotein incorporation pseudotypes might not adequately mirror all aspects of cellular entry of authentic viruses [62, 63] . We found that cell lines frequently used for FLUAV propagation were not susceptible to transduction by HAL and NAL bearing particles, which is in agreement with the finding that replacement of batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL by their FLUAV counterparts is required for spread of batFLUAV in the cell lines studied so far [18, 19] . In contrast, inoculation of bat cell lines originating from five different species of micro-and megachiropteran bats revealed that three cell lines, EidNi/41, HypNi/1.1, EpoNi/22.1, were susceptible to entry mediated by batFLUAV surface proteins. EpoNi/22.1 cells showed the highest susceptibility and were thus used for further studies, while EidNi/41 cells were found to be robustly susceptible only to transduction by pseudotypes harboring the HAL18. Collectively, these findings suggest that batFLUAV surface proteins can mediate entry into certain bat cells and that entry efficiency might differ between batFLUAV subtypes. Our finding that certain bat cell lines are susceptible to pseudotypes harboring HAL of batFLUAV are in line with observations very recently documented by Maruyama et al. who found that out of a diverse panel of bat cell lines tested, cells from Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii and Pteropus giganteus were susceptible to pH-dependent, HAL-driven entry [64] . A cell line derived from Eidolon helvum spleen cells was found to be non-susceptible in contrast to our findings with a kidney cell line established from the same species, suggesting that receptor expression might differ between organs. Somewhat more surprising, Maruyama and colleagues also observed HAL-driven entry into MDCK cells [64] , which was not detected in the present study, and these discrepant results might be attributed to use of MDCK cells from different sources or to differences in the method used to quantify pseudotype entry. Finally, it is noteworthy that cell lines from bats inhabiting different geographical locations (Africa, Asia, Europe) were found to be susceptible to HAL-driven entry, suggesting that entry is not a bottleneck for spread of batFLUAV between bat species.",

We first focused on NAL. The expression of this protein, unlike expression of NA, in pseudotype-producing cells did not increase the titers of vectors harboring the corresponding bat-FLUAV-HAL protein. However, this finding does not exclude that NAL, like the NA of FLUAV, acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Thus, HEK-293T cells used for pseudotype preparation were not susceptible to HAL-driven entry, most likely because they do not express the appropriate receptor. It thus remains to be analyzed whether batFLUAV-NAL increases release of HAL-bearing vectors and authentic batFLUAV from susceptible bat cell lines. These endeavors might be challenging since transfection of bat cell lines by calcium-phosphate precipitation and liposome-based reagents was inefficient (not shown).",

In contrast to FLUAV-HA, however, HAL does not depend on the presence of sialic acids for entry. Thus, treatment of EpoNi/22.1 cells with sialidase did not decrease HAL-mediated pseudotype entry. These findings are in keeping with the work by Maruyama et al. [64] and with structural data indicating that HAL does possess a distorted putative sialic acid binding site [17, 24] . Contrarily, high amounts of sialidase increased entry efficiency, potentially by increasing access to the elusive receptor. In addition, removal of sialic acids might increase electrostatic interactions of batFLUAV-HAL with cell surface factors, since sialic acids are negatively charged. Although HAL-driven entry was independent of sialic acids, it did require endosomal acidification (in accordance with Maruyama et al. [64] ), which is known to trigger the membrane fusion activity of HA. Most likely, protonation also triggers bat-FLUAV-HAL for membrane fusion. However, it cannot be disregarded that the inhibitory effect of ammonium chloride was due to blockade of pH-dependent endosomal cysteine proteases, which activate the surface proteins of several coronaviruses and ebolaviruses [65] [66] [67] [68] .",

Several TTSPs can cleave and activate HA in cell culture and recent studies demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is essential for FLUAV spread in mice [32, 33, 58, 59] . Moreover, polymorphisms in TMPRSS2 were shown to impact severity of influenza in humans [69] . Treatment of bat-FLUAV-HAL-expressing cells with trypsin led to proteolytic cleavage of HAL and exposure of HAL-bearing pseudotypes to trypsin was required for efficient transduction of target cells, indicating that proteolytic processing is also required for HAL function. Moreover, coexpression of batFLUAV-HAL with TMPRSS2, DESC-1 or MSPL resulted in proteolytic cleavage of HAL and rendered the particles infectious in the absence of trypsin treatment, suggesting that bat-FLUAV-HAL can utilize human proteases for their activation. Finally, titration of the amounts of TMPRSS2 had differential effects on the proteolytic cleavage of HAL17 and HAL18 and on infectivity of pseudotypes bearing these proteins, hinting towards subtle differences in the efficiency of TMPRSS2 use by these subtypes. Whether bat TMPRSS2 is also able to cleave and activate batFLUAV-HAL remains to be investigated.",

(A) HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA or HAL proteins and either trypsin treated or cotransfected with plasmids encoding type II transmembrane serine proteases. Transfection of empty vector served as negative control. Cleavage of HA/HAL proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, employing antibodies against FLUAV-HA (\u03b1-FLUAV) and the FLAG epitope (\u03b1-FLAG). Detection of \u00df-actin served as loading control. Signals corresponding to uncleaved precursor proteins are marked by black circles, while products of proteolytic cleavage are indicated by white circles. The results were confirmed in a separate experiment. To assess proteolytic activation of HA/HAL proteins, vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes (VSVpp) were produced in cells transfected to express the indicated type II transmembrane serine proteases (B) or different amounts of TMPRSS2 (C). Pseudotypes were either directly used for transduction of EpoNi/22.1 cells (black bars) or previously treated with trypsin (white bars). At 24 h post inoculation, transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of the activity of VSVpp-encoded luciferase in cell lysates. For normalization, transduction by HA-or HAL-bearing pseudotypes that were produced in the absence of type II transmembrane serine protease expression (empty vector) and not treated with trypsin was set as 1.
