Although individual, identifiable patient records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, they are not routinely required for effective syndromic surveillance. Public concern about the routine collection of large quantities of PHI to support non-traditional public health functions may make alternative surveillance methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases increasingly desirable.",

There is substantial interest in using rou-tinely collected electronic health records to support both the detection of unusual clusters of public health events and the response to public health threats detected by other means. Such data are also useful to reduce an initial alert level, if it is clear that no unusual illness clusters exist in a community. Ideally, such systems operate automatically and include sensitive and specific statistical surveillance software and alerting systems. These are often referred to as syndromic surveillance systems [1, 2] , because they typically rely on the non-specific signs and symptoms that may provide the earliest evidence of a serious public health threat, such as anthrax or SARS.",

This exemption also applies to syndromic surveillance activities, although HIPAA was developed before large volumes of such data concerning individuals who are not suspected of having a reportable condition were being used for public health purposes in the absence of any known public health emergency. Despite the exemption, data providers may be unwilling to offer identifiable data for surveillance purposes in the face of increasing awareness of the potential costs of inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate use of PHI. Additionally, their patients may object to their providing it. These concerns are common to many developed countries and under these circumstances, designs that minimise the risk of inadvertent disclosure may be needed in order to gain the cooperation of data custodians, for surveillance systems to be feasible. The focus of this paper is on one such design, in which initial data aggregation is performed to decrease the risk of any PHI being inadvertently disclosed, before the aggregate data is centralised for subsequent statistical analysis. Although the system we describe is currently operating in the United States and many of the implementation details are specific to that context, some of the conceptual issues we describe and some of the lessons we have learned may be directly relevant to public health practice in other countries.",

This problem arises because many statistical analysis techniques applicable to surveillance, such as Generalised Linear Mixed Models [4] (GLMM), depend on the assumption that observations are statistically independent. Inference based on this assumption using ambulatory care encounter data will likely be biased if the model cannot distinguish observations from multiple encounters during a single course of illness from a single individual patient. Although the extent of this bias has not been quantified, the problem is clearly illustrated by real data. In more than half of the individuals with multiple lower respiratory syndrome encounters over a four year period from one large ambulatory care practice, a second encounter with the same syndrome was noted less than 21 days after the first encounter [1] . Our approach to this problem of statistical independence is to aggregate multiple encounters from a single individual into \"episodes\" of illness, and is described in more detail below. Reliably automating this aggregation requires that every patient's records be uniquely identifiable.",

Since data processing is distributed to the site of data collection rather than being performed at one central location, we describe this as a distributed processing surveillance system. Although this particular aspect of our work has briefly been mentioned in previous publications [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] , we present it in greater detail here, because we believe that it represents a potentially valuable alternative surveillance system design option that deserves more explanation and wider debate than it has received to date.",

Rather than collecting all needed identifiable, individual PHI records centrally for statistical processing, all PHI is pre-processed remotely, and remains secured, under the direct control of the data provider. Only aggregate data are transferred to the central datacenter for additional statistical processing, signal detection, display and distribution. At an appropriate level of aggregation, the risk of inadvertent PHI disclosure becomes very small, and may prove acceptable to data custodians and to individual patients. Although this risk is never completely absent, it is certainly decreased in aggregate data, making this approach far more acceptable to data providers in our experience, than the more traditional approach of centralized collection of directly identifiable PHI.",

In the more traditional type of system, individual patient records, often containing potentially identifiable information, such as date of birth and exact or approximate home address, are transferred, usually in electronic form, preferably through some secured method, to a central secured repository, where statistical tools can be used to develop and refine surveillance procedures. One of the main benefits of this data-processing model is that the software and statistical methods can be changed relatively easily to accommodate changes in requirements, because they only need to be changed at the one central location where analysis is taking place. As long as appropriate details have been captured for each individual encounter of interest, the raw data can be re-coded or manipulated in different ways. Only one suite of analysis code is needed, and because it is maintained at a single, central location, costs for upgrading and maintenance are small. Inadvertent disclosure of PHI is always a potential risk with centralized systems. Even where minimally identifiable data are stored in each record, the probability of being able to unambiguously identify an individual increases as multiple, potentially linkable records for that individual accrue over time.",

Our goal was to distinguish health care encounters that were related to ongoing care for any given episode of acute illness from the initial encounter that indicated the start of a new episode of a syndrome of interest. The derivation of the specific method for identifying first encounters for an episode of illness has been described in more detail elsewhere [1] . We define a new episode to begin at the first encounter after at least a 42day encounter-free interval for that specific patient and that specific syndrome. If there has been any encounter for that specific syndrome for the same individual patient within the previous 42 days, the current encounter is regarded as part of the usual ongoing care for the original encounter that signalled the start of an episode of illness of that syndrome. The start of a new episode for a different syndrome can occur during ongoing encounters for any given specific syndrome -ongoing encounters during an episode are counted as new episodes only if they are outside (i.e. at least 42 days since the last encounter)of an existing episode of the matching syndrome. As will be described later, all ongoing encounters within any syndrome are recorded, and are visible through reports under the control of the data provider, but they do not contribute to the counts that are sent to the datacentre for analysis. All of this processing requires consistent and unique patient identifiers for all encounters. We use the local patient master index record number for this purpose in the software that we provide, but these identifiers are not required once the processing is complete, and they remain under the complete control of the providers.",

PHINMS allows fully automated operation at both the datacenter and at each data provider. PHINMS communicates over an encrypted channel and usually requires no special modification to the data provider firewall, since it is only ever initiated by an outgoing request (the data provider always initiates the transfer of new data) and uses the same firewall port and protocol (SSL on port 443) as commercially encrypted services such as internet banking. PHINMS is reasonably robust to temporary connectivity problems, as it will try to resend all messages in the queue until they are delivered. Data transmission is one of the least problematic aspects of maintaining this system. We provide automatic installation software and it runs more or less instantaneously and transparently, without intervention in our experience.

For example, in Massachusetts, electronic messages are automatically sent to the Massachusetts Alert Network within minutes of detection, where they are automatically and immediately forwarded to the appropriate Public Health personnel for follow up. Available alert delivery methods in the Massachusetts system range from email through to an automated telephone text-to-speech delivery system. Responders can configure the alert delivery method for each type of alert they have subscribed to. This alerting system is independent of our distributed system, but in practice, the ready availability of reports in electronic format containing both fully and partially identifiable clinical data for all cases comprising any particular period or syndrome makes the task of the clinical responder much simpler whenever a query is received from a public health official. Electronic reports, containing clinical information and optionally, full identifiers for all encounters can be generated as required, at the provider's site, from where they can immediately be made available to public health agencies. In the NDP's current operational mode (see Figure 1 ), a public health official calls a designated clinical responder to obtain this information. Table 2 ). The \"narrow\" version, which contains fewer identifiers, provides each patient's five-year age group instead of date of birth and does not include the physician ID or medical record number (Table 3) . At the provider's discretion, the clinical responder can provide the \"narrow\" list corresponding to the cases of interest to the public health department. If on this basis public health officials decide that further investigation is warranted, they can call the clinical provider and request a review of medical records, identifying the cases of interest by date and an index number (unique within date) in the narrow line list. The clinician finds the medical record number by looking up the date and index number in the wide line list and then accesses the record itself through the usual HMO-specific means. Resources to support clinical responders were provided through our NDP grant to participating data providers.",

There are fixed costs such as programming to produce the standard input files, installation and training, associated with adding each new data provider, so we have focussed our efforts on large group practices providing ambulatory care with substantial daily volumes of encounters, completely paperless electronic medical record systems, and substantial technical resources, since these enable us to capture large volumes of transactions with each installation. Relatively large numbers of encounters are needed to ensure that estimates from statistical modelling are robust. Applying a distributed architecture to surveillance from multiple smaller practices may enable appropriately large numbers of encounters to be gathered, but may prove infeasible because of costs and lack of appropriate internal technical support and because of heterogeneity in the way ICD9 codes are recorded and assigned by each data provider. Once the programming for standard input files is completed, installation and training take approximately one day total, usually spread out over the first two weeks.
