            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses with a large positive single-stranded RNA genome (\u223c26-32 kb in length) of the subfamily Coronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome of CoV contains five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode replicase polyproteins (ORF1ab), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) flanked by a 5 -untranslated region (UTR) and a 3 -UTR. Currently, members of the subfamily Coronavirinae are classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Su et al., 2016) . CoVs can cause upper and lower respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infections in a wide variety of avian and mammalian hosts. Some CoVs are human pathogens that cause mild to severe disease, including NL63 and 229E of the genus Alphacoronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), OC43, and HKU1 of the genus Betacoronavirus (Dijkman and van der Hoek, 2009; Desforges et al., 2014; van den Brand et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2016) . The SARS pandemic originated in Guangdong Province in China between 2002 and 2003 , and spread to 29 countries, resulting in nearly 8,000 cases and 800 deaths worldwide (Donnelly et al., 2004) . Since being discovered in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected 2,260 people with a current fatality rate of 35.5% (Mackay and Arden, 2015; van den Brand et al., 2015; de Wit et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "With the discovery of diverse wildlife-borne CoVs in different regions of the world, previous studies have indicated that bats are the main and original natural reservoirs of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus (Calisher et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2012) . The special metabolic and immune systems allow bats to tolerate diverse viruses, and the social roosting behavior of many bat species lets them serve as ideal incubators for the occurrence of frequent co-infection, recombination, and intraspecies transmission of CoVs O'Shea et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Sola et al., 2015) . Although 15 years have passed without a recurrence of the SARS outbreak, the consistent discovery of SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) in Rhinolophus bats indicates an ongoing risk of SARS reemergence Balboni et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016b; Hu et al., 2017) . Recently, a CoV of Rhinolophus bat origin, swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), was found to be responsible for the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms in Guangdong Province (Zhou et al., 2018) . Besides similar clinical signs, the outbreak of SADS coincided with infection by another swine enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; Zhou et al., 2018) . It is worth mentioning that a PEDV-related bat CoV, BtCoV/512, was previously identified in Scotophilus kuhlii bats (Tang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) . All of these findings emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring for ecological diversity of CoVs in bats to minimize the impact of potential CoV-related diseases on public health and economic growth.",

After that, in the following 13 years, the constant discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs suggested the risk of re-emergence of SARS-CoV originating from bat species. Other than that, two CoV-related cases, human MERS in 2012 and SADS in 2017, which had a great impact on health and the economy were identified as being of bat origin (Omrani et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018) . In our previous study, a largescale virome analysis was conducted between 2010 and 2013 to understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases. Rhinolophus bats in Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces have provided genetic clues to the origin of SARS-CoV, and a SADS-CoV-and HKU2related CoV, BtRf-alphaCoV/YN2012, has also been found in Yunnan Province (Wu et al., 2016a) . Sichuan Province has diverse wildlife resources and the largest pig breeding in China, and a MERS-related CoV was reported in bats in this province in 2013 (Yang et al., 2014) . It is necessary for us to conduct continuous surveillance for the prevalence, genetic diversity and geographical distribution of CoVs in some bat species in these potential high-risk regions. Using virome analysis, our study investigated the presence and genetic diversity of CoVs circulating in bat species from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangxi Provinces between 2016 and 2017.",
