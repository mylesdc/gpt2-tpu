However, the majority of the single mAbs described to date do not bind and neutralize viral isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes clustering into the two different HA-based influenza phylogenetic groups: the group 1 including, among others, subtypes H1, H2, H5 and H9 and the group 2 including, among others, H3 subtype. Here, we describe a human mAb, named PN-SIA28, capable of binding and neutralizing all tested isolates belonging to phylogenetic group 1, including H1N1, H2N2, H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes and several isolates belonging to group 2, including H3N2 isolates from the first period of the 1968 pandemic. Therefore, PN-SIA28 is capable of neutralizing isolates belonging to subtypes responsible of all the reported pandemics, as well as other subtypes with pandemic potential. The region recognized by PN-SIA28 has been identified on the stem region of HA and includes residues highly conserved among the different influenza subtypes. A deep characterization of PN-SIA28 features may represent a useful help in the improvement of available anti-influenza therapeutic strategies and can provide new tools for the development of universal vaccinal strategies.",

            "text": "Influenza, one of the diseases that has shaped human history [1, 2] , still has an evident clinical and socio-economical impact [3, 4] . The 2009 pandemic has raised several major concerns related to the few prophylactic and therapeutic measures available. Antiviral compounds have drawbacks caused by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant isolates [5, 6] , require prompt administration to be effective [7] , and have several associated side-effects especially in high-risk categories, including children and pregnant women [8, 9] . Additionally, the vaccinal strategy is exposed to the annual risk of being ineffective due to possible mismatches between the predicted strains included in the vaccine and those actually in circulation; moreover, it would not engender a prompt response in pandemic settings [10] . In this scenario, new broadrange ''universal'' anti-influenza strategies are required [11, 12] . In particular, it would be important to identify and eventually elicit what has recently been described as an unusually extreme broadrange immunity directed against broadly conserved viral regions, differing from the more common and restricted immunity directed against highly variable regions [12] . A number of approaches have already been proposed in literature [10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] , but a pivotal role, both in the prophylactic and therapeutic field, may be played by the availability of broad-range neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) allowing the identification of human B epitopes widely shared among different influenza subtypes [11, 12] . Indeed, it is accepted that antibodies are key players in natural protection against influenza viruses, and that hemagglutinin (HA) is the main target for the virus-neutralizing antibody response [17] . However, although a single influenza infection provides lifelong immunity against the infecting virus and a limited number of antigenically correlated strains, the host can remain susceptible to infection with an antigenically drifted variant due to HA variability [18] .",

The sixteen known subtypes of HA, sharing between 40% and 60% amino acid sequence identity, have been clustered in two distinct phylogenetic groups: group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15) [12, 14] . The subtypes, H1, H2, H5 and H9 in group 1, and H3 and H7 in group 2 have been isolated in humans and in particular H1, H2 and H3 subtypes have been responsible of the reported influenza pandemic outbreaks. In this study, we describe a human mAb, named PN-SIA28, that is capable of neutralizing all tested group 1 isolates, as well as isolates belonging to H3N2, the only group 2 subtype capable, so far, of causing a pandemic.",

The results obtained showed that IgG PN-SIA28 strongly neutralizes viruses belonging to the group 1 as well as those of the group 2. More in details, IgG PN-SIA28 neutralized all the H1N1 tested viruses with an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) ranging between 0.4-3.7 mg/ml, the H5N1 viruses with IC 50 ranging between 0.9-2.8 mg/ml, the H2N2 subtype isolate with an IC 50 of 0.8 mg/ml and the H9N2 subtype strain with an IC 50 of 0.9 mg/ml (Table 1, Figure S1 ). More interestingly, IgG PN-SIA28, also potently neutralizes H3N2 viruses circulating in the years from 1968 to 1975 with IC 50 ranging between 0.8-2.6 mg/ml (Table 1, Figure S2 ) despite the great phylogenetic distance of these viruses compared to those belonging to group 1 ( Figure 1 ).

            "text": "The broad neutralizing activity of PN-SIA28 against highly divergent influenza viruses, suggests that the epitope recognized is extremely conserved. The lack of hemagglutination inhibitory activity and the competition with a mouse mAb (C179) directed against the stem region of HA, had already suggested that PN-SIA28 epitope is not localized on the globular head and that it is shared between HA1 and HA2 domains [19, 20] . Several approaches have been used in this study to better define the region recognized by PN-SIA28. The screening of a phagemidic random peptide library suggested the binding of PN-SIA28 to the stem region in the proximity of the viral membrane. Interestingly, the sequence analysis of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) escape mutants, generated under PN-SIA28 selective pressure, identified two residues (Ile361 and Asp362) localized in close proximity to the residues identified with the peptide library approach. It is worth noting that none of these two specific mutations is present in any of the more than 6,000 sequences available in public influenza databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html), suggesting that the immune pressure on these residues is poor and that the region is functionally highly conserved in all subtypes (rate of non-conservative substitutions: 0.17% for residue 361, and 8.7% for residue 362). Based on these data, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) HA mutants carrying an alanine substitution in position 361 (Ile361Ala) or in position 362 (Asp362Ala) were generated and the FACS analysis showed that PN-SIA28 lost most of its capability to bind the mutated HA, in concordance with the data obtained from the escape mutants. The residue in position 361 was also mutated in Valine (Ile361Val), an aminoacid largely present in most of the neutralized isolates (Figure 2 ), indeed confirming that the presence of this residue did not affect binding.",

The more restricted panel of alanine mutants (His25Ala, Asn45Ala, Ile361Ala and Asp362Ala) generated for A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) HA, confirmed the key role of some of the residues already identified as implicated in the interaction of PN-SIA28 with HA (H1) (Figure 4 ). Three more mutants were generated considering the differences among solvent exposed residues close to PN-SIA28 epitope-core on HA stem region between A/Victoria/3/1975 (the most recent neutralized isolate) and A/Philippines/2/1982 (the earliest non neutralized strain) isolates. The only mutant partially affecting PN-SIA28 binding was the one on Lys57, a residue present among all H3N2 neutralized strains and substituted by several different residues among H3N2 not neutralized strains. This could partially explaining the lack of neutralizing activity against most recent strains ( Figure 5 and Table S1 ).",

In addition, the region bound is also partially shared with FI6v3, an optimized human mAb able to crossneutralize influenza A group 1 and group 2 viruses [32] . Importantly, both the heavy chains of PN-SIA28 and FI6v3 derive from rearrangement of the same VH gene germline (VH3-30). As already hypothesized for the VH1-69 subfamily, widely shared among human mAbs with heterosubtypic neutralizing activity limited to group 1 viruses, the VH3-30 gene structure may be important in conferring the broader heterosubtypic activity observed for PN-SIA28 and FI6v3. The future definition of HA/ PN-SIA28 crystal structure and its comparison with HA/FI6v3 complex may help confirm the possible role of conserved VH3-30 residues in conferring such unusual neutralization properties.",

Firstly, it was previously speculated that the presence of an additional glycosilation site (Asn54 corresponding to His45 present on group 1 viruses) on the HA1 portion of the stem region in H3N2 viruses is the reason for the lack of anti-H3N2 activity of other mAbs with heterosubtypic activity limited to group 1 subtypes [25, 26, 30] . The present study demonstrates that this extra glycosilation site on H3N2 does not preclude PN-SIA28 binding and neutralizing activity against viruses belonging to this subtype ( Figure 2 ). The testing of HA alanine mutants for position His45 on H1N1 and Asn54 on H3N2, and the increased binding of PN-SIA28 to Asn54His mutant on H3N2, confirm that this key residue is particularly important for the interaction of PN-SIA28 with HA. However, other residues, including Lys57 and others not yet identified, certainly play an important role in the PN-SIA28 binding to HA, as shown by the lack of activity observed against the recent H3N2 isolates tested, as well as against the H7N2 isolate, despite a substantial identity in the studied region ( Figure 2 ).",

As a consequence, PN-SIA28 could be crucial in the identification of promising HAbased vaccinal strategies aimed at the elicitation of a broadly heterosubtypic protective immunity similar to the one represented by this human mAb. As described for a few other mAbs [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41] , PN-SIA28 is mainly directed against the highly conserved HA2 domain whose use in novel anti-influenza vaccinal approaches is being widely investigated. However, PN-SIA28 demonstrates that not all antibodies directed against the stem region have the same characteristics, and that their neutralizing activity is modulated by the specifically recognized epitope. Indeed, the data presented in this paper show that in the design of such innovative approaches (i.e. the so-called ''headless approach'' [16] ) it is important to identify also residues belonging to HA1 domain to be preserved to elicit the widest immunity. Several immunogens are usually obtained on the basis of in silico analysis, but their real protective potential can only be ascertained after time-consuming and expensive in vivo studies. Under this perspective, PN-SIA28 could therefore be an extremely important reagent to identify immunogens more likely to stimulate antibodies with a similar broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity that will constitute the best candidates for further in vivo studies.",
