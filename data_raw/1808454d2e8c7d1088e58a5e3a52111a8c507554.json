In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases. In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses. Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains. Conclusions: Overall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide. Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. If these preliminary observations will be confirmed, improved molecular methods with a wider panel of potential pathogens will be useful for monitoring these categories of patients.",

Some serotypes support respiratory infections, and it has been confirmed that they are responsible for bronchopneumonias and occasional fatal cases [1] [2] [3] [4] . As for many RNA viruses, the genetic evolution of HEV occurs over time by means of point mutations and recombination phenomena allowing the virus to adapt to environment modifications and host selective pressure [2, 5, 6] . This genetic evolution is linked directly to virulence characteristics, tissue tropism and hence to the pathogenic potential of these viruses [5, 7] . More than 100 different serotypes of non polio enteroviruses have been recognized and recently two new enterovirus, the HEV104 and the HEV109, classified within HEV species C, were reported in association with respiratory diseases [8] .",

This is the first report of this virus in a transplanted patient with respiratory symptoms. The retrospective evaluation carried out in a pediatric department in the same geographic area throughout a period of six years proves that in infants below two years old and hospitalised for ARDs, the circulation of EV109 was low (0.2%) and concentrated in a the same period (November 2005-February 2006) suggesting that the newly identified enterovirus may cause sporadic epidemics in northern Italy. The sequence analysis performed on 950 bases along the UTR, the VP4 and VP2 regions showed only a few differences in the nucleotide sequence of our strains compared with the Nicaragua strains. The UTR amplified region crosses the putative area of recombination that was observed in HEV109 and the limited variability observed suggests that this recombination is very old and that this strain has circulated worldwide [10] . Some results may point towards a possible role of this virus as co-pathogen in ARDs in infants. In fact, in the paediatric cases of this study, even if with other co-infections, EV109 was only detected in samples from infants with L-ARD. Moreover, we observed a very low difference in amino acid sequences between isolates of this study and those described in Nicaragua in symptomatic patients. However we must underling that since 78% of our pediatric samples were from infants with lower tract disease, we cannot exclude a population bias in our observations and more cases of HEV109 infections and larger studies are needed to definitively clarify this point. In fact no HEV109 single infections were observed in pediatric patients and the limited number of HEV109 cases didn't allows a statistically significant comparison of HEV109 co-infection severity compared to HEV109 negative co-infections as we described in previous papers for other pathogens [11, 12] .",

Other pathogens, including HRV infections were common and as previously documented for hMPV [13, 14] , frequently asymptomatic in this group of patients, including the majority of rhinoviruses infections due to HRV-C strain (data not shown). Respiratory syndromes were indeed not common in transplant recipients and only 16 out of 54 transplant patients suffered sporadic episodes of upper respiratory symptoms. As recently suggested however, since symptomatic and also asymptomatic viral infections can trigger acute rejection and obliterative bronchiolitis in lung transplant recipients [15] the role of this new HEV needs to be clearly elucidated.",

            "text": "in MEGA was previously estimated directly from the data by using PAUP).Since multiple infections are frequently detected in respiratory samples of patients with respiratory symptoms and to better clarify the pathogenetic role of the novel enterovirus in co-infections, all specimens positive for HEV109 were also assayed for the presence of other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses (PIV 1-3), influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), adenoviruses, human coronaviruses (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and for WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) polyomaviruses using a multiplex PCR strategy (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection, Seegene, Rockville) and in house protocols [11] [12] [13] . Presence of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) in HEV109 positive samples from infants and in all samples from immunosuppressed patients were also investigated by molecular analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction. Samples were subjected to first round one step reverse transcription and amplification (Super-ScriptIII OneStep RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) after RNA extraction using Primers P1-1 (CAA GCA CTT CTG TYW CCC C) and P3-1 (ACG GAC ACC CAA AGT AG) and the following thermal profile: 20 min 50\u00b0C, 10 min 95\u00b0C, followed by 15 'touchdown' cycles (The steps were 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 68\u00b0C down to 52\u00b0C (2\u00b0C intervals) for 30 s), and 25 cycles at 94\u00b0C 30 s, 52\u00b0C 30 s and a final extention step at 68\u00b0C for 40 s.; 5 \u03bcl of first RT-PCR reaction underwent a semi-nested amplification using the Platinum TaqDNA Polimerase (Invitrogen) and the forward primer P1-1 and three reversed primers P2-1 (TTA GCC ACA TTC AGG GGC), P2-2 (TTA GCC ACA TTC AGG AGC C) and P2-3 (TTA GCC GCA TTC AGG GG) as described previously with minor modifications [17] . In all amplification protocols primers were used at a final concentration of 200 nM. Amplification specificity was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic internal control used to exclude contaminations [18, 19] .Since this amplification protocol amplified also HEV109 homologous target sequence, in co-infected samples, amplifications products after gel electrophoresis (data not shown) were individually gel extracted (using Qiagen mini elute gel extraction kit) and sequenced to confirm amplification specificity. In all HRV samples when visualized in the gel only the nested amplification product of about 300 bp was observed. In the co-infected samples instead, after both amplification reaction, an additional 390 bp band was indeed always present that when sequenced independently corresponded to the HEV109 genome amplified with the outer primers. We cannot exclude that a deeper clonal analyses of each band would have demonstrated the presence of both viruses in both amplification products, however in the mono-infected transplant recipient patient the inner amplification product corresponded to the HEV only when sequenced.",
