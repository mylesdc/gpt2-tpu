Sequence diversity and selection pressure of different genomic regions among DENV-3 different genotypes was further examined to understand the global DENV-3 evolution. The highest nucleotide sequence diversity among the fully sequenced DENV-3 strains was found in the nonstructural protein 2A (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.84 \u00b1 0.54) and envelope protein gene regions (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.04 \u00b1 0.32). Further analysis found that positive selection pressure of DENV-3 may occur in the non-structural protein 1 gene region and the positive selection site was detected at position 178 of the NS1 gene.",

Infection with dengue viruses (DENV), which are maintained in a human-mosquito transmission cycle involving primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, can result in various clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to DF, DHF, DSS and death [3] . The occurrences of dengue epidemics in the past 30 years have been characterized by the rising incidence rates of infection and continuous expansion in geographic distribution of DHF epidemics [4] . Importantly, the epidemics of DHF have become progressively larger in the last 20 years in many dengue endemic countries [5] . The increasingly widespread distribution and the rising incidence of DF and DHF are related to increased distribution of A. aegypti, global urbanization and rapid and frequent international travel.",

The large DHF epidemics in Indonesia in the 1970s and Sri Lanka after 1989 provided evidence supporting this phenomenon [8, 9] . Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) re-appeared in Latin Americain 1994 after its absence for seventeen years. The virus was detected initially in Panama and soon dispersed throughout Central and South America during the following years [10, 11] . This introduction coincided with an increased number of DHF cases in this region.

            "text": "Dengue is caused by four antigenically related but genetically distinct viruses (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4) belonging to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae [12] . DENV is a single stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, approximately 10,700 nucleotides in length. The genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein, which is co-and post-translationally processed to produce three structural proteins, including capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [12, 13] . A considerable number of studies have revealed that each serotype of DENV is composed of phylogenetically distinct clusters that have been classified into \"genotypes\" or \"subtypes,\" and each genotype is also composed of phylogenetically distinct \"groups\" or \"clades.\" A previous study has classified DENV-3 strains into four genotypes based on limited numbers of nucleic acid sequences from the prM and E protein genes [6] ; DENV-3 strains have also been re-classified into five genotypes [14] . Growing evidence suggests the existence of DENV strains with different epidemic potentials. This evidence is supported by the following observations: (1) the differences in fitness among various genotypes of DENV-2 reflect their different replication capabilities in human monocytes and dendritic cells [15] ; (2) around 1991, clade replacement among DENV-3 genotype II containing isolates from Thailand was associated with changing serotype prevalence and incidence of DHF epidemics [16] ; and (3) sudden changes in the genotype of DENV at a single locality have been observed that appeared to originate from the genetic bottleneck of a large viral population [14, 17] . This sudden genotype replacement has been associated with more severe DHF epidemics in Indonesia and Sri Lanka [9, 18] . However, most of these studies involved the E gene alone. This raises an important question: Is the introduction of different DENV genotypes in disparate geographical locations a result of sequence differences outside of the E gene altering their epidemic potential, or it is simply a stochastic event in viral evolution?",

The re-emergence of dengue outbreaks in Taiwan started when DENV-2 was re-introduced into the off-islet of Hsiao-Liu-Chiu in 1981. In 1987-1988, another large-scale DENV-1 outbreak occurred in Kaohsiung and Pingtung in southern Taiwan [19] . Although DENV-3 was detected sporadically from imported index cases, no DENV-3-related epidemic occurred until 11 DHF cases were confirmed in Kaohsiung in 1994 and 23 DHF cases in Tainan in 1998 [20] . Taiwan neighbors many Southeast Asian countries and more than 25,000 travelers visit these adjacent countries annually. The surveillance system implemented by the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) routinely detects many imported dengue cases each year. Thus, Taiwan is an ideal place to study the evolution and dispersion of DENV that may have different epidemic potential, particularly in the 1994 and 1998 DHF epidemics in Taiwan that coincided with the DHF epidemics in Southeast Asian countries [21] . Complete genomic sequencing of DENV-3 strains collected from different geographical locations and isolation years offers the opportunity to understand the genetic stasis and possible selection pressure sites in the DENV genome other than within the E gene.",

Pairwise comparisons of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences of DENV-3 isolates were performed using the program MEGA v3.1 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, Pennsylvania State University, PA) to determine the mean and range of the proportional difference (p-distance) [28] . The model of nucleotide substitution that best described DENV-3 sequence evolution was identified using the program Modeltest 3.0 [29] . The resulting most complex GTR+I+\u0393 substitution model (general time reversible model, GTR, a proportion of sites modeled as invariant, I, variation in rates among sites modeled using the gamma distribution, \u00c3) was selected to be the best fit to the data using the hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) and Akaine information criterion (AIC). The estimated parameter values from this model were as follows: relative substitution rates among nucleotides were A \u2194 C = 1.6120, A \u2194 G = 9.5789, A \u2194 T = 1.7255, C \u2194 G = 0.6272, C \u2194 T = 29.7738, G \u2194 T = 1.0; proportion of invariable sites (I) was 0.4475; gamma distribution of among-site rate variation (\u00c3) was 1.2293; and estimated base composition of A = 0.3268, C = 0.2145, G = 0.2539, and T = 0.2048. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree using these parameter settings was estimated using the DNAML in Phylip v3.6 package [30] . Bootstrap analysis with 1,000 re-samplings was used to determine confidence values for groupings within the phylogenetic tree. In addition, a posterior probability distribution tree, generated by implementing the recently developed Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic model utilizing a Metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MC) 3 algorithm in the MrBayes program (version 3.1, [31] ) was compared with the evolutionary tree of DENV-3 generated by the ML method. Indeed, the Bayesian approaches for constructing phylogenetics have several advantages. First, the primary analysis often provides faster estimates of the tree and measurements than the estimates obtained using ML bootstrapping techniques. Secondly, Bayesian model selection offers advantages over likelihood methods in that the competing evolutionary hypotheses need not to be nested, and it does not rely on standard likelihood assumptions. In other words, the starting trees in Bayesian method are randomly chosen, and multiple runs of the same dataset are generally made with different starting trees to check convergence of the process. The programs' default settings for prior probability were used in our analysis. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) processes, considering the heterogeneity in the evolutionary process and thus incorporating a discrete gamma distribution of four classes of substitution rates across mutation sites, were run for 500,000 generations. Output trees were sampled every 100 generations but the first 1,000 trees were discarded before the process reached the convergence state. The resulting trees were rooted using a DENV-1 strain A88 isolate as described.",

This method presents major advantages over simpler pairwise comparisons in considering the transition/transversion rate bias, non-uniform codon usage, and phylogenetic relationships among the sequences [32] . Positive selection at a small number of codons can be detected by comparing various models of codon evolution which differ in how the rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions (denoted as \u03c9) are treated among codons or within lineages using likelihood ratio tests. To analyze selection pressures at individual codons, we compared the M7 and M8 model. In the M7 model, 10 categories were assigned and estimated from the data, which specified only neutral evolution; however, the M8 model allowed positive selection by add-ing an 11 th codon category at which dN/dS can exceed 1.0. To examine selection pressures along the lineages, the free ratio model, which allows certain lineages to have \u03c9 ratios different from the background, was implemented in the M3 model. Additionally, parameters involving the incorporation of classes of codons where \u03c9 >1 were used by comparing the value of the likelihood from M0, in which the specified neutral evolution of \u03c9 is constrained to be equal to or less than 1 at all codons among all lineages. The comparison was again assessed using the likelihood ratio test. If positive selection was found, the Bayesian method was applied to identify the specific codon that may have been subjected to positive selection pressure.",

This stimulates a great interest in understanding the molecular relationship of DENV-3 isolates in Taiwan during interepidemic periods and in comparing them with the strains circulating globally to understand evolutionary trends and geographical expansions. Here, we confirmed that the dengue epidemics in Taiwan were strongly associated with the globally circulating DENV-3 due to constant introduction of viruses from Southeast Asia by Taiwanese travelers.

The high nucleotide sequence identity (> 99.8%) among the strains isolated in 1998 indicates that they were from a single origin and further spread to different townships, such as Pingtung (ID#98TW358). The only 1998 imported DENV-3 isolated from a traveler who had recently visited Indonesia was more closely associated with the genotype II isolates from Myanmar and older isolates from Thailand. This virus differed from the virus isolated during the 1998 Tainan outbreak, which might suggest that multiple genotypes of DENV-3 circulated in Indonesia. This observation is consistent with a previous study indicating that at least two subtypes of DENV-3 were present in Indonesia [18] . The phylogenetic analysis also suggested that a single 1999 isolate (ID#99TW628) from the same location as the 1998 epidemic was grouped together with the genotype III Sri Lanka isolates. Additional DENV-3 isolates from the first DENV-3-caused DHF outbreak in Taiwan (1994) (1995) were grouped into genotype I. All these results implicated that repeated introductions of different genotypes of DENV-3 into Taiwan since 1994 were important causes of dengue epidemics, and that DENV-3 was not endemic in Taiwan. This situation may be similar in the subtropical region of China. Our country initiated airport fever screening during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003-04, and it successfully identified 40 confirmed, imported dengue cases [22] . Airport fever screening can thus quickly identify imported dengue cases, and may prevent a significant number of dengue outbreaks that would have been initiated by imported index cases. However, its cost-effectiveness in preventing any dengue epidemics in Taiwan will need to be evaluated in the future. With different DENV-3 genotypes imported into Taiwan from Southeast Asia and other parts of the world, this virus collection provides an excellent opportunity to examine the sequence diversity of different genes of the full-length DENV-3 viral RNA genome for genotypes other than genotype IV. The highest p-distance of nucleotide diversity of the full-length genomes occurred for the NS2A gene (5.84% \u00b1 0.54%), followed by the E gene (5.04% \u00b1 0.32%).

This observation is consistent with the previous analysis in DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 [16, 34] , although the precise cause of the increased rate of amino acid change in the NS2A gene is unknown. A similar observation could also be made while analyzing the full genomic sequences of West Nile virus (WNV) isolated from different animal species [35] . The flavivirus NS2A, a protein important for viral replication and particle formation [12] , is cleaved by viral serine protease. A mutation at the basic P1 cleavage site residue in NS2A blocks this processing event and is lethal for virus production while still allowing RNA replication [36, 37] . Furthermore, this basic residue in NS2A and an acidic residue in NS3 are important determinants for virus assembly and/or release [38] . Although the relative high sequence diversity of the NS2A gene of DENV-3 may be due to the lesser structural constraint required for NS2A, it is possible that positive selection pressures may be exerted on this gene. Especially in light of recent studies, NS2A together with NS4B and NS4A were identified as dengue virus-encoded proteins that could antagonize the interferon (IFN) response during viral infection [39, 40] . Our analysis didn't detect any selection pressure exerted on the NS2A gene probably due to the small sample size; future studies will be needed to focus the selection pressure analysis on non-structural proteins and DENV evolution.",

These substitutions resulted in changes of its polarity, hydrophobicity or charge. Especially notable was the change from L to S at position 178 of the NS1 region, which is an amino acid substitution unique to genotype II. This might be the result of positive selection within the lineage of genotype II but not other genotypes. All DENV-3 isolates from Thailand belong to genotype II, and interestingly, based on a previous publication [16] , strains of DENV-3 isolated prior to 1992 in Thailand may have been replaced by two new locally evolving strains. This could be a sign of a new genotype evolving in Thailand; however, most of the mutations or substitutions occurring were deleterious and a purifying selection of DENV-3 was suggested [16] . It is very likely that the previous analysis focused on only the E protein gene. Determining the possibility of a positive natural selection site in the non-structural genes of the new Thailand lineage will require further study. A number of T-and B-cell epitopes are present on the non-structural proteins, especially the NS1 gene [41] [42] [43] . Even though the biological significance of the L to S change at position 178 of the NS1 region is unclear, growing evidence supported by in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that there are certain evolutionary forces acting on the NS1 gene shaping the gene flow of the dengue viral population, which might differ during viral replication in mammalian and mosquito cells [44, 45] . This is the first time that a positive selection pressure site was detected in a non-structural protein in DENV-3 and its importance together with its functional relevance to epidemic severity will need to be examined with a larger sample size.",

            "text": "The global distribution of different genotypes of DENV-3 indicates that they originated in Southeast Asia; these genotypes demonstrated higher epidemic potential with regards to severe DHF epidemics in Sri Lanka, Central and South America [46, 47] . Genotype III, once its transmission cycle was established locally, soon resulted in DHF epidemics regardless of an increase in virus transmission or a change in circulating serotypes [7, 14] , supporting the hypothesis that virus strain is an important risk factor for DHF [48, 49] . Two sub-lineages (isolated before and after 1989) existed within the DENV-3 genotype III strains from Sri Lanka, and the viruses isolated after 1989 were associated with the DHF epidemic [7] . We found that the strain isolated in 1999 from a indigenous dengue patient (99TW628) that did not lead to a large-scale epidemic of DF or DHF was more closely related to the lineage of the DENV-3 genotype III Sri Lankan strain isolated before 1989. Similarly, in Indonesia two sub-lineages of DENV-3 were present (isolated before and after 1998), and a greater DHF epidemic, especially in adult cases, was caused by the DENV-3 strains isolated after 1998 [50] . The DENV-3 strain isolated in Taiwan during the DHF outbreak in 1994 was actually more closely related to the old Indonesian strain of genotype I from 1976-78. While it is currently unknown how the different sub-lineages within each genotype are associated with different DHF epidemic potential, a recent publication suggested that changing serotype prevalence could lead to differential susceptibility to cross-reactive immune responses [16] . Furthermore, Wearing et al suggested that both vector and short-termed host cross-immunity are two factors responsible for dengue epidemics [51] . It would be necessary to strengthen comprehensive dengue virological surveillance, especially in those endemic and hyper-endemic areas/countries, to monitor the emergence of DENV strains with epidemic potential for better epidemic prevention and vaccine development.",
