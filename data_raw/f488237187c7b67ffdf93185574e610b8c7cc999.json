Prepare a 900 \u00b5l aliquot of vigorously mixed Agencourt AMPure XP beads in a 1.5 \u00b5l tube. Using this aliquot, pipet AMPure XP beads into 1.5 ml tubes for the Bead:DNA ratios as given in the Table below (vortex the bead aliquot and change pipet tips between each sample; pipet and dispense slowly without aspirating any air and without having beads on the outside of the tip): Prepare sample and control DNA Ladder: Sample DNA Ladder: Pipet 48 \u00b5l of DNA Ladder to a new tube and dilute with 1152 \u00b5l Nuclease-free water; thoroughly mix by vortexing and spin down briefly. Control DNA Ladder: Dilute 4 \u00b5l DNA Ladder with 6 \u00b5l Nuclease-free water; thoroughly mix and spin down briefly. Pipet 100 \u00b5l of diluted sample DNA Ladder to each bead aliquot from step above; mix by pipetting 15 times and incubate 5 min at room temperature. Place the reaction tube onto the MPC for 5 min to separate the beads from supernatant (until the beads have concentrated on the tube wall). Slowly aspirate the cleared solution from the reaction tube without disturbing the beads and discard the solution; keep the reaction tube in the MPC while aspirating the solution. Dispense 500 \u00b5l 70% ethanol to each reaction tube and incubate 30 s at room temperature. Slowly aspirate the ethanol from the reaction tube and discard. Repeat the ethanol step. Air-dry the pellet for 10 min with the cap open (keeping on MPC). Take reaction tube from MPC, elute DNA with 10 \u03bcl Tris-HCl by careful pipette mixing and incubate for 2 min. Place the reaction tube onto the MPC, incubate for 2 min (until the beads have concentrated on the tube wall) and transfer the supernatant containing DNA Ladder into the respectively labelled clean reaction tube.

            "text": "Step 29. Typical results of the Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA pico assay are shown in Figure 3 . In lanes marked with C intact total RNA is evident from rRNA peaks. In lanes marked with T ( Fig. 3 , A+B) and M (Fig. 3, C) , rRNA peaks are partly or completely missing because of degradation of RNA. The Bacillus subtilis samples (spore) are also shown as electropherograms (Fig. A1 ). The cryoPrep sample shows the most intact RNA whereas the TissueLyser sample shows very degraded RNA. From the generated electropherogram, the software calculates an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) that can help in assessing RNA quality. According to our experience, however, there is no correlation between pathogen detection or sequence data output and the RIN value. In some cases, the extracted RNA had only a low concentration and needed to be concentrated (using steps 31-38 of the protocol) before cDNA synthesis. This was done for the bird feces, tap water and the pizza samples. Compare Fig. A3 for resulting libraries. Step 109. The size-selected library is composed of fragments ranging from 300 to 1,000 bp with a peak at about 500-550 bp. Ideally, the library should show a representative or weak peak (Fig. A3 , sheep pool ID 1454, containing an astrovirus 4 , or wild boar with trichina ID 1806, respectively). For the trichina-sample, we obtained 0.02% trichinellid reads (data set of 1,627,077 reads). But also in cases without a peak, virus reads can be detected depending on the viral load. This was for example the case in the meat loaf sample ID 1488 ( Fig. A3 ) that contained 319 reads (0.1%) of a pepper mild mottle virus 6.36 kb genome (99% identity, RNA virus) representing a plant pathogen (total data set 360,148 reads). Step 120. After completion of the run, check fluorescence intensity, amplification curves, melting curves for integrity and plausibility of the PCR results. The relative standard deviation of replicates should be < 10% and R 2 of the standard curve \u2265 0.95, PCR efficiency \u2265 0.95, efficiencies between 0.90 and 0.95 are acceptable if R 2 is \u2265 0.99. Check also the Cq values of different sample dilutions for plausibility.",
