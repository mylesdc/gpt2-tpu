Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2, a receptor of EV71 and CVA16) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections. In this study, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody, N3. A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 (B4 genotype) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 (C2 genotype). This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain, spinal cord and limb muscles. Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines were all reduced. The protective efficacy of N3 was not observed in animals challenged with CVA16. This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in CVA16. These results indicate N3 could be useful in treating severe EV71 infections and the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates.",

Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse-adapted strain of EV71 [5] , innate immunodeficient mice [6] , or monkey models [7] . The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms. Administration of mouse-adapted EV71 strain 4643 (Tainan/ 4643/98) to 1-d-old ICR mice caused hind limb paralysis (LP) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [8] . Challenge of 1-d-old BALB/C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [5] . A deficiency in type I and type II IFN receptors of the AG129 mouse cause neurological manifestations after infection with the non-mouse adapted EV71 strain (5865/SIN/00009; [6] ). The EV71 BrCr strain, an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [9] , was demonstrated to induce neurological manifestations of tremor, ataxia, and brain edema, but no pulmonary edema (PE) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys [7] . These models are not perfect for HFMD or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71. Viral pathogenesis in mouseadapted EV71-infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe (up to one week old of mouse age) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71. In addition, innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, involved for the EV71-induced pathogenic phenotype was reported [10, 11] .",

The HFMD-like skin rashes were observed in transgenic mice pre-infected with clinical isolates E59 (genotype B4 of EV71) and N2838 (B5); severe limb paralysis and death in transgenic mice pre-inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 (C2), N3340 (C4) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) [11] . EV71 viral loads in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, CCL3, TNF-a, and IL-6), correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that resulted in severe diseases in transgenic mice [11] . It was also observed in EV71 patients with encephalitis associated with PE that have a higher mortality rate (64.3%) than patients with brainstem encephalitis (26.3%) [13, 14] , PE might be caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from brainstem lesions caused by the excessive release of IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IFN-c [13, 15, 16] . In this study, we investigate whether the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71-specific neutralizing antibody, N3 [17] . Administration of N3 to transgenic mice reduced the developed hair loss and scurfy skin as well as limb paralysis induced by E59 infection and protected from severe limb paralysis resulting in death by 5746 infection. This protection associates with the reduction of the viral load in the brain, spinal cords, and limb muscles. It also associated with the reduction of the secreted proinflammatory mediators in tissues. These results demonstrated N3 might have potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of EV71-induced severely HFMD patients.",

The viral genomes in infected 3T3-SCARB2 cells were detected by RT-PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to VP1 sequence of P1 transcripts of E59 or 5746 isolates. The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of P1 of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner.

The muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3, compared to the section of normal muscle tissue (MOCK) (Fig. 5B ). Our previous study had showed that microvilli in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [11] . To investigate whether the EV71-induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not, histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed.

Higher expression of CCL3 observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes (neutrophils) during inflammation in the brain. Cytokine storm is thus proposed to cause severe symptoms. Administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13] [14] [15] 20] . We measured the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues of 5746-infected mice while receiving N3.

This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross-neutralization of N3 against CVA16 (Fig. S2 ). Indeed, N3 was able to recognize CVA16 virions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA (for na\u00efve protein interaction; Fig. S3 ) and Western blot (for denatured protein interaction; Fig. S4 ). In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains, N3 showed lower affinity to na\u00efve CVA16 (Fig. S3) . Oppositely, anti-CVA16 antisera, obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16, equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig. S4 . N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins of both B4 and C2 EV71 at approximately 35 kDa [17, 21] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [22] that is different from anti-CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa.",

The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Previously, We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2-transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates, the early syndrome of HFMD, followed by progressively neurological LP were developed. In addition, hSCARB2-transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal neurological diseases. Despite the muscle-tropic EV71 viremia in the reported model that differ from the CNS-tropism of EV71 infection in humans, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were characterized as bi-pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites [11] .",

Previously, we generated 4 murine monoclonal antibodies that cross-neutralized subgenogroup B isolates of EV71 in vitro. Therefore, we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model. Here we show that by using N3, hSCARB2-transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD-like and paralytic symptoms. We concluded that treatment of N3 (200 mg) at an early stage (3 h post infection) after infection afforded complete protection. A lower dose (70 mg) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90% protection. The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection, even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis. This suggested that the protection conferred by N3 is in a dose and time-dependent manner.",

In our study, we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2-transgenic mice from being infected (Fig. 4) ; viral load from different tissues (CNS and muscle) of N3-treated hSCARB2-transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non-treated groups (Fig. 5-6 ). These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection. Indeed, several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71-induced immunopathogenesis [19, 32] . Clinical, radiological, and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [33] . Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [13, 15] . CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. After N3 treatment, reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed (Fig. 7, 8 , 9) . Moreover, similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN-c, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG. Beside EV71, coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury, and immune infiltration and reclamation [34, 35] . Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [36] .",

Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity. We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope (210-225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776-790 encoded residues of EV71 genome; [17] ). In comparison of the recent study [37] , alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid (200-225) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71, which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross-neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence. The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report's epitopes; the mouse anti-sera generated from the peptides, P230-323, P646-755, P857-1012 and P1329-1440, showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla.

In B4 challenge test, scoring of mice with HLS and HLP was performed. After the investigation or when weight loss of 20% occurred, tested animals were euthanasia by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation to minimize the animals suffering. To perform virus challenge, mice were explored in the anesthetic inhalator chamber containing isoflurane (For initial phase: 5%, for maintainced phase: 1.5%,2.5%) for 1 minutes before subcutaneously or intraperitoneally immunized with EV71 or antibody, respectively.",

RNAs were extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscle of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 6 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) CXCL10, (B) CCL3, and (C) IL-6. The number of PCR cycles (Ct) required for fluorescent detection of target genes was calculated and presented as the relative expression after normalization with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue. Each normalized 2 Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2 Ct obtained from the antibody-untreated tissues.
