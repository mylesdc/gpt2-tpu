The aim of this study was to identify enteric microorganisms involved in monoinfections and coinfections and the associated virulence factors in healthy and diarrheic foals. Diarrheic (D) ( = 56) and nondiarrheic (ND) foals ( = 60) up to three months of age were studied. Fecal samples were analyzed for identification of infectious agents (microbiological culturing, molecular techniques, and microscopic analyses). Escherichia coli fimH (30% versus 25%), Salmonella spp. (25% versus 7%), Strongyloides westeri (25% versus 25%), Clostridium perfringens type A (21% versus 10%), E. coli ag43 (20% versus 35%), Strongylus (11% versus 18%), and vapA-positive Rhodococcus equi (5% versus 2%) were the most frequent enteric pathogens detected in D and ND foals, respectively. The frequency of toxin A-positive C. perfringens was significantly increased in the D ( = 0.033) compared with the ND animals. R. equi strains harboring virulent plasmids were also identified (VapA 85-kb type I and VapA 87-kb type I) in D and ND foals. Coinfections were observed in 46% of the D and 33% of the ND foals. Our results demonstrate the great diversity of enteric pathogens, virulence factors, and coinfections involved in enteric infections of foals.",

Some studies of diarrhea in neonatal foals have focused on only one pathogen [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] although it is usually caused by diverse combinations of enteric infections [1, 5, 7, 12, 13] . The understanding of the prevalence and complexity of major pathogens associated with enteric infections in neonatal foals is limited [14] . Comprehensive studies have highlighted the impacts of enteric coinfections in foals with diarrhea and have identified major virulence factors of some pathogens in these infections [1, 5, 7, 13] . However, few studies have evaluated the normal microbial population of the equine intestine, particularly in foals [15] [16] [17] . Nondiarrheic foals have been suggested to be potential reservoirs of enteric pathogens, including agents with zoonotic potential [13, 18] . The aim of this study was to identify enteric microorganisms involved in monoinfections Table 1 : Distribution of total foals per farm; sampled foals with (56) and without diarrhea (60) (1-90) ND 13 10 3 0 (60-90) ND 14 11 3 \u2020 4 ( 1 -6 0 ) 1 ( 9 ) and coinfections and the associated virulence factors in healthy and diarrheic foals up to three months of age and to identify dehydration, alterations in the complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte abnormalities.",

Few studies have examined the role of beta-2 toxin as an additional virulence factor in C. perfringens infection in equines, and almost all of them have exclusively examined adult horses [50, 51] . Thus, the importance of beta-2 toxin in foals remains controversial [11] . A toxigenic C. difficile strain (A+B+CDT\u2212) was isolated from one diarrheic foal in this study; this was the only confirmed case of C. difficile infection in this study. However, C. difficile strains were isolated from three other animals. Among them, two strains were nontoxigenic (all from nondiarrheic animals), and one was toxigenic but was negative for the A/B toxins. The lack of detection of the A/B toxins in these three animals may indicate that they are asymptomatic carriers, which may be a common occurrence among foals [11, 45] .",

            "text": "Salmonellosis is certainly one of the most important zoonoses worldwide [18] . In equines, it has been identified as a prevalent causative agent of enteric and systemic infections [52] . A total of 18 Salmonella strains were isolated from foals up to 90 days of age in the current study. This result is consistent with those of other studies demonstrating that this pathogen is more prevalent in animals between 1 and 3 months of age [13, 52] . In the present study, 25% (14/56) of the Salmonella strains were isolated from diarrheic foals; this is considered a high frequency and is in agreement with the 8 BioMed Research International results of similar studies [13, 53] . Salmonella Typhimurium appears to be the most commonly reported pathogenic serotype in equines of different ages [46] . Over the last decades, Salmonella Typhimurium, Newport, Anatum, and Agona were the most frequent serotypes reported in the USA [52] . In addition, Salmonella Typhimurium, Newport and Glostrup were the main serotypes detected among diarrheic horses in Brazil [54] . In the current study, Salmonella Infantis, Typhimurium, and Saintpaul were the most prevalent serotypes recovered from the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. In addition, higher mortality of the Salmonella-infected foals compared with the non-Salmonella-infected foals was observed in the present study. E. coli was isolated alone or together with other pathogens at a high frequency in both the diarrheic or nondiarrheic foals. This result is not surprising because this organism is part of the normal enteric microflora of livestock [4] . Despite the recognized pathogenicity of E. coli to humans [18] and livestock [4] the major virulence factors of E. coli involved in enteric infections of foals remain unclear [4] . Selected virulence factors of E. coli were assessed in 99 E. coli strains from the foals; three strains from diarrheic foals were positive for Shiga-like toxin genes and another isolate was positive for STb and LT, whereas one strain from a nondiarrheic foal was positive for STb. In addition, eight isolates from diarrheic foals were positive for the eae gene. These findings demonstrate the presence of potentially virulent strains [40] . In the current study, the absence of F4 (k88), F5 (k99), and F41 fimbriae and LT, STa, and STb enterotoxins among the E. coli strains isolated from diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals indicates that this organism has little influence on the pathogenicity of enteric infections in neonatal foals, despite the fact that F4 and F5 fimbriae are classically involved in enterotoxigenic infections in calves and pigs and have been identified sporadically [2] or at low levels in enteric infections of foals [40] . Other virulence factors related to enteric and/or extraenteric infections in domestic animals, such as the cnf-1 and cnf-2 cytotoxins, papG, sfaC/D, and afaB/C fimbriae and iucD (aerobactin) and hly genes [28] , were not detected in the 32 E. coli strains assessed in this study, indicating that E. coli may not be a typical primary agent of colitis or enterocolitis in foals [17] . Despite the apparent lack of an association with the occurrence of diarrhea in foals, detection of the fimH gene simultaneously in strains recovered from feces and from urinary tract infections in other domestic animals [28] demonstrates the uropathogenic potential of fecal E. coli strains obtained from foals.",

The ag43 gene (antigen 43) has been recently demonstrated to encode an abundant outer membrane protein in E. coli [55] .

The 85kb type II plasmid has been observed in animals in France, whereas the 85-kb III and IV plasmids have been encountered in animals in the USA [55, [58] [59] [60] . Another finding with relevance in the current study was the detection of three VapApositive R. equi strains in diarrheic foals between 30 and 60 days of age; two of these strains had the 85-kb type I and 87kb type I plasmids. Interestingly, the same virulent plasmid types have been previously described in 41 R. equi strains isolated from foals in Brazil; 33 of these strains had the 87kb type I plasmid, and six contained the 85-kb type I plasmid, whereas the remaining two possessed a proposed new variant [59] . Our results confirm that the VapA 85-kb type I and 87kb type I plasmids are most frequently present in virulent R. equi strains in foals from Brazil, and they reinforce the role of feces as a route of elimination of pathogenic R. equi in foals.

C. parvum has been identified at a high frequency (25%) in diarrheic foals in Trinidad, although a significantly higher frequency has been detected in nondiarrheic animals [13] . In contrast, only 4% of the foals sampled in our study tested positive for C. parvum, including three with diarrhea and two without enteric signs. Another enteric protozoan pathogen, Giardia duodenalis (syn. Giardia intestinalis, Giardia lamblia), assemblage A, is considered the causative agent of diarrhea in many companion animals, livestock, wildlife species, and humans [18, 65] . However, few studies have investigated enteric infections by Giardia intestinalis and other parasite species in equines [52] . Similar to C. parvum, G. duodenalis was identified by molecular techniques in a small proportion (2%) of the analyzed stool samples from the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals in the current study, indicating the limited involvement of this protozoan pathogen in enteric infections in the studied region.",

Considerable variations in the frequencies of the major enteric pathogens recovered from diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals worldwide have been reported in different studies [1, 6, 7, 13] . Moreover, many studies have focused on only one enteric pathogen [8, 9, 9, 10, 12, 40, 63, 64] , despite the recognized etiological complexity and the potential combinations of pathogens in equine enteric infections [13, 52] . Notably, a large number of enteric pathogens of bacterial, viral, and parasitic origins, as well as diverse coinfections, have been identified in diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. In fact, substantial etiological complexity of enteric organisms has been observed among foals, reinforcing the necessity to include major enteropathogens in the differential diagnosis of neonatal enteric infections in these animals [1, 7, 17] . The failure to identify significant differences in the frequencies of pathogens between diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals in the current study, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens toxin A+, has also been reported previously [6, 66] , indicating that other factors, such as age, the nutrition and immune statuses, environmental conditions, general management practices, and characteristics of the farm facilities, may influence the occurrence of clinical cases of diarrhea [4] .",
