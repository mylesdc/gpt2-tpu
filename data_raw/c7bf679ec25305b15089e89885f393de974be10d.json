            "text": "Background: Early detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of swine is necessary to control this devastating disease. By monitoring host serum antibodies to viral antigens, early virus detection within herds is feasible. In this study, recombinant antigens were generated using recombinant DNA techniques to fuse PRRSV structural protein (N) or nonstructural protein 1\u03b1 (nsp1\u03b1) with the Rellina luciferase gene. Next, fused genes were cloned into plasmids and transfected into HEK-293 T cells for transient expression. Upon coincubation of lysates with pig sera, antigen-antibody complexes formed that bound to Protein-G coated onto microplates. By further measurement of luminance value, a modified form of Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems, namely luciferase-linked antibody capture assay (LACA) was developed for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies. Results: Known anti-PRRSV antibody-positive or -negative serum samples (125 and 122 samples, respectively) were used to validate the LACA and compared it with IDEXX PRRS \u00d73 ELISA. Based on the result, N-Rluc and nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA results were 95.3 and 94.4% in agreement with IDEXX ELISA, suggested a similar specificity of LACA to IDEXX ELISA. Moreover, when both LACA and IDEXX ELISA were used to evaluate sequential serum samples obtained from PRRSV experimentally infected pigs, the PRRSV-specific antibody response was detectable as early as 3 days postinoculation (dpi) using N-Rluc LACA, but undetectable until 7 dpi using IDEXX ELISA, suggesting an improved sensitivity of LACA. Meanwhile, antibodies specific for nsp1\u03b1 were detected at higher levels overall, but were undetectable until 10 dpi. Furthermore,. Notably, one IDEXX ELISA positive result was not confirmed by LACA or IFA and was thus considered a false-positive result. Conclusion: The LACA exhibited similar specificity but improved sensitivity to that of the commercial IDEXX PRRS \u00d73 ELISA kit for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies in pig serum. Importantly, LACA could be adapted for detecting antibodies against other PRRSV targets, such as nsp1\u03b1, to achieve earlier detection of PRRSV infection.",

However, multiple methods have been established to detect PRRSV specific antibody as a serological marker for PRRSV infection, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and immunofluorescence and immunochromatographic strip -based assays [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Generally, PRRSV-specific Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear typically after 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) [1, 10] , but non-protective antibodies produced within the first week post-infection may be more useful for early detection of PRRSV infection. These early antibodies include non-neutralizing antibodies specific for structural proteins such as PRRSV N protein or nsps [1, 11] ; N protein and certain nonstructural proteins (nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7) have been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic [12, 13] . Indeed, most currently available commercial ELISA kits that detect PRRSV-specific antibodies (e.g., IDEXX Herd-Chek PRRS ELISA) employ anti-N antibody as a serological marker for PRRSV infection or Modified Live Virus (MLV) immunization status [1] .",

            "text": "Although commercial tests such as ELISA are highly sensitive for determining the presence of PRRSV-specific antibodies in serum samples, ELISAs are not suitable for quantitative analysis of antibody levels. This shortcoming is due to the fact that OD values obtained from ELISAs usually vary within a narrow range (from 0.1 to 2). Moreover, most ELISA kits use prokaryotically expressed single recombinant PRRSV structural antigens (generally PRRSV-N protein) as coating antigens. Consequently, such systems cannot evaluate PRRSV-specific antibody responses against other PRRSV enveloped proteins or nonstructural proteins (nsps). It should be noted here that systems employing multiple PRRSV antigens will probably not be developed due to the tremendous effort required for expression and purification of multiple ELISA plate coating antigens. Moreover, due to the general nature of ELISA coating antigens expressed in E. coli, false positive or false negative results have been frequently reported [12, 14] . Therefore, development of an improved method for both accurate detection and quantification of PRRSV specific antibodies is urgently needed.",

Similar to LIPS, LACA utilizes the enzymatic activity from captured luciferase-fused antigen-antibody complexes to convert a substrate to luminescent form to quantify antibody levels indirectly [15, 16] . As an immunoprecipitation assay, LIPS was originally developed by Dr. Peter D. Burbelo from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

These validated samples were used to determine the cutoff value of LACA. An optimized cutoff value that maximized assay efficiency was demonstrated for an S/N ratio of 1.4608 for N-Rluc LACA and an S/N ratio of 1.7537 for nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA ( Fig. 3a and b,  respectively) . As shown in Table 2 , diagnostic sensitivity rates of 98.4% vs. 93.6% were observed (95% confidence interval, 94.3-99.8% vs. 87.8-97.2%) for N-Rluc LACA and nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA, respectively. Moreover, diagnostic specificity rates of 100% vs.100% (95% confidence interval, 97.0-100% vs. 97.0-100%) for N-Rluc LACA and nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA were observed as well, indicating that the specificity of N-Rluc LACA was comparable to that of nsp1a-Rluc LACA (p = 0.7870) ( Table 3) . With regard to repeatability, N-Rluc LACA and nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA were analyzed to determine their potential value for diagnostic applications, while the levels of precision of both LACA systems were compared using antibody-negative internal control sera. The N-Rluc LACA intra-plate %CV was 9.79 and the %CV between runs was 6.26, while the nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA intra-plate %CV was 8.72 and the %CV between runs was 8.98 (Table 4) .",

Among the 6 pigs, sequential samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10 14, 21 and 28 dpi and for 4 pigs sequential samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 dpi (Fig. 4a) . Based on our results of the N-Rluc LACA, serum samples from two infected pigs (33.33%) were identified as anti-PRRSV antibody-positive as early as 3 dpi and serum samples from five pigs (83.33%) were positive at 7 dpi. All sera collected at 10 dpi were positive using N-Rluc LACA (Fig. 4a) . For the nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA, PRRSV-specific antibodies were not detected before 7 dpi. However, all serum samples tested positive at 10 dpi and thereafter (Fig. 4b) . Meanwhile, all serum samples analyzed by IDEXX ELISA were anti-PRRSV antibody-negative at 3 dpi but tested antibody-positive at 7 dpi (Fig. 4c) . Taken together, it appears that the N-Rluc LACA demonstrated superior sensitivity for early PRRSV detection (3 dpi) when compared to nsp1-Rluc LACA and IDEXX ELISA.",

On the one hand, the LIPS assay requires skilled technicians to conducted complicated immunoprecipitation (IP) procedures. On the other hand, LIPS requires immobilized protein G or A beads (agarose or magnetic beads conjugated to Protein G or A) which are less cost-effective for large scale screening beyond academic research. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , LACA is a protocol that shares major steps with ELISA, including incubation and well washes, with comparable total times for both assays. However, the two types of assay differ in reporter enzymes used (HRP for ELISA, luciferase for LACA), substrates (TMB for ELISA, luciferin for LACA), antigens (plate-coated antigen for ELISA, cell lysates for LACA) and opacity of plates (transparent for ELISA, black for LACA). Advantages of LACA over ELISA include the fact that luciferase-linked viral antigens used in LACA can be directly obtained from lysates of plasmid-transfected cells without requiring purification procedures [33] [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, luciferase activity in LACA generates highly quantitative data spanning a relatively wider range of values (from 10 3 to 10 6 ) than for ELISA, which is more suitable for evaluating dynamic changes in antibody responses against a specific antigen over time.",

In our study, the PRRSV-specific antibody response could be measured as early as 3 dpi by N-Rluc LACA, but not by IDEXX ELISA for the same panel of sequential serum samples. These results therefore indicate greater analytical sensitivity of the LACA than of ELISA, perhaps due to LACA detection of swine anti-N IgM; because no N-specific IgG would be expected to be produced by 3 dpi, it is possible that the Protein G coating used in the LACA could capture N-specific IgM or other N-specific antibody types from swine sera. Nevertheless, the maximal level of antibody detected at 14 dpi by N-Rluc LACA was quite similar to that analyzed by IDEXX ELISA. As noted a decade ago, humoral immune responses against PRRSV infection are not restricted to PRRSV structural proteins, since antibodies recognizing nsps were detected as early as one week after PRRSV infection [1] with certain nonstructural proteins (nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7) highly immunogenic [13] . Since nsp1\u03b1 is both the first nsp produced post-infection and the first viral protein synthesized during PRRSV replication in cells, we also tested Renilla luciferase-fused nsp1\u03b1 as an alternative antigen for LACA. Based on our results, the earliest detection of PRRSV-specific antibody was observed at 10 dpi for nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA, with a longer duration of antibody detection that peaked at 21 dpi and remained high at 28 dpi (the end time point of the experiment).",

On the one hand, since the luciferase-fused PRRSV antigens used in this study (both N and nsp1\u03b1) were each derived from a single PRRSV strain (SD16 for N and HuN4 for nsp1\u03b1), it is possible that PRRSV strains circulating within the swine herd possessed corresponding proteins with different antigenic determinants, resulting in false negative results.
