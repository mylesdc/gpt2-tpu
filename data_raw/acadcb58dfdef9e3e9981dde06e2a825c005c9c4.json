            "text": "The replication enzyme of RNA viruses must preferentially recognize their RNAs in an environment that contains an abundance of cellular RNAs. The factors responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified cellular membrane compartments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells. This work demonstrates that the specific recognition of the norovirus subgenomic promoter is through binding by the viral RdRp.",

The majority of noroviruses express three conserved open reading frames named ORF1-3 while MNV has an additional ORF4 (12, 13) . ORF1 encodes a polyprotein which is processed by proteolysis to generate six non-structural (NS) proteins that replicate and transcribe the viral genome. These include NS7, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (14) . ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and the minor capsid proteins, respectively. ORF4 of MNV is translated from an alternative reading frame within ORF2 to produce virulence factor 1 that targets innate immune responses (13) . The proteins from ORF1 are translated from the norovirus genomic RNA. The proteins from ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4 are translated from one polyadenylated RNA of ca. 2.5 kb in length, the subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (12, 13) .",

In agreement with this model, a highly conserved RNA stem-loop structure upstream of the start site of the sgRNA initiation nucleotide was identified in all caliciviruses. Mutations in this RNA structure will debilitate MNV sgRNA synthesis and suppressor mutations that restored the RNA structure were found to restore MNV infectivity (23, 24) .",

            "text": "We hypothesized that the norovirus RdRp is the component in the replicase complex that recognizes core promoters for sgRNA viral RNA synthesis. Recombinant viral RdRps can typically use a wide variety of RNA templates for RNA synthesis and hence, have not been thought to specifically recognize viral promoter elements except for the initiation nucleotide (30, 31) . Five RNA promoter/templates were designed to examine specificity for RNA synthesis (Figure 1A) . Three of the RNAs contained viral subgenomic core promoters followed by short template sequences. For brevity, these RNAs are referred to as 'proscripts'. The MNV, human norovirus GII.4, and the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) proscripts are, respectively, named Mps, Gps and Hps ( Figure 1A ). The remaining two RNAs, PE19 and PE46, do not contain promoter sequences, but were previously used for, respectively, de novo initiated and primerdependent RNA synthesis by the Hepatitis C virus RdRp (32) . The structures of the MNV and GII.4 subgenomic hairpin are conserved and the base pairing in the MNV hairpin has been shown to be required for efficient MNV infection (24) . The computer program Mfold also shows that the hairpin structure is the thermodynamically most stable in the context of the proscript RNAs (data not shown). However, to determine whether the MNV and GII.4 proscripts will form one predominant RNA structure in solution, we analyzed the RNAs using denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This analysis was previously used to characterize the suitability of the RNAs for NMR spectroscopy (33, 34) . In the denaturing gels, all of the RNAs migrated at their expected lengths ( Figure 1B ). In the nondenaturing gels, the RNAs also formed one band, suggesting that Mps and Gps form one predominant RNA structure in solution ( Figure 1B ). RNAs Mhp and Ghp that contain the hairpin structures also formed one predominant structure in solution ( Figure 1B ).",

To confirm that the MNV RdRp can accurately initiate RNA synthesis from the T + 1 cytidylate, we used proscript MpsIM, which has the same sequence as Mps except for an adenylate substitution at the T + 1 position.

The resulting fluorescence polarization data were plotted against the RNA concentration and the data were fitted to a Hill equation, yielding the values of IC 50 for Mps and Mhp of 2.36 and 16.2 M, respectively ( Figure 2C ).

This indicates that the GII.4 RdRp strongly prefers its own single-stranded sequence. The GII.4 RdRp also produced more de novo initiated RNA from C2 when compared to Mps (20 versus 8; Figure 3C ), consis- With the MNV RdRp, C2 directed only 17% of the product relative to the amount from Mps. Given that Mps and C2 have identical single-stranded sequences, the reduced level of RNA synthesis demonstrates that the MNV Sg hairpin is needed for efficient RNA synthesis ( Figure 2D and E) . C2 directed the MNV RdRp to produce similar amounts of de novo initiated RNA when compared to Gps (17 versus 15; Figure 3C ). Given that C2 and Gps share the same hairpin sequence but differ in their single-stranded sequences, the MNV RdRp has more flexible recognition of the singlestranded sequence than does the GII.4 RdRp. Thus, although the MNV RdRp preferentially recognizes its own subgenomic proscript, it has lower specificity for both the hairpin and the single-stranded RNA sequence when compared to the GII.4 RdRp. This lower specificity likely accounts for the higher level of promiscuous RNA synthesis from the Gps by the MNV RdRp.",

Given that the MNV system offers greater flexibility for genetic manipulation than the human norovirus, we focused this mapping effort on the MNV RdRp despite its reduced specificity for its proscript. The mapping studies used the RCAP protocol, which combines reversible crosslinking and peptide mass fingerprinting to identify peptide sequences within the RdRp that can crosslink to the viral RNA ( Figure 4A) . Briefly, the RNAs and RdRp were crosslinked with formaldehyde, followed by extensive digestion of the complex with trypsin. The RNAs and peptides associated with RNA were precipitated with LiCl and the crosslinks reversed by heating. MALDI-ToF/MS was then used to identify the RNA-associated peptides. Control reactions that contained the MNV RdRp treated with formaldehyde in the absence of RNA, or the RdRp-RNA complex that were not crosslinked with formaldehyde did not yield signals above background. However, 17 peptides derived from the MNV RdRp were identified to be associated with Mps, and 11 with Mhp ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Within each data set, several peptides had overlapping sequences due to missed cleavages by trypsin, which is expected to occur when an arginine or lysine residue is crosslinked to the RNA. Eight of the 17 MNV RdRp peptides identified to associate with Mps, only 8 represent unique regions in the RdRp. In addition, all the peptides identified as associated with Mhp were also present in reactions performed with the MNV RdRp and Mps. This should be expected, given that Mps contains the hairpin that is Mph. To visualize the locations of these peptides, we mapped these peptides on the MNV-1 RdRp crystral structure (PDB: 3QID) (39) ( Figure 4C) . Notably, the majority of the cross-linked peptides are located in the central cavity of the MNV RdRp, where RNA synthesis occurs.",

Three versions of Mhp were chemically synthesized to each contain 4SU at residues 2, 15 or 24 to generate RNAs named, respectively, 2-4SU, 15-4SU, and 24-4SU ( Figure 5A ). In vitro RNA synthesis assays confirmed that the three RNAs inhibited RNA synthesis from Mps to the same degree as the unmodified Mhp (Supplementary Figure S2) . Following crosslinking to MNV RdRp and trypsin digestion, the peptide-RNA complexes were precipitated with LiCl. The RNAs in the complexes were then thoroughly digested to release nucleotides from the peptides, leaving only the crosslinked nucleotide. The identities of the cross-linked peptides were then determined by high-resolution and collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra using the LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. Kramer et al. have shown that crosslinking of proteins and 4SU substituted RNAs could undergo the loss of H 2 S, the loss of the double bond in 4SU, and the loss of phosphates from either or both the 3 or the 5 positions (45) . All of these structural possibilities were considered during analysis of the Orbitrap mass spectra for the crosslinking reactions between the MNV RdRp protein and the modified RNAs. Three different peptides having one or more 4SU molecules attached to either arginine or lysine residues were identified from the reactions of RdRp with the modified RNAs. The sequence LDRASIDRQLLWTK from residues 409-422 was identified with certainty to bind 15-4SU ( Figure 5B ). CID data indicated that 15-4SU crosslinked to R411 and R416 side chains and resulted in the loss of its sulfur atom as shown in Figure 5C . Two additional peptides KRLLWGSDLGTMIR (residues 184-197; crosslinked arginine underlined) and WDSTQQRAILK (residues 249-259, crosslinked arginine and lysine underlined) were identified to bind 24-4SU and 2-4SU, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3) . However, some signals for both peptides were also observed with 2-SU and 24-4SU, suggesting that the bulged region in the hairpin and the base of the hairpin RNA could contact the RdRp at two different locations. The three 4SU cross-linked peptides identified here were also identified in the RCAP assay discussed previously (Figure 4 ). The locations of the five cross-linked residues are shown in the model of the MNV RdRp in Figure 5D .",

Mutant R416A did produce more products when tested at higher concentrations, but both primer extension and de novo initiation remained sharply reduced compared to that of WT RdRp. Surprisingly, of the two major de novo initiated RNA products made by R416A, the product prematurely terminated by 1-nt was more abundant than the full-length product ( Figure 6C ).

Furthermore, the RdRp sequence alignment shows the GII.4 RdRp has a glutamine at position 408 and an alanine at position 256, which is comparable to R411 and K259 of the MNV RdRp ( Figure 5E ). These observations led us to determine whether GII.4 RdRp with substitutions of Q408R, A256K or both could improve de novo RNA synthesis with the heterologous MNV proscript. All three mutant RdRps produced comparable amounts of product from Gps when compared to the WT GII.4, indicating no loss of specificity for their cognate proscript ( Figure 7A and B). In comparison to the WT MNV RdRp, the mutants directed much lower levels of de novo initiation of the 11-nt RNA from Mps. However, an approximately 2-fold increase was observed with the Q408R and the Q408R/A256K mutant proteins in comparison to the WT GII.4 RdRp ( Figure 7C ). Although the increase in RNA synthesis is modest, the results are reproducible in three independent assays. These results support the previous data suggesting that residue R411 in the MNV RdRp is important in directing de novo-initiated RNA synthesis by the MNV RdRp from the subgenomic core promoter. This data also suggests that GII.4 RdRp has additional requirements for the recognition of its subgenomic proscript than does the MNV RdRp.",

In addition to the RNA hairpin motif, our results also show the single-stranded sequence that contains the template initiation nucleotide can significantly influence proscript recognition ( Figure 2C ). There is also precedent for unstructured sequence modulating the level of RNA synthesis (30, 46, (54) (55) . Butcher et al. (56) have identified various specific contacts between the template RNA and the phage 6 RdRp during de novo initiated RNA synthesis. This level of specificity for the template sequence could prevent the viral replication complex from misrecognition of the RNAs which could lead to defects in the process of RNA synthesis and possibly increase the detection of the RNA products by innate immune receptors (57) .",

It is worth noting that core promoter recognition by the recombinant norovirus RdRps is a feature shared with bacteriophage DNAdependent RNA polymerases (37, (58) (59) . Iyer et al. (60) had proposed that the ancestor of the RNA polymerases contains an RNA-binding domain that preceded the acquisition of polymerase activity. Higher resolution analysis of the interactions between the norovirus RdRps and their cognate promoters would therefore provide insight to potentially ancient protein-RNA interaction as well as inform the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis.",

Hps; predicted secondary structure of the HEV genotype 3 Kernow C1 isolate (JQ679013), nt 5317 to 5361. (B) The RNAs used for RNA synthesis exist in one predominant conformation in solution. The upper gel image shows the RNAs used in the analysis in this manuscript separated in a 15% polyacrylamide gel amended with 7.5 M urea. The bottom gel image contains RNAs separated in a 15% polyacrylamide gel that lacks urea. The RNAs were stained with toluidine blue. (C) RNA products made by the RdRps from the GII.4 human norovirus, MNV, and the HCV. Products correctly initiated by a de novo mechanism and terminated after the 3 terminus of the template are identified by asterisks. The gel image was obtained using a Phosphorimager of a 24% polyacrylamide gel that contains 7.5 M urea. The lengths of the de novo initiated RNAs were derived from previous analyses where the MNV RdRp products were electrophoresed along with products of known lengths. (D) Proscripts with substitutions of the T + 1 cytidylate are unable to direct de novo initiation of RNA products by the MNV and the GII.4 RdRps. The products of primer extension (PE) and de novo initiation (DN) are shown. The RNAs that are correctly initiated and terminated from Mps and Gps are, respectively, 11-and 8-nt.",
