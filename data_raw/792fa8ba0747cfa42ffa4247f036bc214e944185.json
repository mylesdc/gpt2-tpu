            "text": "Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1-4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1-4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template. Viruses 2017, 9, 292 2 of 18 polymerase [9-16]. All members of the alphavirus-like superfamily share capping, helicase, and polymerase domains in their replicase proteins [2].",

Alphaviruses form spherules at the plasma membrane, and CHIKV and Sindbis virus (SINV) spherules predominantly stay at the plasma membrane, while Semliki Forest virus (SFV) spherules are internalized to endoand lysosomal membranes [18] [19] [20] .",

It has been shown that the template's length determines SFV spherule size [22] , and the current view is that the minus-strand RNA synthesized from the genomic template is inside the mature spherule as part of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that form the replicative intermediates, and newly made plus strands are released into the cytoplasm [23] [24] [25] .",

The replicase proteins are expressed from one or several plasmids together with a separate plasmid that expresses a template RNA that can be replicated in trans. However, active replication is achieved only when plus-stranded RNA is expressed as a template. This indicates that replication cannot initiate from a single-stranded minus strand as a template, but rather requires a dsRNA intermediate for plus-strand synthesis [27, 30] . Furthermore, it has been recently shown that a partially uncleaved alphavirus replicase can form spherules in the absence of the RNA template [29] . The template-independent spherule formation requires a combination of the uncleaved P123 and nsP4 or nsP1, or uncleaved P23 and nsP4. Furthermore, even a polymerase mutant (nsP4 GAA ) with its active site Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) mutated to Gly-Ala-Ala (GAA) causes spherule formation when co-expressed with P123 or nsP1 and P23. Spherule morphology in the absence of the template is, however, more irregular compared to those formed during normal replication, confirming the idea that the template plays a central role in size determination.",

            "text": "Positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses are the most common type of RNA viruses, and include numerous human pathogens [1] . The recent re-emergence and outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) highlight the medical significance of alphaviruses, which belong to the alphavirus-like superfamily containing several families of +RNA viruses from animals or plants [2] [3] [4] . Alphaviruses form the family Togaviridae together with the rubella virus, and they are mainly arthropod-borne viruses that infect vertebrates. The alphavirus genome of about 11-12 kb contains a 5\u2032 cap and encodes two polyproteins. The P1234 polyprotein is processed into four nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1-4, and the structural polyprotein, translated from a subgenomic RNA, is cleaved to yield the capsid and envelope proteins [5] . All four nsPs are required for viral RNA synthesis [6] [7] [8] , and they form a membrane-associated replication complex (RC). nsP1 is the RNA-capping enzyme and the only viral protein responsible for anchoring the RC to membranes; nsP2 is the helicase and protease; nsP3 interacts with several host factors; and nsP4 is the core RNA-dependent RNA T7 RNA polymerase [34] , were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% (v/v) Difco tryptose phosphate broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1 mg/mL G418 (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin (Gibco). Both cell lines were grown at 37 \u00b0C and in 5% CO2. Virus-infected or transfected cells were grown in the same conditions. All virus and plasmid constructs used in this study contain a hemagglutinin (HA) peptide (YPYDVPDYA) in a frame within nsP3. For generation of SFV4-HA virus, the oligos encoding the HA-tag and flanking glycines were 5\u2032-TCGAGGGCTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTG GTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCGACACCAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGCCC-3\u2032. Oligos were annealed, phosphorylated, and cloned into the XhoI site of replicon pSFV1-ZsG, removing the ZsGreen gene [18] . A larger piece containing the HA-insert was then transferred with SacI and NotI to pCMV-SFV4 [35] . The virus stocks were produced by transfecting ~3 \u00d7 10 6 BHK-21 cells with 2.5 \u00b5g of pCMV-SFV4-HA using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 16-18 h incubation in minimum essential medium (MEM; Gibco) containing 0.2% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM L-glutamine, the supernatant was collected. This primary stock was used to infect BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in MEM containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM L-glutamine. After 1 h, cells were washed twice and new medium was added. The supernatant designated as secondary stock was collected after 16-18 h post infection (p.i.). Titers were quantified by plaque assay titration [36] .",

The rate of 3 H-uridine incorporation into viral RNA reached a maximum level at 4-5 h.p.i. Thus, SFV-infected cells were harvested at 4 h.p.i. and homogenized in isotonic buffer to prepare PNS. Typically, the PNS samples had a total protein concentration of ~3 mg/mL. To further isolate the RCs, PNS was separated into a P15 pellet and S15 supernatant by differential centrifugation at 15,000\u00d7 g, and the distribution of viral nsPs as well as RNA was studied. The cytosolic marker \u03b2-actin and 18S rRNA were predominantly found in the S15 fractions ( Figure  1C ,D).

No labeled RNA was detected in the mock PNS, while the PNS prepared from SFV-infected cells synthesized three RNA species corresponding to SFV genomic and subgenomic RNA, as well as an RNA species designated as RNA II, in line with other alphaviruses [25, 33] . The genomic RNA was the major product synthesized in vitro, and RNA II was only detected in the 32 P-labeled reaction products of the in vitro assay, not in the 3 H-uridine-labeled viral RNA synthesized in cells ( Figure 1A ,E). This might be due to the short half-life of RNA II in the infected cells or due to the lack of sensitivity in detecting 3 H-labeled RNA compared to 32 P-labeled molecules. Approximately 9% and 49% of the in vitro replication activity present in the PNS was recovered in the S15 and P15 fractions, respectively ( Figure 1E ). The membrane fraction prepared from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-infected cells is inactive in replication in vitro unless a cytosolic fraction is added in the reaction mixture [42] . However, mixing of the S15 and P15 did not restore the full replication activity of SFV (69% of that in the PNS), indicating that the factors in the S15 fraction are dispensable for replication and that the differential centrifugation likely caused damage to RCs, leading to a partial loss of activity. The slight boost after mixing P15 and S15 was most likely due to the cellular NTP pool present in S15.",

The wild-type replicase polyprotein, P1234, as well as the polymerase inactive mutant, P1234 GAA , were included in this study. In addition, two partially uncleaved polyproteins were used. In P1^2^34, cleavage sites between nsP1 and nsP2 as well as nsP2 and nsP3 have been mutated, resulting in the polyprotein P123 and nsP4. In P12 CA 3, the active site of the nsP2 protease has been mutated, and nsP4 is expressed from a separate plasmid as an ubiquitin-nsP4 fusion. The Tmed plasmid that expresses a 2963-nt RNA containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) and the subgenomic promoter was provided as a template plasmid [26] .

After an in vitro replication assay (IVRA), RNA was analysed in a denaturing agarose gel. P+S indicates a mixture of equal volumes of P15 and S15 from SFV-infected cells. The results of the fractionation of transfected-cell PNS into S15 and P15 were also comparable to those obtained with virus-infected cells, as \u03b2-actin and 18S rRNA were mostly found in the S15 fractions (Figures 2 and 3) . nsP4 was enriched in P15 (~50-70%), except in P1234 GAA , where the majority of nsP4 was found in S15 (~80%). The P15 fraction of the cleavable constructs, P1234 and P1234 GAA , contained the majority of nsP1 (~90 and 80%, respectively). Approximately 30% and 20% of nsP2 and ~50 and 40% of nsP3 were found in P15 of P1234 and P1234 GAA , respectively. The polyprotein P123 was detected when cells were transfected with the uncleavable constructs, P1^2^34 or P12 CA 3, and the majority was distributed in P15 (~80 and 90%, respectively). Besides the polyprotein P123, bands recognized by anti-nsP1 and anti-nsP2 antibodies were detected in these samples. Their size was slightly smaller compared to nsP1 and nsP2 in the cleavable constructs, and thus they most likely represent unspecific cleavage products. Approximately 90% of the band detected by the anti-nsP1 antibody was found in P15. However, the unspecific cleavage product of nsP2 was also mainly found in the membrane fraction (~80%) in contrast to nsP2 in cells infected with SFV or transfected with the wild-type replicase, in which the majority of nsP2 was recovered in the cytosolic fraction (Figures 1 and 2) . No processed nsP3 was observed in cells transfected with the uncleavable constructs, which may be due to its instability and rapid turn-over. The only major difference observed between cells transfected with the two uncleavable constructs was that the P12 CA 3 + nsP4-transfected cells contained more nsP4, most likely due to its expression from a separate plasmid. was prepared and fractionated into P15 and S15, and nsPs were detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies. The polyprotein P123 was recognized using anti-nsP3 antibody. \u03b2-actin was used as a cytosolic marker. Equivalent amounts of PNS, P15, and S15 were loaded. Two independent experiments were performed and one representative result is shown here.",

No signal was detected when RNA from mock-transfected or P1234 GAA + Tmed-transfected cells was analysed by in-gel hybridizations with probes specific for the template RNA ( Figure 3A ). Both minus-and plus-strand RNA were detected in PNS when the wild-type replicase and uncleavable constructs together with the template were expressed ( Figure 3A) . Cells expressing the uncleavable construct P1^2^34 + Tmed contained a considerably higher amount of the minus-strand RNA compared to those expressing the wild-type construct P1234 + Tmed. Cells transfected with the wild-type replicase and Tmed contained significantly higher amounts of the genomic and subgenomic plus strands when compared to the uncleavable replicase ( Figure 3A) . In both cases, the S15 fraction contained more plus-strand RNA, while the minus-strand RNA was distributed more evenly. Thus, it was studied if the minus-strand RNA is in a nuclease-protected form in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions. PNS, P15, and S15 fractions from P1^2^34 + Tmed were treated with RNase A/T1 under low salt conditions to digest both single-and double-stranded RNA. The digestion of 18S rRNA was observed in all treated samples, confirming that the RNase treatment was effective ( Figure 3B ). More minus-strand RNA was digested in PNS and S15 than in P15, but all fractions contained at least 80% of the minus-strand RNA present in their corresponding untreated sample ( Figure 3B ). This indicates that the minus-strand RNA was mostly protected from the nucleases and not in a freely accessible form. Furthermore, most of the plus-strand RNA present in the PNS and S15 was digested, while in P15 the plus-strand RNA was protected. This confirms the idea that the plus-strands in replicative intermediates within the RC are membrane-protected, while they are released from the RCs into the cytosol in a more nuclease-sensitive form ( Figure 3B ).",

PNS from both mock-transfected cells and those transfected with the inactive polymerase mutant (P1234 GAA + Tmed) gave some background, most likely from the T7 polymerase that is expressed in BSR cells (Figure 4) . However, the wild-type replicase with the template was highly active in synthesizing both genomic and subgenomic RNA. RNA II was not observed, which may be due to its short half-life in combination with a lower activity of the RCs from transfected cells compared to those from infected cells. The P15 and S15 fractions prepared from cells transfected with P1234 + Tmed contained 38% and 15% of the replication activity present in the PNS, respectively (Figure 4) . A combination of P15 and S15 gave a yield of 53%. In contrast to the wild-type replicase, the uncleavable constructs P1^2^34 and P12 CA 3 + nsP4 replicated the endogenous template poorly, although they produced RNA species with sizes corresponding to both genomic and subgenomic Tmed. However, the smaller RNA species was detected in the polymerase mutant as well and thus might be the result of another (background) activity. In addition, an unspecific product was observed in all constructs with a size below that of the subgenomic RNA. The higher expression levels of nsP4 most likely explain why P12 CA 3 + nsP4 produced more labeled RNA than P1^2^34 (Figures 2 and 4) . .

These RNA species were compared to in vitro transcripts of SFV or Tmed of positive or negative polarity. Some 32 P-labeled IVRA products were denatured and hybridized with membrane-immobilized capture probes specific to positive or negative polarity SFV RNA. A capture probe corresponding to 1-2042 nt of EAV genome was used as a (negative) control for binding specificity. The IVRA products synthesized by SFV RCs strongly hybridized with the capture probe for the plus-strand RNA, indicating that SFV RCs mainly produced RNA of positive polarity in vitro ( Figure 5A ). Capture probes specific to the Tmed template of the trans-replication system gave more background, and thus the signal was quantified ( Figure 5B ,C). The IVRA products made by RCs from P1234 + Tmed-transfected cells showed similar binding to the capture probes as the plus-strand RNA transcript of Tmed. The RNA products synthesized by RCs formed upon expression of P1^2^34 + Tmed also produced a similar binding pattern as the plus-strand RNA transcript. The IVRA products made by P1234 GAA + Tmed showed significant binding only to the plus-RNA capture probe and the binding was approximately 67% of the binding to the plus-RNA capture probe detected with P1^2^34 + Tmed, suggesting that the signal generated by this uncleavable replicase was mostly or in part due to some background activity. As a negative control, an unrelated transcript (equine arteritis virus (EAV)) was also immobilized. The membranes were then hybridized with 32 P-labeled SFV transcripts of positive or negative polarity as well as 32 P-labeled IVRA products. IVRA reactions with PNS samples from mock and SFV-infected cells were included; (B) RNA probes with the plus sequence of Tmed, recognizing minus-strand RNA (RNA\u2212), or its complementary sequence, recognizing plus-strand RNA (RNA+), were immobilized on membranes as well as EAV transcript followed by hybridization with 32 P-labeled Tmed plus and minus transcripts as well as 32 P-labeled IVRA products. PNS samples from both mock and transfected cells were included; (C) binding of Tmed plus and minus transcripts as well as IVRA products to the capture probes was quantified from two independent experiments.

            "text": "To determine if in vitro RNA synthesizing activity requires ongoing protein synthesis (which might result in the de novo formation of complexes) we studied the effect of translation inhibitors. We first established whether translation occurred when PNS samples were incubated under IVRA conditions by metabolic labeling of protein synthesis with 35 S-Met and 35 S-Cys. Metabolic labeling was performed on mock PNS, heat-inactivated mock PNS, and PNS prepared from BSR cells co-transfected with the wild-type replicase and Tmed template. Coomassie staining demonstrated that these samples contained similar amounts of total protein ( Figure 6A) . A synthesis of 35 S-labeled proteins was readily detected in mock PNS and replicase-expressing PNS ( Figure 6B ), despite the fact that the IVRA reaction conditions might not be optimal for protein synthesis. Heat inactivation of PNS prior to metabolic labeling abolished the incorporation of 35 S (Figure 6B) , confirming that the radioactive signal in lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 6B is the result of translation. The translation inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide were added to PNS prior to metabolic labeling, and this inhibited the de novo production of proteins in vitro as the incorporation of 35 S into proteins was no longer observed, while the total protein content of the samples was practically unaffected (Figure 6C,D) . When these translation inhibitors were added during IVRA, the RNA synthesizing activity remained unchanged ( Figure 6E ), demonstrating that ongoing protein synthesis is not required for RNA synthesis in vitro. Figure 6 . In vitro RNA-synthesizing activity is not dependent on translation. BSR cells were either mock-transfected or co-transfected with the P1234 and Tmed constructs, and PNS was prepared at 16 h post transfection.

Cells were harvested at 6 and 16 h post transfection, and membranes containing the polyprotein and polymerase were mixed with an in vitro transcribed RNA to study if they were able to replicate an exogenous template. However, the added RNA was rapidly degraded in the P15 fraction, and thus RC-containing membranes were further purified from PNS. First, we tested HA-specific affinity capture using HA-tagged nsP3. Western blotting showed that the polyprotein P123 or nsP4 did not bind to the HA-specific agarose beads ( Figure 7A ). When the cleavable polyprotein P1234 was expressed in cells, we observed binding of nsP3 ( Figure 7A ). However, nsP4 did not bind in this case either, indicating that bound nsP3 was not in a complex with the other nsPs. Thus, we next tested the purification of membranes using flotation centrifugation in an iodixanol step-gradient. The light-scattering band was collected and Western blotting confirmed the presence of the polyprotein P123 and nsP4 in the membrane fractions ( Figure 7B ). Next, the membrane fractions were provided with an exogenous template, the positive polarity in vitro transcript of Tmed, and IVRAs were performed. In-gel hybridization confirmed the presence of significant amounts of exogenous Tmed RNA transcript in both membrane fractions after the IVRA had been performed ( Figure 7C, lower panel) . The membrane fraction prepared from the cells harvested at 6 h post transfection contained more in vitro transcript than the sample prepared 16 h post transfection, suggesting that RNase activity was somewhat higher in the flotation samples prepared from cells at the later time point post transfection. Although exogenous Tmed transcript was present throughout the incubation with the membrane fractions, no incorporation of 32 P-CTP into viral RNA was detected ( Figure 7C, upper panel) , despite the fact that template RNA was still present at the end of the reaction ( Figure 7C, lower panel) .",

Highly diluted PNS from infected cells was routinely used in the IVRA, demonstrating the robustness of the in vitro RNA-synthesizing activity of SFV. Albeit less active, the RCs isolated from transfected cells were also functional in making both genomic and subgenomic RNA (Figure 4) . A combination of the in vitro RNA synthesis assay and trans-replication system can also be applied to study the replication of CHIKV, as a trans-replication system is available for this highly pathogenic alphavirus as well [28] . Infection and the trans-replication system only yielded isolated RCs that synthesized exclusively plus-strand RNA ( Figure 5 ). These complexes thus represent late-stage RCs formed by nsP1 to nsP4 and are dedicated to the synthesis of plus strands [8, 21] . Here, the optimal time point to isolate active RCs from SFV-infected cells was around 4 h.p.i. (Figure 1) , and thus the observed plus-strand synthesis is consistent with SFV minus-strand synthesis ceasing between 3 and 4 h.p.i. in mammalian cells [43] . Furthermore, our and previous metabolic labeling studies of SFV-infected cells also indicate that viral replication is maximal at this time [32] . Endogenous minus strands and replication activity were mainly found in the membrane fraction prepared from SFV-infected cells, while endogenous plus strands were more abundant in the cytosolic fraction ( Figure 1) . The same has been observed with CHIKV-infected cells [25] , and confirms the idea that the membranous spherules accommodate the minus-strand RNA as well as the active replication complex [23] [24] [25] . Interestingly, the cytosolic fractions from the trans-replication system contained more minus-strand RNA than those from infected cells. However, the minus-strand RNA in the cytosolic fraction from transfected cells was insensitive to RNases (Figure 3 ), suggesting it is in spherules or other protective structures. This is also supported by the observation that the ratio of the activity between the S15 and P15 fractions was higher in the samples prepared from the transfected cells than in those obtained from infected cells (Figures 1 and 4) . These differences in spherule distribution might be explained by their subcellular location. With the infection conditions described here, SFV spherules are mainly located in small endocytic vesicles and perinuclear cytopathic vacuoles [18] . In the trans-replication system, spherules mainly stay at the plasma membrane [29] .",

It has been observed that the early RCs consisting of P123 and nsP4, although primarily synthesizing minus strands, are also able to make plus strands [6, 8, 21, 24] , albeit inefficiently compared to late-stage RCs. However, it is intriguing how dramatic the difference in the minus-strand RNA synthesis was. If we assume that minus strands represent RCs, our results imply that the partially uncleaved replicase is able to make significantly higher numbers of RCs compared to the wild-type replicase. This suggestion is in line with the requirement of partially uncleaved replicase to form spherules without the template [29] . Furthermore, Western blotting showed that in all replicase constructs the polymerase nsP4 was enriched in the membrane fraction, with the exception that in P1234 GAA it did not become membrane-associated but mainly remained free in the cytosol (Figure 2 ). Because the spherule assembly without active viral replication is achieved only if P23 remains uncleaved [29] , RCs are not formed using a fully cleaved construct P1234 GAA , and consequently nsP4 stays cytosolic, explaining our results. Thus, the recruitment of nsP4 to the RC requires its catalytic activity and the presence of a template RNA.",

Likewise, the activity of isolated SFV RCs did not require ongoing translation in the in vitro assay (Figure 6 ), suggesting that (the bulk of) the activity that is measured in our assay can be attributed to the existing isolated RCs and that new RCs that might be formed (if at all) de novo during the reaction do not contribute significantly. Translation inhibitors did not boost replication either, indicating that ribosomes caused no significant stall of the polymerase complex. In SFV-infected cells, which synthesize both minus and plus strands, translation inhibitors cause selective shut off of the minus-strand RNA synthesis [43] . However, overproduction of the nonstructural proteins does not lead to increased RNA synthesis in SFV-infected cells [44] .",

This indicates that after P123 and nsP4 have formed early RCs and synthesized the minus-strand in cells, they do not continue to make additional minus strands (in vitro). This is supported by the observation that a translation inhibitor blocks continuous minus-strand synthesis in SFV-and SINV-infected cells [43, 45] . Furthermore, membranes containing the polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were unable to initiate RNA synthesis in vitro using an exogenous template ( Figure 7 ). As it has been shown that the partially uncleaved replicase forms spherules without the template [29] , we speculate that the proteins were sequestered in spherules and did not have access to and so could not recruit the cytosolic template.",

NS4B is a membrane protein, and the scaffolding protein HCV RCs and affinity capture resulted in an enrichment of DMVs capable of the de novo synthesis of HCV RNA. Thus, we also probed a similar approach to isolate SFV replicase proteins by tagging nsP3, which is known to tolerate insertions [18] . However, HA-affinity capture could not be used to purify complexes of P123 and nsP4 or complexes of nsP3 and nsP4; only nsP3 bound to the capture beads ( Figure 7 ) and most likely represented cytoplasmic aggregates of nsP3 [46, 47] , supporting our hypothesis that nsPs engaged in replication are sequestered in spherules. Consequently, the results indicate that the minus-strand synthesis requires that RCs or spherules are assembled at the same time as the minus-strand synthesis is initiated, and this was not achieved in vitro because the replicase proteins had already formed spherules. The recent cryo-electron tomographic reconstruction of Flock House virus (FHV) spherules also suggests that the minus-strand is synthesized simultaneously with spherule formation [23] . However, although the minus-strand synthesis seems to depend on the RC assembly, SFV spherule formation does not depend on viral RNA replication [29] .",

However, SINV P123 and nsP4 are also able to form spherules without the template [29] , and it will be interesting to test if these replicase proteins are able to replicate an exogenous RNA template, when expressed analogously to the SFV system we have used in this study. Furthermore, it will be important to compare this system to the vaccinia virus-based expression system used in the previous SINV studies. Interestingly, SINV nsP4 purified from Escherichia coli synthesizes RNA in vitro if combined with a P123-membrane fraction and template RNA [16] , and thus it might be that in the vaccinia virus-based expression system there are P123 and nsP4 proteins which have not yet formed spherules and are thus able to recruit and replicate an exogenous template.",

In contrast, the polymerase nsP4 together with nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 was highly active in vitro and these late RCs could be isolated for in vitro analyses. The next step to shed light on the mechanisms and molecular details that underlie the differences between the early and late RCs would be to analyse their formation from template recruitment to RNA synthesis and membrane deformation. This will, however, require that we freeze RC assembly at different stages. It has been shown that P123 alone does not form spherule structures [29] . Thus, an interesting model system could be provided by the purified nsP4 combined with a P123-membrane fraction and template RNA [16] . For SINV, such a system is active in de novo RNA synthesis, indicating that RC assembly is achievable in vitro if the template RNA is provided before nsP4 has associated with the polyprotein P123.",
