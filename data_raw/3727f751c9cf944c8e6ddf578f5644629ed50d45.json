            "text": "Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) icosahedral virus classified to be the only member in the family Amnoonviridae. Although TiLV segment-1 shares homology with the influenza C virus PB1 and has four conserved motifs similar to influenza A, B, and C polymerases, it is unknown whether there are other properties shared between TiLV and orthomyxovirus. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH 4 Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH 4 Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.",

E-11 cells were used to propagate TiLV, while SHK-1 cells were used to grow ISAV. Near confluent monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by adding the virus suspension and incubation for 1 h at 28 \u2022 C (TiLV) and 15 \u2022 C (ISAV) to allow virus adsorption onto the cells. The cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the unbound virus was washed off three times using PBS and freshly prepared growth media containing 2.5% FBS was added to the cells. Cell culture flasks infected with TiLV were cultured at 28 \u2022 C, while ISAV-infected flasks were cultured at 15 \u2022 C. The virus was harvested when the cytopathic effect (CPE) was fully developed by centrifugation of the supernatant from each flask at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The virus supernatant harvested from each flask was filtered at a size of 22 \u00b5m to remove cell debris. Each virus was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until use. The influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8, designated as PR8 in this study, was grown in the allantois membranes of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and harvested after 3 days.

Confluent monolayers were washed twice using PBS before treatment using various concentrations of NH 4 Cl. Experiments using NH 4 Cl treatment of E-11 cells were done in two parts, of which the first part was to determine the toxicity of different concentrations of NH 4 Cl on E-11 cells. To do this, the concentrations of NH 4 Cl tested were 1, 5, 20, 25, 30, and 50 mM. Once the different NH 4 Cl concentrations mixed with growth media were put on the cells followed by incubation at 28 \u2022 C, the cells were observed every hour to check for toxicity based on morphological changes and cell death. The second part was to test the impact of NH 4 Cl on replication of TiLV in E-11 cells once the optimal duration that did not cause toxicity on the cells was determined. To do this, cells were treated with NH 4 Cl during virus adsorption, while post-adsorption treatment was done at 1, 2, or 3 h post-infection (hpi). Cells were infected with TiLV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.0 and adsorbed for 1 h at 28 \u2022 C to allow for virus binding onto E-11 cells. The cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. After 1 h of virus adsorption, any unbound virus was washed off three times using PBS. The cells were cultured in normal growth media containing 5% FBS after NH 4 Cl treatment. Three negative control cell culture flasks without NH 4 Cl treatment and cells treated with NH 4 Cl but without virus infection were included in the study. The positive control group consisted of cells infected with the virus at MOI 1.0 without NH 4 Cl treatment. All cells were incubated at 28 \u2022 C and monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) development.

The viruses used in the assay were PR8 titrated in a two-fold dilution in row A, starting with the highest concentration of 512 HA units, while ISAV was titrated in a two-fold dilution in rows B and C, starting with the highest concentration of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL in column 1. The HA titer used for PR8 had no direct link to the TiLV and ISAV TCID 50 /mL. As shown in Figure 1 , four concentrations of TiLV, starting with 10 7 , 10 6 , 10 5 , and 10 4 TCID 50 /mL, were diluted two-fold in rows D, E, F, and G, respectively, while row H was used as a negative PBS control. Note that the highest dilution factor at which PR8 agglutinated turkey erythrocytes was 1:128/50 \u00b5L, as shown in Figure 1 , while the weak stripping of unbound turkey RBCs for the same plate were held at a 60 \u2022 angle, as shown in Figure S2 . Elution of the PR8 from turkey erythrocytes was not observed even after 4 h of incubation at room temperature and 12 h incubation at 4 \u2022 C. However, there was no agglutination of turkey erythrocytes by ISAV and TiLV ( Figure 2 ) and no stripping of RBCs, as shown in Figure S2 , when the same plate was held at a 60 \u2022 angle in order to detect the stripping of non-agglutinated RBCs, similar to observations seen in the PBS negative control in row H. In summary, only PR8 agglutinated turkey erythrocytes, while neither of the piscine viruses (TiLV and ISAV) agglutinated the turkey RBCs (Table 2) . ",

Erythrocytes from several species, such as chicken, turkey, equine, guinea pigs, and humans, possess both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages [22] . Hence, it is likely that the influenza virus strain PR8 used here binds \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linkages on RBCs found in different host species, including avian and piscine species. Paramyxoviruses, such as the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), share the Neu5,9Ac 2 antigenic determinant with orthomyxoviruses [39] . Other viruses that use the Neu5,9Ac 2 receptor include coronaviruses. This receptor has been reported in various species, such as humans, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, horses, chicken, turkey, goose, salmonids, crucian carp, mollusks, and sea urchins [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Unlike influenza C, ISAV specifically binds Neu4,5Ac 2 glycans on host cells using its hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. This HE is unique when compared with the HA or hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) proteins of other orthomyxoviruses, where the sequence identity is very low (<10%). The ISAV HE sequences shares sequence similarity with non-orthomyxoviruses, such as toroviruses and coronaviruses, by <25% [51] [52] [53] . It is this high specificity of the ISAV HE protein for Neu4,5Ac 2 glycans which make it different from other orthomyxoviruses, and may be what accounts for ISAV having lower tropism and mostly binding to fish RBCs, unlike other orthomyxoviruses which bind a wide range of RBCs from different avian, mammalian, and piscine species.",

            "text": "Given that the HA and HE proteins that bind RBCs in hemagglutination assays also serve as ligands that bind Sia receptors used for virus entry into host cells, the inability of TiLV to bind RBCs suggests that it uses mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry into and replication within host cells. This observation is supported by our findings regarding the NH 4 Cl treatment of E-11 cells infected by TiLV. Studies into cell attachment and replication mechanisms of orthomyxoviruses showed that after HA binding to Sia receptors on host cells, the virus is taken up into endosomal compartments by endocytosis. The low endosomal pH mediates the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes to facilitate virus uncoating, leading to release of nucleoproteins required for virus replication by acid-dependent cellular proteases. The pH dependence of viral uncoating has been completely paralleled with the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes [35] . As such, raising the endosomal or lysosomal pH by adding weak lysosomotropic bases like chloroquine and NH 4 Cl has been shown to prevent virus uncoating, thereby blocking virus replication [35, 54] . This phenomenon is supported by several studies [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] including Matlin et al. [60] , who showed that NH 4 Cl treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was able to block the uncoating of the influenza virus in endosomal compartments, leading to replication failure and culminating in the prevention of infection. Other viruses where replication was shown to be inhibited by NH 4 Cl treatment include alphaviruses [55] , herpes simplex virus type 1 [56] , reoviruses [57] , and coronaviruses [58, 59] . In the present study, NH 4 Cl treatment neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells, as there was no difference in virus replication in NH 4 Cl-treated or -nontreated cells.",
