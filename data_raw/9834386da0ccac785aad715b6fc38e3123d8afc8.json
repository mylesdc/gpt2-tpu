China officially initiated the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) in January 2004.

Reported morbidity and mortality were calculated per 100,000 persons. The morbidity rates by male or female sex presented as per 100,000 of that sex category. Population density is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants registered in public health facilities by land area in square kilometers. Cases density is calculated by dividing the number of reported cases by land area in square kilometers. Descriptive analysis method was used to analyze the overall morbidity, deaths and ranking orders of notifiable diseases in children aged 0-14 years in Zhejiang Province in 2008-2017. Chi-square test was used to compare count data. Pearson's correlation test was used to analyze whether population density and cases density correlated with each other. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Previous studies also believed that the risk of severe cases and death is significantly higher in younger patients [20, 21] , suggesting that reducing the prevalence of severe illness and mortality in young children should be the focus of prevention and control. Before 2012, the predominant serotype was EV71; since 2013 other enteroviruses became the predominant serotype. This result of viruses proportions in last five years was similar to the study of Thailand in 2016 [22] .",

This study showed that other infectious diarrheal diseases mainly occurred in the 0~year-old group and the 1~year-old group, accounting for 75.57%. Deaths mainly occurred in 0~year-old infants. The potential reasons for this may be related to the following factors. The immune system and intestinal functions of infants and young children are not yet fully developed on the one hand, and it may also be closely related to their own health status and their parents' poor health-related knowledge and health habits on the other hand [22] . In 2008, the vaccine containing mumps component (the measles-mumps-rubella combination vaccine) was included in the national immunization program. The results of this study showed that the morbidity of mumps in children aged 0-14 years in Zhejiang Province dropped from 264.78/100,000 in 2008 to 77.59/100,000 in 2017, showing a significant downward trend, consistent with the situations in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai [23] .",

Since the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, with the strengthened influenza prevention and control work requirements and the expansion of influenza surveillance areas, the reported morbidity of influenza in children under the age of 15 in Zhejiang province has been on the rise. It is recommended that vaccination against influenza and antiviral drugs should be adopted for the prevention and treatment of influenza in children [27] , and vaccination is a crucial step in preventing influenza and reducing health care-related infections [28] .",

According to two surveys by China CDC in 2013 and 2015, both of which were based on a nationally representative sample of about 2000 cases in CISDCP, the rates of underreporting for all notifiable infectious disease were less than 10% [35, 36] .

However, morbidity of Class C infectious diseases showed a fluctuating upward trend at the same time. We should focus on the prevention and control of HFMD, other infectious diarrheal diseases, mumps and influenza in children aged 0-14 years in Zhejiang Province. It is recommended to strengthen epidemic surveillance, take early prevention and control measures (such as timely vaccination, risk population management, nosocomial infection control, supervision, feedback, and objective assessment), to reduce the incidence rate of infectious diseases in younger children.",
