Examples include the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Avian Influenza, where viruses cross species boundaries to infect humans from simians [1] , and birds [2] , respectively. The interactions between virus and host proteins are essential to the completion of virus life cycle, and impact directly on the pathology of infectious diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, studies of host-virus interactions are critical to understanding of the virology and development of therapeutics for viral diseases. Since host switching, host specificity, and disease severity all depend on host-virus interactions, comparative studies of host-virus interactions may help unravel the host/viral factors key to these central themes in infectious disease studies.",

Comparative studies have provided clues to the differential susceptibility to AIDS between the two species [8] [9] [10] . However, since human and chimpanzee protein sequences are almost identical in most of the cases [11] , the amino acid substitutions that may lead to Homo-Pan divergences in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have remained elusive. Nevertheless, it is feasible to pinpoint species-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs), which are known to affect hostvirus protein interactions [12, 13] and can be altered by minor genetic changes such as single nucleotide substitutions or small insertions/deletions (indels). PTMs are pivotal to a wide range of biological processes, including signal transduction, protein targeting, receptor specificity, and PPIs [14] . So far, comparative tools for exploring the potential influences of species-specific PTMs on host-virus interactions have not been found.",

            "text": "Here we develop a web-based interactive database -CAPIH (Comparative Analysis of Protein Interactions for HIV-1) -for comparative studies of genetic differences between the human proteins involved in host-HIV protein interactions and their orthologues retrieved from three mammalian species: chimpanzee (Pan troglodyte), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and mouse (Mus musculus). The three latter species are all important animal models for HIV studies [15] [16] [17] . Understanding the differences in host-virus interplay between human and the model species is the basis for correct interpretation of animal-based HIV studies. Furthermore, by comparing protein interactions between species, one can potentially identify key differences that underlie chimpanzee resistance to AIDS. To facilitate inter-species comparisons of host-HIV PPIs, four main functions are provided in CAPIH. Firstly, the interface shows the presence or absence of orthologous proteins, thus enabling users to pinpoint missing protein components in the host-HIV interaction network. Secondly, the multiple sequence alignments of orthologous proteins enable users to identify species-specific amino acid substitutions, nucleotide substitutions, and indels. This information is helpful for inferring functional changes of orthologous proteins. Thirdly, predictions of 7 types of species-only PTMs (phosphorylation, methylation, sumoylation, acetylation, sulfation, N-glycosylation, and O-glycosylation) for each HIV-interacting host protein are presented for analyses of potential PTM influences on protein interactions and signal/regulatory pathway. We also collect experimentally verified PTMs in human proteins. Fourthly, CAPIH shows potential PPI hot sites on the multiple sequence alignments. Through the visualized interface, researchers can easily spot multiple host factors that directly or indirectly interact with the same HIV protein, and consider how changes in one member protein may affect the protein interaction network.",

We retrieved a total of 1,447 HIV-1 interacting human proteins from the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database [18] (the November 13, 2007 freeze). The humanchimpanzee-macaque-mouse orthologous proteins were downloaded from the Ensembl genome browser (release 47), which were identified by the Ensembl project using the Markov clustering algorithm [19] . Note that not all the retrieved human proteins have orthologues in all of the three compared species. In the cases of one-to-many/ many-to-many orthologous relationships, only the protein pairs with the reciprocally highest similarity were selected. All of the protein and nucleotide sequences were downloaded from Ensembl. Also note that, among the 1,447 retrieved human proteins, 77 proteins had no Ensembl-identified orthologues in any of the compared species. The remaining 1,370 orthologous protein groups were subsequently aligned using the MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment package [20] . Based on the protein alignments, the corresponding transcripts were aligned and separated into 3 types of genomic regions: 3'UTRs, 5'UTRs and coding sequences (CDSs). Since CAPIH aims to identify species-specific genetic changes ( Figure 1B) , only orthologous genes from at least three species were considered. In this interface, species-specific indels were identified by using the INDELSCAN Web server [21, 22] . Meanwhile, CAPIH shows 7 types of species-specific PTM sites, which were identified by 7 well-known PTM prediction packages with default parameters (including MEMO [23] , SUMOsp [24] , NetOGlyc [25] , NetNGlyc, SulfoSite [26] , and NetAcet [27] ; Table 1 ). Considering the relatively low quality of chimpanzee and macaque genomic sequences, we used the Phred quality score of 25 as a cut-off to filter out potential false positive predictions. The quality scores of chimpanzee and macaque genomic sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser [28] . In the case of indels, the quality scores of the 15 nucleotides on either side of the indel were averaged. Whereas in the case of PTMs, 15 nucleotides on either side (i.e. 5 amino acid residues) plus the three nucleotides of the PTM-affected amino acid were taken into account. The potential protein interaction hot sites were identified using 3D-partner [29] .",

Collectively, the interface has identified more than 86,000, 21,000, and 33,000 species-specific amino acid substitutions, indels, and PTM events, respectively, in the four species. For lineage-specific PTM events, in general, phosphorylation account for the largest proportion of all PTM events, followed by glycosylation (O-and N-linked types together), methylation, sulfation, sumoylation, and lastly by acetylation (Table 3) . We find that rhesus macaque has a much larger number of species-specific PTM events than hominoids, whereas human and chimpanzee have approximately equal numbers. Since the annotations of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genes have remained incomplete, we are conservative about the estimates of the numbers of species-specific PTMs. For accuracy, we further exclude the PTM events that occur in indels (including both lineage-and non-lineage-specific indels), all the numbers of lineage-specific PTMs are thus decreased dramatically (Table 3) . Nevertheless, each of the hominoids still has more than 950 species-specific PTM events, and rhesus macaque has ~4,600. This observation is consistent with the primate phylogeny. Considering that chimpanzee is highly resistant to developing AIDS while the other two are not, it is of great interest to investigate whether these PTM events play important roles in AIDS development after HIV-1 infections.",

Alternatively, the user can also look up the proteins of interest in the protein table, which includes all the proteins analyzed in the interface. All the proteins that match the query key word will be shown with a plus \"+\" sign in front ( Figure  2B ). Detailed information of each protein can be shown by clicking on the \"+\" sign ( Figures. 3 and 4 ).

The user can further refine the search by submitting a second key word, or return to the homepage and start a new search. For each protein of interest, CAPIH shows the statistical pie diagram of species-specific variations in the \"Genome Comparison Statistics\" section (substitutions in light blue, indels in purple, and PTMs in green color; Figure 3A ). For substitutions and indels, the diagram gives species-specific variations in amino acid sequences, InterPro-predicted protein domains, CDSs, 3'UTR, and 5' UTR (in the top-down direction). Each filled block represents 10 variations. That is, 10 nucleotide substitutions (for CDS and UTRs), amino acid changes (for amino acid and IPR domains), indels, or PTMs. For example, 12 species-specific changes will be shown as 2 filled blocks in the graph.

Inspection of the multiple amino acid sequence alignment of VPRBP reveals that the mouse sequence is shorter than those of the hominoids by nearly 100 amino acid residues at the C-terminus. The C-terminal half of VPRBP has a prolinerich domain and a number of Phe-x-x-Phe repeats, which serves as the Vpr binding domain [39] . Consequently, it is speculated that the loss of the C-terminal amino acids in mouse VPRBP may have certain effects on the Vpr-VPRBP binding affinity. This difference should be experimentally verified, and if proven true, should be taken into account in mouse-based HIV-1 studies.",

Firstly, although mouse is an excellent model for HIV studies, considering the large genetic divergences that occur in protein domains between human and mouse as shown here, many of the host-HIV protein interactions are expected to differ between the two species. Therefore, the differences in genetic backgrounds must be controlled for appropriate interpretations of mouse-based HIV studies.",

Comparative studies of host-virus interactions provide a path to understand the possible mechanisms of how viruses break species boundary into humans, and why they cause pathological conditions in humans but rarely do so in other animals. Differences in PPIs may harbor part of the answers. Since PTMs are critical to PPIs, they should be taken into consideration when analyzing the effects of different PPIs on host pathology. Meanwhile, PTM by itself is actually critical to host-virus interactions. Glycosylation, for example, is widely known to be critical to viral recognition and entrance into target cells.",

For example, human and chimpanzee differ from each other by an average of two amino acids per protein [11] . In comparison, in the 1,370 proteins compared, human and chimpanzee each has more than 600 species-specific substitution-related phosphorylation sites (Table 3) . In other words, on average, each HIV-interacting protein in both human and chimpanzee has an average of 0.4 species-specific phosphorlation sites. This example illustrates the importance of \"PTMome\". Glycome, the collective sum of all glycans and part of the PTMome (if glycolipids are not considered), is known to be remarkably larger than proteome [43, 44] . Therefore, it is easily understandable that PTMome is actually much larger than proteome. The large numbers of species-specific PTMs in HIV-interacting proteins illustrate the great potential of PTM studies in virology and AIDS studies.",

Specifically, comparative analyses of host-HIV interactions may shed some light on the mechanisms of differences in AIDS progression between human and chimpanzee. A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed [8, 45] . However, none of them provides a systematic view in the context of host-HIV protein interactions. Furthermore, PTMs, perhaps one of the most important regulatory mechanisms of host-pathogen protein interactions, have been rarely studied in a comparative way.
