Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, WHO, CDC, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Google, and Cochrane library were extensively searched for ZIKV and mass gathering. It was done from 1947 till May 2016. The keywords emerging diseases, Zika virus, epidemiology, phobia, mass gathering, preparedness, surveillance were searched. Many articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant articles were utilized.",

            "text": "The WHO declared ZIKV a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)\", with triggering funding into research, vector control, and efforts to stop pregnant women becoming infected. 4 In the following part of the manuscript the epidemiology, phobia against ZIKV in mass gathering and recommendation for its prevention and control is being discussed. Descriptive epidemiology of ZIKV: 1. Person: Approximately two-thirds of the world population lives in areas infested by Aedes (Ae.) mosquito vector. 5 Furthermore, anyone who lives in or travels to an areas where ZIKV is already circulating and has not been infected with the virus can get it through mosquito bites. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. In addition, recently it was found that persons can catch infection through person to person transmission. 6 2. Time: The breading season of Ae. mosquitoes is usually during warm and rainy seasons in tropics and subtropics. The mosquito usually bite during the day times (after sunrise and before sunset). 6 primarily monkeys in an \"enzootic mosquitomonkey-mosquito cycle\", with only occasional transmission to humans. Before the current pandemic began in 2007, Zika rarely caused recognized 'spillover' infections in humans, even in highly enzootic areas. In the current pandemic, human is a host of ZIKV and local transmission between human has been reported in many countries and territories 6, 12, 13 Zika antibodies were detected also in ducks, goats, cows, horses, bats, and carabaos. 13 The vector reservoir host is Aedes mosquitoes. 6 3. Environment: Ae. aegypti and albopictus live and lay eggs in the stagnant water collections and water-holding containers (as puddles, buckets, empty cans) around the households. Example of such areas are the peri-domestic areas with absent of the piped water provision; as in the slums in tropics and subtropics. This need warm and rainy season of the tropics and sub-tropics. 7,13",

Oedema of extremities, vertigo, myalgia and digestive disorder may also occur. These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days and the incubation period ranged 3-12 days. 7, 19 The cause of phobia about Zika is due to its suspected implication with increased neonatal microcephaly (as discussed), and other neurological conditions as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 4, 7 Laboratory diagnosis, Infection with ZIKV can be diagnosed by PCR or by IgG and IgM antibodies detection. 7, 20 Mass gathering and phobia from Zika virus: Mass gatherings (MGs) may be big sports occasion, religious events, political or cultural events, and rock concerts. 21, 22 It occur worldwide on any given day, and Mass-Gathering Health (MGH) is a relatively new discipline. 23 MGs have diverse public health challenges and need more international considerations, especially in presence of many emerging & re-emerging diseases and other health problems. This occurs in era of widely accessible air travel, and the world globalization. 24 These events can put millions of international travellers and local host-country residents at risk of acquiring many infectious diseases, including locally endemic emerging infectious diseases as ZIKV. 25 Future mass gatherings in Americas (example from Brazil): This spiky spread of ZIKV in Americas, especially in Brazil, poses both phobia and challenges during preparing for both the Olympics and Paralympics games which will be held in Rio De Janeiro during August and September, 2016 and also all future mass gathering that will take place in similar highly infectious countries. 7, 20 Brazil is working and needs to work more to protect more than 16,000 athletes and 600,000 visitors from catching ZIKV infections. There are claims and counter-claims about the suggested cancellation of these big occasions, after the big budget spent for preparing such events. Some countries have expressed fear about attending the MG events. 7 However, the Brazilians' officials said that among the factors that may decrease this phobia is that August is in the dry season, with less incidence of the mosquito that usually lays its eggs on stagnant water. Furthermore, Brazil is making efforts now in their war for controlling the mosquito and ZIKV before the big sport occasions, and similar upcoming occasions.",
