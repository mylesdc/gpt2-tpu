Unlike influenza A viruses, humans are the sole host of epidemiological relevance for influenza B viruses. This explains why antigenic shift does not occur in these viruses and they are not able to cause pandemics. However, influenza B viruses evolve mainly through genetic reassortment between strains of different lineages. This allows for escape from host immunity and preservation of the ability to cause disease [2] . Regardless of the lineage, influenza B infection can cause severe disease and death [1] .",

            "text": "For many years, vaccine administration has been demonstrated as the best solution to reduce the influenza disease burden in humans [3, 4] . However, in the past, the recommended vaccines included only one influenza B lineage, chosen by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on surveillance data and using the lineage that had been observed to dominate in the previous year [5] . Only recently, quadrivalent vaccines containing both influenza B lineages have been prepared and licensed in some countries [6] . However, mainly because of the increased cost of vaccination, trivalent vaccines are still commonly used worldwide. It has been presumed that the prevalence of a given influenza B lineage may be driven by the virus contained in the trivalent vaccine, and the introduction of the quadrivalent preparation may reduce the selective pressure responsible for the modifications in lineage prevalence [7] . However, the relatively common emergence of influenza B re-assortants suggests that strict monitoring of the genetic characteristics of the circulating strains is necessary in order to assure the best selection of B viruses to be included in influenza vaccines. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses circulating in a region of Northern Italy, Lombardia, during the influenza season of 2015-2016.",

Both institutions are located in Lombardia, a region of Northern Italy with approximately 10 million inhabitants. Nasopharyngeal swabs from all subjects, regardless of age and previous diagnosis of an underlying disease, presenting to the emergency room of both institutions for signs and/or symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) according to the definition of the Italian Ministry of Health [8] , were collected and analyzed for respiratory viruses, including influenza. ILI is an acute respiratory disease of sudden onset, with fever (a temperature of >38\u02daC) accompanied by at least one general symptom (i.e., headache, generalized malaise, a feverish sensation such as sweating and chills or asthenia) and at least one respiratory symptom (i.e., cough, pharyngodynia or nasal congestion). The respiratory symptoms had to have lasted at least three days to be considered in the analysis, and only one new-onset illness could be included in any two-week period. Data regarding influenza vaccination coverage were collected from parents. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, and written informed consent was obtained from the enrolled subjects. For all the children, informed consent was signed by both parents or a legal guardian. Children !8 years were required to give their written assent before entering the study.",

            "text": "Antigenic characterization of influenza B strains is important in the assessment of the similarity between reference viruses and circulating viruses. In addition, these characterizations are also useful annually to the WHO to recommend which influenza strains should be included in the vaccine for the Northern hemisphere. Based on phylogenetic data, all the influenza B strains circulating in the two children's hospitals belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade within the B/Victoria-lineage. This finding is similar to the epidemiological scenario observed during the last influenza season by sentinel sources of the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) [17] and the Italian National Influenza Center [18] , that reported an incidence of 85.9% and 95.0%, respectively, for strains belonging to the B/Victoria-lineage. Unfortunately, during the 2015-2016 season the B/Victoria-lineage strain was not included in the trivalent vaccine licensed for the Northern hemisphere worldwide. According to WHO recommendation a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage) was included.\\\\ Therefore, this finding could be the reason for the high circulation of B/Victoria-lineage strains in Italy as well as throughout some other European countries. Data collected by the ECDC [17] clearly indicate that besides Italy, also in Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, B virus was the predominant cause of influenza. In the whole Italy prevalence of B influenza virus was 57% [18] , a value not substantially different from that found in this study. Based on these epidemiological data, the WHO has changed the recommendation for the 2016-2017 influenza trivalent vaccine composition for the Northern hemisphere [5] . In contrast, the use of a quadrivalent vaccine containing two influenza B strains could reduce the mismatch between vaccine and circulating influenza strains. Although a quadrivalent influenza vaccine is licensed in Italy for subjects !3 years, its use is still restricted, mainly because it is not definitively established if the introduction of this more expensive vaccine is really cost/effective. Among the detected B strains, three were characterized by a different pattern of mutations. Two of them harbored the I97M, K209N and T258A mutations, while one strain harbored the K56N, V124A and D526E mutations. These strains belong to two out of three B/Brisbane/60/2008 subclades previously described to circulate in Australia in 2015 [19] . In detail, as reported by Barr and colleagues [19] , the time to the most recent common ancestor calculated for these three subclades was summer 2013. This finding suggests a multiple introduction of different influenza B strains during the last influenza season in the Lombardy region. The evolution of the influenza B virus is driven by mutations on the membrane-distal domain of HA1 in specific domains such as loop-120, loop-150, loop-160 and helix 190 [20] . Several mutations have been observed in these specific regions, but the great majority of them were characteristic of the circulating strains (i.e., I117V, N129D and V146I), while the other mutations were observed in a few influenza strains as only sporadic occurrences. In four influenza B strains, a loss of an important glycosylation site in position 194-196 (HA1) was observed. In an experimental egg-adapted influenza B variant, the absence of glycans at residue 194 was observed [21] . In fact, these influenza virus variants have been observed to grow better in chicken eggs than mammalian virus variants of the same origin [21] . This finding suggests a possible impact of this loss in the antibody recognition after vaccination.",

However, our data are in accordance with the recent publication of Vijaykrishna et al. that reported a dN/dS ratio of 0.19 for the Victoria-lineage viruses [23] . An overall analysis of selective pressure within the influenza strains sequenced here revealed only one site under positive selection and a series of codons under purifying selection. This finding suggests a moderate immune selection in the Victoria-lineage of influenza B virus persistently circulating in humans. In addition, it has also shown that influenza B evolution could be driven by both positive and negative selection. This moderate evolution of circulating influenza B strains makes these strains antigenically similar to the vaccine strain. Indeed, since the 2009-2010 season, the influenza B vaccine strain, B/Brisbane/60/2008, has not been changed [5] . These data, together with the antigenic characterizations performed by ECDC using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI), showed an HI reactivity pattern for the circulating influenza B strains. These data confirm the efficacy of the influenza vaccine on the protection against influenza B circulating strains. However, based on epidemiological data from this study, it would be more appropriate to use of the quadrivalent instead of the trivalent vaccine.",

However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in HA regions involved in the receptor binding or in the antibody recognition [the 120 loop (position 116-137), the 150 loop (141-151), the 160 loop (162-167) and the helix 190 (194-202) [15] (Fig 1B). In detail, B/Milano/40NIC/2016, B/Milano/28CA/2016 and B/Milano/35CA/2016 harbored the N197D substitution, while the B/Milano/19AT/2016 strain was characterized by a different amino acid change, T199A, highlighted in red in Fig 1B.Interestingly, these changes led to the loss of a glycosylation site near the receptor-binding region (helix-190).",
