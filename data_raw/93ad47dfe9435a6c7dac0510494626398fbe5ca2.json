In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals. While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral.",

The two largest recorded outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD), which include the recent 2013-2016 Ebola virus outbreak in Western Africa and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, illustrate the critical need for the development and approval of medical countermeasures. These countermeasures could potentially treat patients with suspected EVD, prevent the development of disease following a known exposure, or protect those at risk for possible exposure, such family members or health care workers and laboratory support staff working to control EVD outbreaks.",

The World Health Organization recommends that patients with suspected EVD are treated with an antimalarial empirically when malaria diagnostics are not available or when test results are delayed 1 . In August of 2014, an Ebola treatment center in Liberia was in short supply of the standard antimalarial combination drug (artemether-lumefantrine) used for patients with suspected EVD. As a result, 71 patients with confirmed EVD were prescribed the antimalarial combination drug which contains the compounds artesunate (AS) and amodiaquine (AQ). A recent study evaluated and compared the outcome of these EVD patients who were prescribed artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) with those who received artemether-lumefantrine 2 . Patients who were prescribed ASAQ had a 31% lower risk of death relative to a group of 191 patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine. All patients were admitted into the same treatment www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ center within a 5-month span, had confirmed EVD, and had no other obvious changes in their care during this period. Another retrospective study performed on data from 5 Ebola treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone also showed a trend towards decreased mortality in EVD patients that received ASAQ 3 . As both artemether and AS are derivatives of artemisinin, the potential beneficial anti-EBOV effect observed with ASAQ could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to AQ. Alternatively, the improved response might be attributed to adverse effects of lumefantrine in EVD patients rather than improved treatment.",

After 3 days of dosing with 20 mg/kg in healthy male and female macaques, AQ was well-tolerated. The higher dose of 40 mg/kg resulted in a variety of clinical observations including hypoactivity, shivering (muscle tremors) and/or diarrhea. Extreme hypoactivity was observed in a single male of the 40 mg/kg group that resolved after dosing ceased. Animals in both the 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg groups had lower blood pressure readings than at predose on both dosing days, typically at 4 and/or 6 h post-dosing. Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters for both doses were analyzed and fell within normal ranges with the exception of liver enzymes. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated 2.6-to 6.3-fold on day 4 at 24 h after the 3 rd dose.

In vitro studies confirmed that the active metabolite also has anti-EBOV properties in Huh 7 and Vero E6 cells, and primary human macrophages, with IC 50 's ranging from 2.8-30.0 \u00b5M \u00b5M depending on experiment and the cell type. In contrast, AS and its metabolite DHA demonstrated minimal to no in vitro antiviral activity against EBOV when tested side-by-side to AQ using our assay parameters. When used in combination, AS and AQ did not have a synergistic effect on EBOV replication in vitro. Whereas AS could possibly act with AQ to impact the whole body-system in response to EBOV in a way that cannot be replicated in the in vitro assays, this study assumed that AQ was the main contributing factor of the drug combination resulting in anti-EBOV activity. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The goal of the study was to treat animals with AQ using a similar dosing strategy as for human patients, with a target blood concentration range of the parent compound AQ of 29.2 \u00b1 10.9 ng/mL 12 . Indeed, we found that a 20 mg/kg AQ dose using the 3-day treatment regimen resulted in correlating plasma levels of 7.8-31.9 ng/ mL in healthy NHPs. However, this treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease symptoms in EBOV-infected animals. These results are disappointing and highlight the importance of utilizing relevant animal models of EVD to evaluate potential antivirals, including detailed characterization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability in the context of EVD. Whereas AQ treatment did not lead to detectable beneficial effects on EVD progression in NHPs, there may be value in investigating novel AQ derivatives that have been improved for anti-EBOV potency and/or improved tolerability 22 .",

Whereas AS has no measurable anti-EBOV effect when tested in combination with AQ in vitro, the drug could have an in vivo effect that is not captured in cell culture assays. AS and artemether are derivatives of artemisinin and are both metabolized to DHA, the active metabolite for the treatment of malaria. However, AS www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ is water soluble, and reaches peak concentration more rapidly with higher plasma C max than artemether, which could impact in vivo activity against EBOV. Another consideration is that AS and AQ may affect each other in terms of PK, drug metabolism, or disposition. For example, AS co-administration with AQ has been reported to reduce exposure to AQ 12 . Questions remain on the possible contribution of AS to the beneficial effect of the ASAQ treatment observed in EVD patients 2 . Therefore, testing the co-formulation would have value, but without testing each drug singly as well, attribution of any observed effect to a specific component will be challenging. Other confounding factors not measured in the Gignoux study could have accounted for the beneficial effect of ASAQ 2 . The potential impact of concurrent malaria and the type of antimalarial used in EVD patients was not addressed in our study. In conclusion, treatment with AQ did not have a beneficial effect on survival or the symptoms of EVD in rhesus macaques under the conditions tested. Whereas AQ on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of AQ when used in combination with another antiviral. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Cells and virus. Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586, Manassas, VA), HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), and Huh 7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were maintained following recommended protocols. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were generated as previously described 25 . Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 (EBOV/Mak, GenBank accession no. KX000400.1) was propagated in Vero E6 cells (BEI resources, NIAID, NIH: VERO C1008 (E6), African green monkey kidney, Working Bank #NR-596) as previously described 26 .

The antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ Winthrop) (Sanofi-Aventis, Gentilly Cedex, France) was solubilized by crushing the tablets and resuspending in dimethyl sulfoxide to prepare a solution with the AQ component at a concentration of 100 mM. The compounds, amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (#A2799), artesunate (#A3731), and dihydroartemisinin (#D7439) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). N-desethylamodiaquine hydrochloride (#Sc-212178) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Drugs were prepared as 100 mM stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. Animal studies. Source, formulation, and preparation of amodiaquine hydrochloride was the same for the PK and the efficacy studies. Amodiaquine hydrochloride was obtained from US Pharmacopeia (Rockville, MD; Cat. 1031004; Lot J01144) and a 4 mg/mL AQ (free base) solution was prepared in Sterile Water for Injection (USP).",
