HEK293 cells were transfected with Ubiquitin-HA expressing plasmid and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 \u00b5M, 2 h) in combination with NH 4 Cl (10 mM) as indicated.

VeroB4 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of BafA1 for 2 h before cells were lysed. The ratios of LC3B-II/I were determined by western blotting (a representative blot is shown). The graph represents the average levels + SEM of three independent experiments. Based on these data, 100 nM BafA1 was chosen for the experiments in all figures assessing autophagic flux as the concentration achieving complete block of autophagosome-lysosome fusion 1 . d HBSS control in VeroB4 cells to demonstrate the induction of autophagic flux.

Thus, the compounds enhance the function of BECN1 in autophagy without changing its protein levels. c VeroB4 cells were treated with ABT-737 for 48 h and cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. d-i Effects of BECN1-targeting compounds. Noninfected (d-g) or MERS-CoV (MOI = 0.001)-infected VeroB4 cells (h,i) were cultivated in the presence of a BECN1-derived peptide (fused to the Tat transduction sequence, \"Tat-B\") or ABT-737. Treatment with a scrambled version of Tat-B (Tat-scr.) or the vehicle of ABT-737 served as controls. After 48 h, the levels of BECN1, LC3B-II/I and P62 were determined by western blotting (d-g; control levels were set to 1), and virus genome copy numbers were determined by RT-PCR (fold difference refers to infected cells treated with scrambled peptide in h and to vehicle treatment in i). j SKP2i restores autophagic flux in MERS-CoV infected cells. VeroB4 cells were infected with MERS-CoV (MOI = 0.001), treated with SKP2i for 48 h, and incubated with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1, 0.1 \u00b5M) for 2 h before samples were taken at 48 h p.i..
