Polymorphism of MBL and MASP-2 genes may affect the serum concentration of MBL and MASP-2. This study explores the association between MBL and MASP-2 gene polymorphism and their interactions and the susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Method: A total of 503 patients with TB and 419 healthy controls were recruited to participate in this case-control study. PCR-SSP technology was applied to genotype rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes. Demographic data and some exposure information were also obtained from study participants. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between the various factors and TB whilst Marginal Structural Linear Odds Models were used to estimate the interactions. Results: Both genotype GC at rs7096206 of MBL genes and genotype TC at rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (P < 0.05, OR 1.393, 1.302 and 1.426 respectively). The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.282, 1.513) and 1.142 (95% CI: 0.755, 1.530) respectively (P < 0.05).",

            "text": "The impact of MBL gene polymorphism on susceptibility to TB has been reported in different regions and among different races [17] [18] [19] , though the findings are inconsistent between studies. Liu W and colleagues conducted analysis of the six polymorphic sites (A/B, A/C, A/D, H/L, Y/X and P/Q) of MBL genes in the Chinese Han population (including 152 male TB patients and 293 healthy males as controls), and found that only the site H/L was associated with susceptibility to TB [20] . Contrary to this, SHI J and colleagues reported that A/B was associated with susceptibility to TB in the Han population, whilst P/Q was not [21] . Further to these inconsistencies, Soborg and Selvaraj reported that low serum MBL levels could reduce tubercle bacilli infections [18, 19] , whilst other studies found that high of serum MBL levels [22, 23] could reduce tubercle bacilli infections. Although studies have shown that Promoter -221(Y/X) mutation (YX, XX) [22] and HYB haplotype [23] could lead to decreased serum MBL [12, 24] and enhanced susceptibility to TB. Liu Wei and colleagues reported that [20] the promoter -221(Y/X) mutation in the Han population was not associated with susceptibility to TB. No statistically significant difference was observed possibly due to the small sample size, and therefore the need for large sample sizes to explore the association between Y/X (rs7096206) and the susceptibility to TB in the Han population. The polymorphism of MASP-2 genes was also found to be associated with serum protein levels [15, 25, 26] and susceptibility to multiple diseases [27] [28] [29] . If rs2273346 (p.V377A) mutation (TC, CC) can lead to decreased serum MASP-2 concentration, is the mutation associated with susceptibility to TB? The site of rs6695096 is located at intron 7 and it is not clear that the polymorphism of this locus is associated with the susceptibility to TB. This case-control study explores the polymorphism of the rs7096206 of MBL and the rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP2 genes in the Han population in Hunan Province, China, as well as their gene-gene interactions, in order to determine their impact on the susceptibility to TB.",

Previous studies on incidence of TB primarily focused on the tubercle bacilli and impact of environmental risk factors. Over the past years, the impact of host susceptibility genes on disease Recent studies on the association between MBL genes and TB have produced different and even contradictory results. Some studies indicated that the mutation of promoter and exon 1 in MBL genes may lead to the decline of serum MBL level, while a lower serum MBL level can reduce tubercle bacilli infections [18, 19] . Some other studies indicated that higher serum MBL levels can reduce tubercle bacilli infections, while higher serum MBL levels are associated with wild-type MBL genes [22, 33] . Meta-analysis [34] by Denholm and colleagues indicates that polymorphism of MBL genes may be associated with serum MBL level rather than susceptibility to TB. These studies ignored the interactions between genes, as well as certain genetic and environmental factors in the analysis of gene and susceptibility to TB. Moreover, small sample sizes cannot detect real association between MBL genes and TB. Our study included some possible covariates in the logistic regression model for analyzing the relationships between MBL genes and TB, such as sex, age, marital status, educational background, BMI, smoking status, alcohol drinking, tea drinking, BCG vaccination and exposure to kitchen fumes, excluding possible confounding caused by these factors.

Our study reports on the association between MASP-2 gene polymorphism and TB susceptibility. The study has shown that that rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes can increase susceptibility to TB, possibly because the mutation of rs2273346 (p.V377A) (TC, CC) and rs6695096 (TC, CC) can lead to decreased serum MASP-2 concentration and possibly decreased activity of MASP-2, and subsequently impairing the body immune function and increasing the risk of TB. The site of rs6695096 is located at intron7, the mutation of which may affect gene regulation and selective splicing regulation although it will not affect the sequence of amino acids [36, 37] and subsequently affect serum concentration and activity of MASP-2.

There were significant positive interactions between rs7096206 of MBL and both rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2, which suggest that the mutations of both MBL genes and MASP-2 genes can lead to an increased risk of TB.

First, there are six known polymorphisms within MBL-2 that affect the amounts of MBL in human plasma, but we only detected the polymorphism of rs7096206. We could therefore not analyze the impact of other polymorphisms and haplotypes of MBL gene on TB susceptibility. Secondly, we did not test for the association between rs6695096 and MASP-2, and did not find any laboratory evidence in literature to support such association. Thirdly, cases and controls in our study were sampled from different regions. However, all the participants have been limited to Han Chinese, and all the possible impacts of non-genetic factors such as sex, age, marital status, educational background, BMI, smoking status, alcohol drinking, tea drinking, and so on, were adjusted. So the results observed in our study should be reliable.",
