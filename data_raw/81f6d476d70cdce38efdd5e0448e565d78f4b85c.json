In this study, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of mouse whole blood during blood-stage infections of two strains of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi that differ in virulence. We identified several transcriptomic signatures associated with the virulent infection, including signatures for platelet aggregation, stronger and prolonged anemia and lung inflammation. The first two signatures were detected prior to pathology. The anemia signature indicated deregulation of host erythropoiesis, and the lung inflammation signature was linked to increased neutrophil infiltration, more cell death and greater parasite sequestration in the lungs. This comparative whole-blood transcriptomics profiling of virulent and avirulent malaria shows the validity of this approach to inform severity of the infection and provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms.",

Most of these deaths were due to complicated symptoms, such as cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and abnormalities in blood coagulation (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/disease. html). Both host and parasite factors influence clinical outcomes of malaria. In a study conducted in a Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infected population in Sri Lanka, only 30% of variations in disease severity could be explained by known factors, among which were prior exposure, host genetics and other host non-genetic factors 1 . The fact that 70% remained unexplained suggests a strong contribution of parasite virulence and its interaction with the host.",

A more severe RBC loss with a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration was observed in CB infection at 10 days post infection (dpi) compared to that in AS infected mice, agreeing with previous observations, which showed more severe anemia in CB infected BALB/c mice 4 . Moreover, the RBC loss in CB infected mice is longer lasting, even after the peak of infection at 12 dpi (Fig. 1d,e) . In addition, at 10 dpi, CB infected mice showed greater temperature and weight loss (Fig. 1f,g) . Virulent CB and avirulent AS strains of P. c. chabaudi induce distinct responses in host whole blood transcriptome. To investigate whether AS and CB parasites induce different host responses that might contribute to the differences in severity of the blood-stage infection we carried out genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of whole blood during the acute phase of infection. Peripheral blood was collected into Tempus tubes via cardiac puncture from C57BL/6 mice infected with AS or CB at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 dpi.

At any of the post-infection time points examined, there were 6226 differentially expressed transcripts with a greater than 2-fold change in the infected mice compared to the na\u00efve mice (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Consistent with correlation analyses of unfiltered transcripts (Fig. 2a) , only a few transcripts were differentially expressed at 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 2b) . Strikingly, at 6 dpi, a large majority of transcripts were down-regulated compared to na\u00efve controls in both AS and CB infections. However, the number was greater in CB infected mice compared to AS (AS 1856 out of 2265 transcripts, CB 4306 out of 4471 transcripts) (Fig. 2b) . The number of down-regulated transcripts increased steadily from 6 to 12 dpi in AS infection (Fig. 2b) . While down-regulation of transcripts was also observed at 6-8 dpi in the CB infection, the level of down-regulation was significantly lower at 10 dpi and there was a sudden up-regulation of transcripts occurred only in CB infected mice at this time point (Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. 1a ), a critical time point when infected animals were either recovering from acute infection or suffering from severe pathologies leading to death (Fig. 1) , indicating that these up-regulated transcripts may relate to the manifestation of severe pathology in the CB infection. Indeed this higher level of transcriptional up-regulation was further confirmed in 4 CB infected mice that had reached humane end points at 9 dpi ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). This up-or down-regulation of gene expression in whole blood are due to both the leukocyte population changes and transcript regulation during the infection ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ).",

The mean normalised intensity of these 21 genes was significantly down-regulated compared to na\u00efve controls, and CB infected mice had even significantly lower values (Fig. 5b) . The peak activation Z scores calculated by IPA for this anemia signature of CB infection was 1.6-fold higher compared with that of AS (Fig. 5c , 3.6 vs 2.2, 6 dpi), agreeing with the more severe RBC loss (area under the curve analysis) in CB than AS infection (1.5-fold, 36.0 vs 23.5) (Fig. 1d) . Interestingly, at 8 dpi, 13 out of the 21 genes within this signature were already up-regulated in AS infections compared to na\u00efve controls; by contrast, the majority (15) of these genes were still down-regulated in the blood of CB infected mice (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The activation Z score was \u2212 2.0 in AS infected mice indicating anemia alleviation at this time point, compared to that of 2.0 in CB infected mice (Fig. 5c ), which indicates a longer-lasting anemia. This is consistent with the more severe RBC and hemoglobin loss in CB infection at 10 dpi compared to AS (Fig. 1d,e) . Moreover, in support of this data, IPA Canonical Pathway Analysis of heme biosynthesis II pathway also showed that genes in this pathway were more down-regulated or less up-regulated in CB than in AS infected mice at 8 dpi compared to na\u00efve controls (Fig. 5d ). Together, these data suggest a deregulated or stressed erythropoietic response in CB infected mice, leading to a stronger and prolonged severe anemia (Fig. 1d ,e).",

We therefore investigated whether this lung inflammation signature was reflected by more severe lung pathology in CB infected animals. Lungs isolated from systemically perfused CB infected animals were of a darker coloration than lungs of uninfected or AS infected mice (Fig. 6a) .

We therefore investigated whether the up-regulation of MRP14 transcript in the blood is associated with higher protein level and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. We analysed the concentration of MRP14 protein in the serum at 9 dpi.

We next measured the amount of MRP14 in the whole lung lysates, and found that CB infected mice contained more than twice the amount of MRP14 protein compared to that of lungs of AS infected mice at 9 dpi; moreover, this upregulation was observed as early as 6 dpi (Fig. 6g) . IFNg, IL6, KC (CXCL1) and LIX (CXCL5) were higher in the lungs of CB infected mice, indicating a heightened proinflammatory response in the CB infection ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ).

This observation suggested a higher level of sequestration/accumulation of iRBC in the lungs of CB infected mice. To investigate the level of sequestration of iRBCs in P. c. chabaudi AS and CB infected mice, we generated transgenic parasites, PccASluc 230p and PccCBluc 230p , expressing luciferase constitutively throughout the Plasmodium life cycle under the control of eef1a promoter (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). At day 4, 6 and 9 dpi, the total parasite load was determined by measuring luciferase activity from 2 \u03bc L tail blood when the parasites were at late trophozoite stage 8 , and the level of sequestration in different organs was investigated during schizogony. Consistent with the peripheral load of iRBC (Fig. 1b) , there were no significant differences in luciferase activity between PccASluc 230p and PccCBluc 230p infected mice at 6 dpi either in peripheral blood or by whole body imaging (Fig. 7b) . After intensive systemic perfusion, the luciferase activities in isolated organs were measured and relative ratio of sequestration was calculated as the level of luciferase activity per organ (total flux per second) relative to the total parasite load measured in peripheral blood before schizogony (relative light unit, RLU) (Fig. 7c) . Consistent with previous findings 8 , both AS and CB iRBC, sequester/accumulate mainly in the spleen, liver and lungs, with no significant signals observed in the kidney or brain. The relative levels of sequestration/accumulation in the spleen and liver were similar between AS and CB infections. By contrast, a significantly higher level of sequestration in the lungs occurred in the CB infection at 6 dpi, and the trend was still maintained at 9 dpi (Fig. 7c) . The higher level of sequestration/accumulation of schizonts in the lungs is consistent with the observation of greater amounts of Hz in the lungs of CB infected mice compared to AS infected mice (Fig. 7a ).",

These observations of association between infection severity and platelets aggregation suggest that similar mechanisms underlie pathology in both the P. c. chabaudi model of malaria and in human infections, and the experimental model may be useful to explore the underlying mechanisms. It would be of great interest to analyse the platelet aggregation signature in human malarial infections and investigate whether this transcriptomic signature could be used as an early marker to predict development of severe pathology.",

Although sequestration of P. c. chabaudi AS parasites in lungs has been documented 8 , lung damage has not been previously reported for this experimental model. We confirmed that this SARS-related lung inflammation signature in the blood was indeed associated with a more severe pulmonary neutrophilic infiltration and more cell death in the lungs in CB infections. Furthermore, it was linked to a higher level of sequestration of CB iRBC in this organ. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax can sequester within the pulmonary microvasculature and cause lethal malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS) 13 . Members of the PfEMP1 family (P. falciparum Erythocyte Membrane Protein-1) of variant surface-expressed parasite proteins have been shown as parasite ligands mediating parasite cytoadherence 14 . Although PfEMP1 is lacking in other Plasmodium parasites, another multigene family PIR (Plasmodium interspersed repeat) is present in most, if not all, species of Plasmodium; and there is evidence that some PIRs in P. vivax bind to ICAM-1 endothelial receptor in vitro 15 . It is possible that differential PIRs expression between P. c. chabaudi AS and CB is responsible for this differential pulmonary sequestration ability. However, it is also possible that AS parasite is removed more effectively from the lung than CB due to the higher inflammation caused by CB infection.",

There is evidence that Hz can directly induce pulmonary proinflammatory responses 16 . In addition it has been shown that parasite-derived microparticles can induce macrophage activation in a TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-MyD88 dependent manner 17 . In our study, CB infection induced higher level of inflammation (IFNg, IL-6 and MRP14) in the lungs of infected mice. MRP14 (S100A9) is one of the top up-regulated genes identified in the lung inflammation signagure. Together with S100A8 (MRP8), MRP8/14 forms a heterodimer complex that has previously been shown to be a potent chemotactic factor for myeloid cells, especially neutrophils 18 . MRP8/14 are TLR4 ligands and are recognized as damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMP) involved in many inflammatory diseases and infections 19 . For example, in tuberculosis and influenza infection, MRP8/14 is shown to exacerbate pro-inflammatory responses, cell-death and pathogenesis 20, 21 . Of relevance here, MRP14 protein is significantly increased in P. falciparum and P. vivax infected patients 22, 23 . Interestingly, in our P. c. chabaudi mouse model, MRP14 was detectable in all mice infected with the virulent CB strain; by contrast, it was detectable in only 40% of mice infected with the avirulent AS strain. Moreover, when MRP14 was detected in AS infected mice, it was present at significantly lower level than that in CB infected mice. This coincided with a significantly higher number of MRP14 hi Ly6G + neutrophils in the lungs of CB infected mice. It is possible that MRP14 + cells respond to the microparticles upon rupture of sequestered CB schizonts, leading to proinflammatory response and recruiting more MRP14 + neutrophils. Our analysis offers evidence that different parasite strains, exhibiting different sequestration tendencies, can lead to different levels of lung inflammation and damage.",

Bioluminescence was assessed with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified with the TECAN Safire2 plate reader and Magellan software (Tecan).

The brain, lungs, liver, spleen, left kidney and gut were removed immediately and luciferase assessed using in vivo Imaging System IVIS Lumina (Xenogen), with a 10 cm field of view, a binning factor of 4, and an exposure time of 10 s. Bioluminescence (Total flux per second) was quantified with the software Living Image (Xenogen) by adjusting a region of interest to the shape of each organ. To account for the influence of total parasite load on the number of parasites sequestered in the organs, bioluminescence in the organs was normalized to total parasite load. Luciferase activities measured in the organs were divided by parasite load in 2 \u03bc l blood (see above), allowing comparison between mice with different parasite burdens.",
