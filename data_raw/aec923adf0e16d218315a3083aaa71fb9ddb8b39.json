            "text": "Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with ''normal'' expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.",

Endemic infections have been shown to have important effects on survival [1, 2] and reproduction [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and the theoretical potential to regulate populations and drive abundance cycles [8, 9] . At the same time there are many documented instances of epidemics associated with catastrophic mortality in nature [10, 11, 12] , although the observation of such events may often be serendipitous or depend on the focus of the researcher. Increasingly it is also appreciated that co-occurring pathogens should be regarded as a potential community [13, 14] , whose interactions may define the consequences of infection for the individual host and host population [15] . In general, however, ecological studies of microbial infectious disease in nature are constrained to the analysis of a single pathogen or an ad hoc panel of pathogens for which there is a priori knowledge, a preconception of possible importance and specific diagnostic reagents.",

Mice were caught by overnight live-trapping using Longworth traps. The traps were placed at permanently marked stations located at 20 m intervals (1 trap/station) along a 1600 m curvilinear transect that traced the margins of contiguous forestry blocks. These blocks were separated along their edges by narrow clear areas ,10-40 m wide. The use of an extended trapping line was intended to distribute trapping effort over a very large area and avoid local demographic effects. Traps were set in the afternoon (16.00 h BST) and collected the following morning (08.00 h) throughout the study period. Females that were lactating or heavily pregnant at the time of capture were released. At the last two sampling points, where numbers of mice captured exceeded the capacity to process them, some randomly selected individuals were also released. Other individuals were processed and infection variables quantified as previously described [18] . This was with the exception that in the present study lice were recorded in different infection categories (absent, ,50 egg cases present, $50 egg cases present). Additionally, in the present study, thin blood smears were prepared from cardiac blood and examined for the presence of Bartonella spp. and Babesia microti (counts of infected cells in one hundred 1006 microscope fields). Eyes from each specimen were stored in 4% formalin and then lenses were removed and dried in an oven at 80uC for 72 h and weighed for use as an index of age (combined weight, g) [19] . In the present study the same set of macroparasites was found as in a previous study along the same transect in 2007 [18] , with the exception that Heterakis spumosa was absent.",

Total RNA was extracted from cells stored in RNAlaterH using an Ambion RNAqueousH-Micro kit (AM1931) and converted to cDNA using an Applied Biosystems High capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (4387406). All samples were DNase-treated and periodic controls lacking a reverse transcriptase enzymatic step indicated that DNA contamination was negligible. Real-time PCR primers for the cytokines, transcription factor and endogenous control genes were designed from conserved regions identified in multiple alignments of rodent sequences in the NCBI database. For TLR genes de novo amplification and sequencing of a larger (300-500 bp) fragment was first carried out using conserved primers (designed as above). Real-time PCR primers were then designed from the resulting Apodemus sylvaticus TLR sequence. All primers were designed with Primer 3 v. 0.4.0. For each target and endogenous control gene 2-6 primer pairs were designed and trialled and the optimal set selected for further use. All selected primers (Table 1) were confirmed to be specific by re-sequencing of the target fragment, did not produce confounding primer dimers under assay conditions and had approximately equal efficiencies close to 100%, based on the average of 5-fold dilution series repeated on multiple different plates. Target genes were normalized against the endogenous control gene b-actin. This was the most stable endogenous control gene amongst a set of 9 candidates considered (including c-actin, G6PDH, GAPDH, HPRT1, Tubulin, YWHAZ, 18 s and Albumin) as determined by stepwise exclusion of those with low stability estimated by the M statistic [27] . This procedure was conducted separately for 10 LPS-, HKLM-or ODN 2006-stimulated cultures randomly selected out of a pool of 300 culture samples. In all three cases b-actin was identified as the joint most stably expressed gene. The primers used for b-actin were sense 59-AGATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCT -39 and antisense 59-TCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC -39 which gave a 102 bp amplicon. The 96-well real-time PCR assay was designed so that all target genes for one animal were run on a single plate, except for Foxp3 amplifications which were all run on a separate plate. Each target gene reaction and the endogenous control gene reaction were run in duplicate for samples and in triplicate for a reference cDNA that was included on each plate. A no-templatecontrol was included in duplicate for each primer pair. Real-time PCR assays were run using default settings and the manufacturerrecommended enzyme, buffer and SYBR Green reagents on an ABI 7500 Fast machine (Applied Biosystems). ABI 7500 v 2.0.4 software was used to calculate the expression of each target in each sample as a fold difference relative to the reference cDNA by the DDCt method [28] .",

We discovered significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunologicallyrelevant genes, including cytokines and TLRs, in late June (cluster 1) and early September 2008 (cluster 2). This is consistent with the presence of an acute, highly immunogenic microbial infection in the mouse population at these times. Other possible causes for the ''extreme expression'' clusters are considered less likely. Thus, autoimmunity, allergy or malignancy not involving infection does not well explain the clustered temporal epidemiological pattern and poisoning is unlikely because the habitat is managed for pheasant shooting (pheasants would be likely to take poisoned bait placed for rodents) . The pattern seen is also difficult to attribute to handling stress or to ontogenetic or genetic variation. Compared to the non-cluster animals in the present study and to hundreds of other ''normal'' wild rodents (A. sylvaticus and Microtus agrestis) recently analysed in our laboratory in a similar way [16, 18] , the relative mRNA expression ratios for immunological genes and the amount of constitutive TNF-a protein secretion in some cluster animals are unprecedentedly high.

An additional, circumstantial, corollary was that an abrupt turnover between 1 + and 0 + A. sylvaticus cohorts occurred in the weeks following cluster 1, consistent with a perturbation affecting the population at this time. Over an equivalent time interval in the preceding year (2007), clusters of individuals with extreme TNF-a protein expression did not occur ( [18] ; unpublished data) and the turnover between 1 + and 0 + cohorts proceeded much more gradually (Figure 4) .",

Members of both clusters expressed high levels of all immunological genes studied, but cluster 1 was characterized by relatively higher expression of TNF-a at the protein and mRNA level and cluster 2 by higher expression of TLR4 and TLR9 and the regulatory T-helper cell-associated transcription factor FoxP3. These differences may be indicative of more than one infectious agent stimulating different immune responses. Alternatively, different immune responses to the same pathogen may have occurred because the animals involved in the respective clusters were themselves different. Cluster 1 individuals were exclusively over-wintered (1 + ) animals, whilst cluster 2 animals were exclusively young-of-the-year (0 + ) individuals. Phenotypic differences might therefore have arisen from ontogenetic stage variation, or from a different history of programming by environmental cues in the respective cohorts. A further possibility is that animals in the second cluster might have had some level of acquired immunity, following the outbreak earlier in the year, and produced more highly regulated responses indicative of a degree of immunological tolerance. This latter possibility is supported by the fact that some atypical individuals occurred in cluster 1 that were either phenotypically intermediate, or, more similar to cluster 2 individuals (Figure 3 ).",

It is likely such a pathogen could only be maintained by rapid spatial movement through the wider population, via locally unstable dynamics, or by inactive latent infections in some hosts acting as a reservoir and intermittent source of infection through time. One possibility consistent with some of these considerations is cowpox virus, infections with which can show fine-scale temporal clustering in wood mouse populations [36] . However, cowpox virus is known to suppress TNF-a responses [37] , which were expressed at very high levels in cluster 1 mice. Furthermore, field studies of cowpox in UK wild rodents [38, 39] generally indicate that infection levels within populations persist with a much coarser temporal grain than was the case for the tightly focussed episodes of infection recorded here.",

This indicates that healthier individuals with more macroparasites might either be more susceptible to any putative infection or more resilient to the effects of infection. Increased susceptibility could arise because individuals in better condition eat more and range farther, exposing themselves to greater infection risks from macroparasites and microbial infections. Macroparasites might also contribute to susceptibility due to their anti-inflammatory activities [18] . Increased resilience could occur because animals in better starting condition might be more likely to survive infection, thus raising their representation in infected classes by differential mortality. The immunoregulatory influence of macroparasites might also be important in this context: dampening potentially lethal immunopathogenic inflammatory responses. A further possibility is that individual mice respond to infection by adjusting life history traits in a way that produces an overcompensatory response in body condition. For example, A. sylvaticus infected with cowpox virus in summer may show positive effects on survival due to a diversion of resources from reproduction [3] .",

We suggest that such patterns will often be caused by infectious agents and can be used to monitor important infection influences operating on a natural host population. The general approach used here is technically accessible to a wide range of researchers. An obvious extension would also be to combine the present methods with next generation sequencing techniques for the broad detection of microbial pathogens [40, 41] in animals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles compared to ''normal'' animals. In the present example, we focussed on a population of wood mice and were able to detect the probable signatures of epidemic infectious disease outbreaks and their demographic and individual correlates. Given the long standing interest in the dynamics of A. sylvaticus populations in the UK [42, 43, 44, 45] , in particular the apparent slow growth during the earlier part of the breeding season, this study might point towards a possible, destabilizing, role for microbial infectious disease in addition to the factors identified by other authors. There is also a wider significance for the ability of ecologists to analyze the dynamic interaction between pathogen communities and their wildlife hosts and, particularly, to identify unsuspected acute microbial infectious disease outbreaks, whose effects might otherwise be dismissed as generalized environmental noise.",

Differences in body condition and macroparasite burden between cluster 2 and non-cluster animals captured at the same time. A. Cluster 2 animals (dark bar) had significantly better body condition (BW resid ) than non-cluster animals, adjusting for size and stage. B. Cluster 2 animals (dark bar) had greater grouped macroparasite burdens (PC1 P ) than non-cluster animals, adjusting for size and stage. PC1 P represents first principal component scores from a principal components analysis of common macroparasite species at Cotgrave Forest. This principal component accounted for 23% of total variation and showed high loadings of the same sign for most species. It was thus taken to represent the major pattern of positive covariation within the assemblage. Variable coefficients on PC1 P were: Skrjabinotaenia lobata 0.25, Brachylaemus recurvum 0.28, Calodium hepaticum 0.24, Syphacia nigeriana 0.52, Heligmosomoides polygyrus 0.50, Ixodes ricinus 20.040, laelapid mites 0.102, Polyplax serrata 0.52. There were individually significant associations with cluster 2 membership, in the same direction as PC1 P , for P. serrata and S. lobata, adjusting for host size and stage. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020070.g006",

Cluster 2 animals (dark bar) had greater grouped macroparasite burdens (PC1 P ) than non-cluster animals, adjusting for size and stage. PC1 P represents first principal component scores from a principal components analysis of common macroparasite species at Cotgrave Forest. This principal component accounted for 23% of total variation and showed high loadings of the same sign for most species. It was thus taken to represent the major pattern of positive covariation within the assemblage. Variable coefficients on PC1 P were: Skrjabinotaenia lobata 0.25, Brachylaemus recurvum 0.28, Calodium hepaticum 0.24, Syphacia nigeriana 0.52, Heligmosomoides polygyrus 0.50, Ixodes ricinus 20.040, laelapid mites 0.102, Polyplax serrata 0.52.
