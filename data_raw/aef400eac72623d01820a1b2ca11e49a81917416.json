The human health concern was identified as environmentally derived antibioticresistant bacteria (ARB) that may adversely affect human health (e.g., reduced efficacy in clinical anti biotic use, more serious or prolonged infection) either by direct exposure of patients to antibiotic resistant pathogen(s) or by exposure of patients to resistance determinants and subsequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to bacterial pathogen(s) on or within a human host, as conceptualized in Figure 1 . ARB hazards develop in the environment as a result of direct uptake of antibioticresistant genes (ARG) via various mechanisms (e.g., mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, integrons, gene cassettes, or transposons) and/or proliferate under environmental selection caused by anti biotics and coselecting agents such as biocides, toxic metals, and nanomaterial stressors (Qiu et al. 2012; Taylor et al. 2011) , or by gene mutations (Gillings and Stokes 2012) . Depending on the presence of recipient bacteria, these processes generate either environmental antibioticresistant bacteria (eARB) or pathogens with antibioticresistance (pARB) (Figure 1 ).",

In this review we focus on how to apply HHRA to the risk of infec tions with pathogenic ARB because they are an increasing cause of morbidity and mor tality, particularly in developing regions Background: Only recently has the environment been clearly implicated in the risk of antibiotic resistance to clinical outcome, but to date there have been few documented approaches to formally assess these risks. oBjective: We examined possible approaches and sought to identify research needs to enable human health risk assessments (HHRA) that focus on the role of the environment in the failure of anti biotic treatment caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Methods: The authors participated in a workshop held 4-8 March 2012 in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, to define the scope and objectives of an environmental assessment of antibiotic-resistance risks to human health. We focused on key elements of environmental-resistance-development \"hot spots,\" exposure assessment (unrelated to food), and dose response to characterize risks that may improve antibiotic-resistance management options. discussion: Various novel aspects to traditional risk assessments were identified to enable an assessment of environmental antibiotic resistance. These include a) accounting for an added selective pressure on the environmental resistome that, over time, allows for development of antibioticresistant bacteria (ARB); b) identifying and describing rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the relevant environmental \"hot spot\" compartments; and c) modifying traditional dose-response approaches to address doses of ARB for various health outcomes and pathways. conclusions: We propose that environmental aspects of antibiotic-resistance development be included in the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. Because of limited available data, a multicriteria decision analysis approach would be a useful way to undertake an HHRA of environmental antibiotic resistance that informs risk managers. citation: Ashbolt NJ, Am\u00e9zquita A, Backhaus T, Borriello P, Brandt ). An antimicrobial resistant micro organism has the ability to mul tiply or persist in the presence of an increased level of an anti microbial agent compared with a susceptible counter part of the same species. For this review, we limited the resistant group of micro organisms to bacteria and therefore to anti biotic resistance, an area in which the term \"antibiotic\" is used synonymously with \"antibacterial.\" It is important to understand the contribution that the environment has on the development of resistance in both human and animal pathogens because therapeutic resistant infections may lead to longer hos pitalization, longer treatment time, failure of treatment therapy, and the need for treatment with more toxic or costly antibiotics, as well as an increased likelihood of death.",

The environmental consequences from the use and release of anti biotics from various sources (K\u00fcmmerer 2009a (K\u00fcmmerer , 2009b and the HGT of antibioticresistance genes (ARG) between indigenous environmental and pathogenic bacteria and their resistance determinants (B\u00f6rjesson et al. 2009; Chagas et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2011; Cummings et al. 2011; Forsberg et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2012; Qiu et al. 2012 ) has yet to be quanti fied, but is of global concern (Finley et al. 2013; WHO 2012a) . The genetic elements encoding for the ability of micro organisms to withstand the effects of an anti microbial agent are located either chromosomally or extra chromosomally and may be associated with mobile genetic elements such as plas mids, integrons, gene cassettes, or transpo sons, thereby enabling horizontal and vertical transmission from resistant to previously susceptible strains. From an HHRA point of view, the emergence of ARB in source and drinking water (De Boeck et al. 2012; Isozumi et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2013 ) further highlights the need to place these emerging environmental risks in perspective. Yet, assess ing the range of environmental contribu tions to anti biotic resistance may not only be complicated by lack of quantitative data but also by the need to coordinate efforts across different agencies that may have jurisdiction over environmental risks versus human and animal health.",

Further, the use of anti microbials in crops, animals, and humans provides a continued entry of anti biotics to the environment, along with pos sible novel genes and ARB. A summary of the fate, transport, and persistence of antibiotics and resistance genes after land application of waste from food animals that received antibiotics or following outflow to surface water from sewage treatment has emphasized the need to better understand the environ mental mechanisms of genetic selection and gene acquisition as well as the dynamics of resistance genes (resistome) and their bacte rial hosts (CheeSanford et al. 2009; Crtryn 2013) . For example, the presence of anti biotic residues in water from pharma ceuti cal manufacturers in certain parts of the world (Fick et al. 2009 ), ponds receiving intensive animal wastes (Barkovskii et al. 2012) , aqua culture waters (Shah et al. 2012) , and sewage outfalls (Dolejska et al. 2011 ) are important sources, among others, leading to the pres ence of ARG in surface waters. In particu lar, the comparatively high concentrations of anti biotics found in the effluent of pharma ceuti cal production plants have been asso ciated with an increased presence of ARG in surface waters (Kristiansson et al. 2011; Li et al. 2009 Li et al. , 2010 . Most recently, 100% sequence identity of ARG from a diverse set of clinical pathogens and common soil bacte ria (Forsberg et al. 2012 ) has highlighted the potential for environ mental HGT between eARB and pARB.",

This exceedingly rare event that results in the transfer of a novel (to clinically important bacteria) resistance gene from a harmless environmental bacterium to a pathogen need happen only once if a human is the recipient of the novel pARB. Unlike the emergence of SARS (severe acute respira tory syndrome) and similar viruses where, in hindsight, the risk factors are now well under stood (Swift et al. 2007 ), the conditions for a \"onetime event\" could occur in a range of \"normal\" habitats. Once developed, the resis tant bacterium/gene has a possibility to spread between humans around the world [such as seen with the spread of NDM1 (New Delhi metallobetalactamase1) resistance (Wilson and Chen 2012) ], promoted by our use of anti biotics. Although it seems very difficult to quantify the probability for such a rare event (including assessing the probability for where it will happen and when), there is consider able value in trying to identify the risk factors (such as pointing out critical environments for HGT to occur, or identifying pharmaceutical exposure levels that could cause selection pres sures and hence increase the abundance of a given gene). After such a critical HGT event, we may then move into a more quantitative kind of HHRA. The overall goal of the workshop (Anti microbial Resistance in the Environment: Assessing and Managing Effects of Anthropogenic Activities) was to identify the significance of ARB within the environment and to map out some of the complexities involved in order to identify research gaps and provide statements on the level of scientific understanding of various ARB issues. A broad range of international delegates, including aca demics, government regulators, industry mem bers, and clinicians, discussed various issues. The focus of this review arose from discussions of improving our understanding of human health risks-in addition to epidemiological studies-by developing HHRAs to explore potential risks and inform risk manage ment. Because the end goal of an assessment depends on the context (e.g., research, regulation), we provide a generic approach to under taking an HHRA of environmental ARB that can be adapted to the users' interest (conceptualized in Figure 1 ). Given the many uncertainties, we also highlight identified research gaps.",

The consensus of workshop participants was that manage ment could best be applied at points of anti biotic manufacturing and use, agricultural operations including aquaculture, and wastewater treat ment plants (Pruden et al. 2013) . Assessing the relative impact of managing any particular part of a system is hampered by the lack of knowledge on the relative importance of each part of the system for the overall risk. That is, as recently stated by the WHO (2013), \"AMR is a complex problem driven by many inter connected factors so single, isolated interventions have little impact and coordi nated actions are required.\" Hence, a start ing point for an assessment of environmental anti bioticresistance risks intended to aid risk management is a theo retical risk assessment pathway based on a) local surveillance data on the occurrence and types of anti biotics used in human medi cine, crop production, animal husbandry, and companion animals; b) infor mation on ARG and ARB in the various environmental compartments (in particular, soil and aquatic systems including drinking water); and c) related disease information. This assessment should be amended by discussion with the relevant stakeholders, which requires extensive risk communication and could form part of the multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach discussed in detail below. As a result of the workshop, Pruden et al. (2013) also advocate coupling environ mental manage ment and mitigation plans with tar geted surveillance and monitoring efforts in order to judge the relative impact and success of the interventions.",

Thus, the key issue is how experi mental and modeling approaches can be used to derive estimates. Furthermore, haz ard concentration, time, and environ mental compartmentdependent aspects should also be taken into account. First, the current understanding is that for nonmutation derived antibiotic resistance to develop in environmental bacteria (including pathogens that may actively grow outside of hosts) to develop into eARB/pARB ( Figure 1 , pro cesses 1 and 2), a selective pressure (i.e., pres ence of anti biotics or antibioticresistance determinants) must be maintained over time in the presence of ARG; for existing pARB released into the environment, sur vival in environmental media is the critical factor. However, the exact mechanisms and quantitative relationships between selective pressures and ARB development have yet to be elucidated, and they may be different depending on the anti biotic, bacterial spe cies, and resistance mechanisms involved. In cases where selective pressure is removed, the abundance of antibioticresistance ARB may be reduced, but not to extinction. Hughes 2010, 2011; Cottell et al. 2012) . Even a small number of ARB at the com munity level represents a reservoir of ARG for horizontal transfer once pressure is reap plied. Because it seems inevitable that ARB will eventually develop against any anti biotic (Levy and Marshall 2004) , the key manage ment aim seems to be to delay and confine such a development as much as possible.",

Each of these fecal and environmental pathogens is well known to be able to acquire ARG; thus, given further data on environmen tal HGT rates, they could be used as refer ence pathogens in microbial risk assessments.

To properly charac terize human risks, it is typical to select hazards for which there are dose-response health data described either deterministically or stochastically, as available for the refer ence enteric pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, E. coli) (Schoen and Ashbolt 2010) , but these dose-response health data have yet to be quantified for the skin/wound reference pathogens (Mena and Gerba 2009; Rose and Haas 1999) . However, as noted above for processes 1-5, (Figure 1 ), an important difference for ARB is the need to account for the phenomena associated with selective environmental pressures for the development of ARB, and ultimately that form the human infective dose of either eARB or pARB. The exact mechanisms and doseresponse relationships have yet to be eluci dated, and may be different depending on the bacterial species and resistance mechanisms involved. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable for the non compromised human exposed to a pARB to fit the published dose-response/ infection relationship (e.g., derived from \"feeding\" trials with healthy adults or from information collected during outbreak inves tigations) for strains of the same pathogen without antibiotic resistance. What appears more limiting are dose-response models that describe the probability of illness based on the conditional probability of infection and including people who are already compro mised, such as those under going anti biotic therapy. Although there is definitive data on pARB being more pathogenic or causing more severe illness than their antimicrobial susceptible equivalents (Barza 2002; Helms et al. 2004 Helms et al. , 2005 Travers and Barza 2002) , that may not always be the case (Evans et al. 2009; Wassenaar et al. 2007) . Clear examples of excess mortality include associ ated blood stream infections for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and from third generation cephalosporinresistant E. coli (G3CREC). In 2007 in participating European countries, 27,711 cases of MRSA were associated with 5,503 excess deaths and 255,683 excess hospital days, and 15,183 epi sodes of G3CREC blood stream infections were responsible for 2,712 excess deaths and 120,065 extra hospital days (de Kraker et al. 2011) . The authors predicted that the combined burden of resistance of MRSA and G3CREC will likely lead to a pre dicted incidence of 3.3 associated deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. Yet for many regions of the world, such predictions are less well understood.",

MCDA is a wellestablished tool that can be used for evaluating and document ing the importance assigned to different fac tors in ranking risks (Lienert et al. 2011) , albeit heavily dependent on expert opinion. In the context of MRA, MCDA has been used to rank foodborne microbial risks based on multiple factors, including public health, market impacts, consumer perception and acceptance, and social sensitivity (Ruzante et al. 2010) , as well as to prioritize and select inter ventions to reduce pathogen exposures (Fazil et al. 2008) . Examples of MCDA applications in structuring decisions for man aging eco toxico logi cal risks have also been reported (Linkov et al. 2006; Semenzin et al. 2008 ) and provide useful MCDA approaches. MCDA could be used, for example, to evalu ate and rank the relative risks between habi tats highly polluted with anti biotics, ARG, and ARG determinants, as described above for possible hot spots for HGT and develop ment of ARB. MCDA could be applied to evaluate the relative contribution of coselect ing agents (e.g., detergents, biocides, met als, nano materials) from various sources to the overall risk of ARB in the environment. Moreover, for a range of anti biotics consid ered to be of environmental concern, MCDA approaches could be used for risk ranking according to criteria based on relevant con tributing factors (e.g., mobility of resistance determinants in genetic elements, antibiotic resistance transfer rates in different environ mental compartments, accumulation levels of anti biotics in environmental compartments, environmental fate and transport to expo sure points). In the MCDA process, it is also important to identify low probability but high impact \"onetimeevent\" types of risk.",

Selection at sub inhibitory concen trations and assay development for environ mental matrices are key areas of research that need to be addressed. However, overall care is needed when interpreting ex situ studies and extrapolating to in situ environmental condi tions, as well as in dealing with illdefined hazard mixtures in the environment.

Hot spots, locations where a highlevel of HGT and anti biotic resistance develop, may, for instance, include aquatic environments affected by pharma ceutical industry effluents, aqua culture, or sewage discharges, as well as terrestrial environments affected by the deposition of biosolids or animal manures. The degree of persistence of anti biotic resistance (i.e., the rate by which resistance disappears without having an environ mental selection pressure for resistance) must also be considered for risk assessment and will depend on the fit ness cost of resistance. However, the fitness costs within complex and variable environ ments are difficult to assess. Furthermore, standard methods have not been developed for evaluating environ mental selection pres sures in complex microbial communities, but several experimental approaches are possible and have been described elsewhere (Berg et al. 2010; Brandt et al. 2009 ).",

In the absence of fully quantitative data to undertake a HHRA, riskranking approaches based on exposure assessment modeling could be adopted and developed to inform allocation of resources for data generation as part of an HHRA of ARB. Evers et al. (2008) presented one such approach in the context of food safety for estimating the relative contribution of Campylobacter spp. sources and transmis sion routes on exposure per personday in the Netherlands. Their study included 31 transmis sion routes related to direct contact with animals and ingestion of food and water, and resulted in a ranking of the most significant sources of exposure. Although their study focused on foodborne transmission routes and did not deal with anti bioticresistant Campylobacter strains, a similar approach could be applied to estimate human exposure to ARB hazards using the environmental exposure pathways described by Evers et al. (2008) . This would require data on the prevalence of ARG and ARB, as well as lev els of anti biotics present in all exposure routes to be considered in the risk assessment. Although such an approach is probably not currently fea sible, improved environmental data for a select number of pathogen-gene combinations could be developed in the future.",

Furthermore, many current risk management schemes start the process from a management perspec tive and delve into quantitative assessments as needed in order to improve risk manage ment actions, such as in the WHO water safety plans (WHO 2009) . We propose that environmental aspects of anti bioticresistance development be included in the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. In general terms, an MRA appears suitable to address environ mental human health risks posed by the envi ronmental release of anti biotics, ARB, and ARG; however, at present, there are still too many data gaps to realize that goal. Further development of this type of approach requires data mining from previous epidemiological studies to aid in model development, param eterization, and validation, as well as in the collection of new information, particularly that related to conditions and rates of ARB development in various hot spot environ ments, and for various human health doseresponse unknowns identified in this review. In the nearterm, options likely to provide a firstpass assessment of risks seem likely to be based on MCDA approaches, which could be facilitated by Bayesian network models. Once these MRA models gain more acceptance, they may facilitate scenario testing to deter mine which control points may be most effec tive in reducing risks and which riskdriving attributes should be specifically considered and minimized during the development of novel anti biotics.",
