Immune responses play a critical role in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis: infection is associated with an early loss of lymphocytes and down-regulation of interferon production and actions. There is subsequent dysregulation of coagulation, leading to clinically important hemorrhage in a minority of patients. The genus ebolavirus includes 5 different viruses: Sudan virus, Tai Forest virus, EBOV, Reston virus and Bundibugyo virus. EBOV has the highest fatality rate -57-90%. Data from human infections with EBOV are limited, but the evidence from previous outbreaks suggests that the innate immune response is predictive of outcome. Specifically, an early and transient proinflammatory cytokine response, including IFN-\u03b1, is associated with survival, yet a sustained and increasing pro-inflammtory cytokine response, with dendritic cell infection that abrogates the IFN response, is associated with death (1, 2) . Notably, in the absence of a robust innate immune response, including IFN\u03b1 activation of dendritic cells, the adaptive immune response (B and T cell activation) is severely impaired, leading to failure of control of viral replication and poor outcome.",

Type I IFNs mediate diverse biological effects, including the largely species-specific but cell type-independent antiviral responses, and several cell typerestricted responses of immunological relevance. IFNs modulate both T and B lymphocyte responses by promoting the proliferation of memory T cells, promoting the differentiation of Th1 cells, inducing IFN\u03b3 secretion from T cells, and promoting isotype switching in B cells and differentiation into plasma cells. IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 upregulate MHC class I. Moreover, IFNs activate macrophages, activate and enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells, and regulate the maturation and terminal differentiation of dendritic cells. IFNs have widespread potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of viral infections, and are currently administered for chronic hepatitis B and C (HCV) infections. IFNs inhibit viral infection by preventing viral entry into target cells and by blocking different stages of the viral replicative cycle for different viruses. Type I IFNs have a critical role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral challenge. IFNs\u03b1/\u03b2 regulate the activities of other cytokines and their receptors, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, IL-1 receptor, IL-2, IL-3, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-18 etc, and chemokines such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and the chemokine receptor, CCR5.",

Indeed, viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies specifically targeted against an IFN response, confirming the importance of IFNs as antivirals. This immune evasion strategy is relevant when one considers IFN treatment for EBOV infection (3, 4) . Experimental data indicate that EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35 inhibit host cell systems that lead to IFN production and also inhibit events associated with an IFN response. EBOV VP35 effectively blocks IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by either RIG-I or MDA5 (5) . Indeed, specific effector molecules of an IFN response have been shown to directly inhibit EBOV entry into cells and release of viral progeny from cells, effectively preventing viral spread. Treating EBOV infected individuals with IFN may therefore override the inhibitory effects of EBOV infection on IFN production, but the challenge remains to administer treatment early post-exposure, before the viral burden is such that IFN responsiveness would be disabled. IFN-\u03b12 has has been approved by the USFDA for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma, and hepatitis B. In combination with ribavirin, different IFN-\u03b12 preparations and Infergen (IFN-alfacon-1) have been approved by the USFDA for hepatitis C infection (and are currently being evaluated in HIV infection). Estimates of 40% sustained virologic response against HCV genotype 1 and 70% against genotypes 2 and 3, using the pegylated IFN-\u03b1s in combination with ribavirin, provide evidence for the therapeutic benefits of IFNs-\u03b1 as antivirals.",

Notably, when rhesus macaques were administered an antibody against one of the IFN receptor subunits, IFNAR1, on days 2 and 5 after virus inoculation, there was increased viremia and earlier progression to death (6). 3. IFN \u03b2-1a therapy in rhesus macaques: at 10.5 \u00b5g/kg starting at 18 hours after virus inoculation and continuing to 9 days, prolonged time to death from EBOV. 35 \u00b5g/kg starting 1 hour post virus inoculation and daily for 14 days, led to survival of 1/3 from MARV infection (6). 4. IFN-\u03b12b therapy in cynomologous macaques: at 2 x 10 7 IU/kg im starting at 18 hours after virus inoculation and daily, reduced viremia (7). 5. Adenovirus expressing IFN-\u03b1 enhances the protective efficacy of mAbs in NHP when administered after onset of symptoms (8). Notably, in all the nonhuman primate studies where either an IFN-\u03b2 or an IFN-\u03b1 or the adenoviral vectored-Infergen gene was administered, there are 3 considerations that may account for the limited therapeutic benefit that was observed: 1. The challenge dose of EBOV was 1000 PFU by intramuscular route of inoculation. Both the route of inoculation and the significantly high lethal challenge dose may distinguish course of infection in the nonhuman primates compared with the current human EBOV disease. Of note, the illness in nonhuman primates is more rapid in progression and more lethal than that seen in humans. 2. IFN dosing. In contrast to current dosing for therapeutic efficacy against HCV (and for multiple sclerosis), doing regimens employed for these published nonhuman primate studies were of the order of 10-100 fold greater (mg/kg). This raises the issue of invoking adverse events that may undermine the potential therapeutic benefit of dosing that might reflect what will be used in humans i.e. survival may have been compromised in these studies. 3. Differences in the innate and adaptive immune responses between nonhuman primates and humans. While some of the rhesus IFN-\u03b1 subtypes are homologous to the corresponding human sequences (IFN-\u03b11/13, \u03b12, \u03b16, \u03b18, \u03b114, and \u03b116), 7 others have a partial homology to human IFN-\u03b14, \u03b116, or \u03b121, and have been termed IFN-\u03b123 to IFN-\u03b129 (11) . TLR7 and TLR9 agonists mediate distinct type I IFN responses in humans and nonhuman primates in vitro and in vivo (12) . Differences in Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles between humans and nonhuman primates also exist (13) . Nonhuman primates are more sensitive to vaccines than humans (14) .",

Three major types of interferons have been defined: type I (IFN-alpha, beta, epsilon, kappa and omega), type II (IFN-gamma) and type III (IFN-lambda). Interferon-beta is a member of the type I subset of interferons. The type I interferons have considerably overlapping but also distinct biologic activities. The bioactivities of all IFNs, including IFN-beta, are induced via their binding to specific receptors on the surface of human cells. Differences in the bioactivites induced by the three major subtypes of IFNs likely reflect differences in the signal transduction pathways induced by signaling through their cognate receptors.",

Examination of serum samples from infected individuals during the 2000 outbreak of Sudan EBOV in Uganda revealed that surviving patients had significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 within the first few days of the onset of critical illness (1). 9. Evidence that circulating levels of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 are only detectable 4 days after virus inoculation of cynomologous macaques, likely delayed because of virus infecting dendritic cells (10). This delay in the IFN-inducible immune response likely contributes to the virulence of infection. 10. Availability of stocks of FDA-approved IFNs.",

Since this is a pilot study, it is important to have such a protocol in readiness so that, new cases can be immediately enrolled. It is estimated that during a wave, it will be possible to recruit 30 participants, in less than one month. It is planned to propose the study to be conducted at other treatment centres across West Africa. The rationale is to increase the rate of enrolment for the pilot study so that if a potential benefit is detected early, IFN \u03b2-1a therapy can be evaluated",
