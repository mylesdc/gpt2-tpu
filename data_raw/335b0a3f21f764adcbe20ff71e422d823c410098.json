We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5-0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [$1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5-1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [$1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6-4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [$5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals' odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality.",

We screened for exposure to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus type-1 (CAV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine herpesvirus (CHV), all of which can inflict morbidity and mortality in canids (Table S1 ) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In wolves, we also screened for exposure to Neospora caninum, a protozoan parasite whose life cycle includes canids, the definitive hosts where sexual reproduction takes place, and ungulates, the intermediate hosts [20, 21] . N. caninum is transmitted between canids and ungulates when a canid consumes infected ungulate tissue. N. caninum reproduces in the canid's intestines, and oocysts are shed in feces and then consumed by ungulates through contaminated forage and water. N. caninum infection can cause high rates of abortion in cattle, and thus is a pathogen of special interest to the local ranching community.",

Not all monitored dens were visible from the air or ground, so we did not always have pup counts to match the serological results from a particular pack to directly test the relationship between seroprevalence and survival. Therefore, while the strength of inference was reduced, we used regression analyses to examine the relationship between annual wolf-pup survival and annual wolf-pup seroprevalence (n = 11 years of estimates), broken down by location (i.e., NR and Interior).",

Small samples reduced our accuracy and precision in estimating exposure rates as well as our power to detect significant differences in exposure between groups, hence limiting the strength of our inferences based on our data. This is particularly apparent in our analysis of CDV exposure, where our supported models included many estimable parameters. However, in some cases, small samples were unavoidable. For example, in 1999 and 2005, pup survival was so poor that only 13 and 8 pups, respectively, were known to be alive on the NR, making it very difficult to capture pups in those years. Our conclusions must further be qualified by the fact that our serological assays were not specifically validated or optimized for wolves, coyotes, or foxes. Without knowing the sensitivity and specificity of our tests for these species, we do not know the degree to which our positive and negative test results reflect true exposure status. We cannot rule out, for example, false positive results caused by non-specific antibody binding or exposure to closely related or cross-reacting viruses. However, there is good biological reason to believe that wolf and coyote immune systems would behave very similarly to those of closely related domestic dogs, for which the tests have been optimized. Previous serological work with foxes (including CDV assay validation via vaccination trials) suggests our titer cutoffs were appropriate for this species as well [32] . Furthermore, the fact that multiple species exhibited similar patterns of exposure suggests that we did detect 'real' signals of disease exposure.",

Contrary to our original hypothesis, resident coyotes tended to have a greater probability of pathogen exposure than their transient counterparts. We had hypothesized that transient coyotes, whose home-ranges overlap multiple resident packs' territories, might contact a greater variety of individuals and be at greater risk for pathogen exposure. However, it is possible that transients actually make fewer contacts with other coyotes compared to residents, whose frequent interactions among packmates may provide the best opportunity for pathogen transmission. An alternative explanation, at least among adult coyotes ($1.6 yrs), is that the sampled residents tended to be slightly older (10% of transient adult coyotes were old adults [i.e., the other 90% were young adults] compared to the 28% of resident adult coyotes that were old adults), and that perhaps age, which should be positively correlated with exposure risk, was a confounder. From our study alone, it is not clear whether social status among coyotes has a true effect on the pathogen-exposure risk as hypothesized for other social-mammal systems [45, 46] .",

Canine herpesvirus is primarily spread though direct contact, so wolves' higher seroprevalence may be attributed to higher contact rates or a greater variety of contacts compared to coyotes or foxes. Similarly, relatively high intra-pack contact rates may help explain the trend towards a slightly higher risk of pathogen exposure among resident coyotes compared to their transient counterparts. Furthermore, increasing risk of exposure with age, as observed among wolves and coyotes, is common for enzootic diseases.",

This last finding was consistent our hypothesis that high wolf densities on the NR may result in higher inter-pack contact rates and thus higher levels of pathogen exposure compared to the less-dense Interior. Although we do not have Interior density estimates for the other canids, it is quite possible that coyote and fox densities are also higher on the NR than in the Interior, and thus higher canid densities in general may contribute to higher rates of wolf exposure observed on the NR.",

For example, none of the Interior wolf pups handled in 1999 and 2005 had been exposed to CDV in contrast to the high levels of exposure found among the limited samples of Interior adults and NR adults and pups. These inconsistencies may be the result of small samples or differences in case-fatality rates across sampling locations. If all infected pups in the Interior died due to disease, those available for sampling would all be negative. It is also possible that the timing and point of disease introduction into YNP could account for these differences. CDV is generally thought to move quickly through populations as it is highly contagious, infected individuals shed virus for a relatively short time (mean duration of infectiousness = 14 days, maximum 90 days), and the virus rapidly degrades in the environment (within hours at $20uC, and within several weeks at 0-4uC) [15, 16] . Thus, if CDV had entered from the south before pup birth or weaning, it could have swept through the Interior adults, sparing the young Interior pups protected by maternal antibodies but arriving on the NR when pups would be most vulnerable.",

            "text": "The wolf-pup data suggested low rates of seroconversion between the discrete outbreak years of 1999, 2002, and 2005. Once a wild or domestic canid is infected with CDV, the animal either recovers rapidly (mean time from infection to recovery [including latency and infectiousness] = 21 days, maximum 120 days) with life-long immunity or dies [15, 16] . Thus, CDV requires a large population of susceptibles to persist, a population likely larger than YNP's canid community [69] . The low seroconversion between epizootics, if representative of true positives, suggests reexposure from some wild or domestic host outside YNP or mistaken assumptions about the disease. For example, although no evidence exists for carrier states, loss of immunity, or imperfect protection against novel strains of CDV among canids, loss of CDV immunity has been documented in raccoons (Procyon lotor) [70] . If any of these factors pertained to canids, that could help explain the apparent persistence of CDV in YNP. Perhaps more likely, as there are multiple competent hosts for CDV within the GYE (e.g. short and long-tailed weasels, American martens, striped skunks, and raccoons), multi-host transmission might allow localized CDV persistence within the GYE.",

Although $8 young wolfpup carcasses were located in 2005, all were too degraded for CDV isolation. We found several pup mandibles (n = 4) and handled two live pups during the winter of 2005-2006 displaying the distinctive tooth-enamel hypoplasia diagnostic of CDV [12, 71, 72] . Furthermore, several coyote dens appeared to experience high pup loss in 2005, with pups displaying neurologic symptoms consistent with late-stage CDV infection (E. Almberg, personal observation) [16] . More recent data suggests that CDV swept through the park again in 2008, and in addition to observing the same patterns of high CDV seroprevalence and very low wolfpup survival, we recovered CDV ribonucleic acid via PCR from 3 dead wolves, all of which had been born after 2005 and thus presumably had no acquired immunity against CDV (Almberg, unpublished data). Despite the negative correlation between CDV exposure and pup survival, however, the ultimate causes of death could have been due to synergistic effects of CDV and another pathogen (e.g. CPV, CAV-1, canine coronavirus, or protozoan or helminth infections), such as with CDV and Babesia in Serengeti's lions [73] . Population impacts of pup mortality were short term, for the wolf population rebounded in both years following the 1999 and 2005 lows [27] .",

Aside from the hypothesis that the timing of CDV introduction into the Interior either happened to be too early (e.g. 1999 and 2005) or too late (e.g. in 2002) to cause significant pup mortality, other plausible explana-tions for this lack of relationship include 1) that there was no CDV outbreak in 2002, and thus insufficient variation in exposure to detect a relationship with survival, and 2) that we failed to detect pup mortality due to bias in our sampling methods. The Interior packs' dens were remote and only visible from the airplane, and thus, on average, we made our first pup observations and obtained our first high counts of pups over a month later than those made on the NR (First pup observations, NR: m date = 5/24, sd = 21 days, Interior: m date = 6/26, sd = 27 days; First high pup count, NR: m date = 6/19, sd = 34 days, Interior: m date = 7/22, sd = 37 days). Because much microparasite-induced (e.g., viruses and bacteria) pup mortality takes place following weaning (i.e., at 10-12 weeks of age) in late June through early July, it is quite possible that we failed to detect most Interior pup mortality, yielding artificially high survival estimates.",

Also, cougars in YNP appeared to experience isolated outbreaks of CDV in 1991 and 1999 [74] , lending support to the pattern of discrete, multi-host, CDV epizootics. Our own extremely limited fox data at least did not contradict the pattern of discrete CDV outbreaks; the single positive animal sampled in 1996 was $5 years old and thus could have been exposed as a kit during the 1989/90 outbreak, and the only other two positive animals were sampled in 2005. Furthermore, mustelids are highly susceptible to CDV, and the badger population on the NR appeared to have crashed in 2005 (E. Almberg, personal observation). However, there are no data on CDV exposure or survival patterns among mustelids in YNP.",

Although N. caninum is unlikely to impact canid health, wolf exposure indicates a sylvatic cycle in the park, which may or may not be related to the parasite's dynamics among regional livestock. Canine distemper appears to cycle through YNP's carnivores in periodic epizootics, and may have contributed to low wolf-pup survival in 1999 and 2005 on the NR. Although CDV does not appear to jeopardize the long-term population survival of YNP wolves, it can cause short-term population decreases. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected would be useful for regional managers working on canids in the Northern Rocky Mountains.
