Recently, the outbreak of the epidemic disease has been a serious problem in swine industry. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid, sensitive, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in less equipped laboratories. Results: The optimal reaction condition of the current real-time RT-LAMP for PEDV was 62\u00b0C for 45 min. It was capable of detecting PEDV from clinical samples and differentiating PEDV from several related porcine viruses, while it did not require additional expensive equipment. The minimum detection limit of the real-time RT-LAMP assay was 0.07PFU per reaction for PEDV RNA, making this assay approximately 100-fold more sensitive than that of one-step RT-PCR. By screening a panel of clinical specimens, the results showed that this method presented a similar sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR and was somewhat sensitive than one-step RT-PCR in detection of clinical samples.",

So far, PEDV has been observed on most swine breeding farms in most provinces since late 2010 in China [5] .The economic losses caused by PEDV infection have been continuous and serious in China [6] . Recently, PEDV has suddenly emerged in the United States and rapidly spread across the country, resulting in high mortality in infected newborn piglets, which have posed serious economic losses to the swine industry in the USA [7, 8] . Rapid diagnosis and timely monitoring of potential PED outbreaks are among the first important steps in the prevention and control of PED. Currently, several conventional methods are available for the detection of PEDV, including virus isolation, fluorescence assay, immune electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and molecular biological characterization [9] . However, the isolation and identification of viruses require extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks; so this method does not meet the time requirements needed for the prevention of epidemics. Therefore, these rapid, sensitive and specific molecular biological techniques, including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, have played important roles in the rapid detection of PEDV [10] . Nevertheless, all of these techniques require sophisticated instrumentation (such as PCR machines and quantitative fluorescence PCR machines), limiting the effectiveness of these procedures in smaller, under-equipped laboratories.",

This method only requires a water bath or heating block to amplify large amounts of nucleic acids in 30~60 minutes without additional expensive equipments [12] . In addition, there is no need to use nucleic acid electrophoresis to assess the result, for the reason that the result can be easily observed in the presence of a fluorescent dye [13] . These characteristics make the LAMP method a simple, fast, effective and practical DNA amplification method, which has been successfully implemented for the detection of avian influenza A viruses [14] , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [15] , foot-and mouth disease virus [16] and PEDV [17] . The PEDV M protein, the most abundant envelope component, is a triple-spanning membrane glycoprotein with a short amino-terminal domain outside of the virus and a long carboxy-terminal domain inside [18] . The M protein plays an important role in the virus-assembly process, and induces antibodies that neutralize the virus in the presence of its complement [19] . In this study, five primer sets were designed based on the conserved regions of the M gene, and a real-time RT-LAMP method was developed for the detection of PEDV.",

The reaction conditions of the the real-time RT-LAMP were optimized by selecting primers sets and performing the test at different temperatures. Subsequently, its sensitivity was compared with that of one-step RT-PCR. The real-time RT-LAMP assay was able to detect PEDV with a detection limit of 10 \u22121 TCID 50 /mL, which equals to a virus titer of 0.07 PFU (Fig. 3a) . The 10 4.0 TCID 50 /mL PEDV had an RNA viral load of 10 6.846 (7.02 \u00d7 10 6 ) copies. The results showed that the specificity of real-time RT-LAMP for PEDV was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than that of onestep RT-PCR. Moreover, the sensitivity between realtime RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR was compared using the same PEDV RNA template. The real-time RT-LAMP had a similar sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR. Four clinical samples were determined to be PEDV negative by one-step RT-PCR, but the real-time RT-LAMP was able to detect them as PEDV positive. The results further suggested that the real-time RT-LAMP assay was slightly more sensitive than one-step RT-PCR for the detection of the PEDV M gene. The developed PEDV M gene real-time RT-LAMP method has a higher sensitivity (10 \u22121 TCID 50 /mL) than the RT-LAMP method developed for N gene with detection limit 10 0.75 TCID50/ ml, which was determined to be more sensitive than gelbased RT-PCR and ELISA in previous study [17] .",

A set of primers included two outer primers (forward primer M-F3 and reverse primer M-B3), two inner primers (forward inner primer M-FIP and reverse inner primer M-BIP). For comparative purposes, conventional RT-PCR methods based on N and M genes were both constructed. The developed PEDV N gene conventional RT-PCR method sensitivity was higher, in comoparison to the conventional RT-PCR developed for M gene. Therefore, the pair of primers based on N gene (JQ743655, named P1 and P2) designed to amplify a 428-bp fragment was utilized in further study. The primers and probes used for real-time RT-PCR targeting N gene were listed in Table 2 [25] .
