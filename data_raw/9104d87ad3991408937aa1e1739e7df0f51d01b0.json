Here we report the three-dimensional structure and architecture of Ebola virus and establish that multiple copies of the RNA genome can be packaged to produce polyploid virus particles, through an extreme degree of length polymorphism. We show that the helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid containing RNA and nucleoprotein is stabilized by an outer layer of VP24-VP35 bridges. Elucidation of the structure of the membrane-associated glycoprotein in its native state indicates that the putative receptor-binding site is occluded within the molecule, while a major neutralizing epitope is exposed on its surface proximal to the viral envelope. The matrix protein VP40 forms a regular lattice within the envelope, although its contacts with the nucleocapsid are irregular.",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved as genome packaging machines to efficiently transfer nucleic acids between susceptible host cells, ensuring replication. The majority of viruses have hollow, quasispherical shells rather than tubular structures, perhaps because this gives the most efficient packaging of nucleic acid with a fixed copy number of coat protein subunits. In non-enveloped viruses, the volume enclosed by the (usually) icosahedral structure is a constraint on the size of the genome, giving a limited capacity to encode capsid proteins, and usually restricts the genome copy number, or ploidy of the virion, to one [1] . Most membraneenveloped viruses are also quasi-spherical, but their symmetry is frequently less well-ordered, which is usually described as pleomorphic. This feature allows some flexibility in volume, which could accommodate variation in the size of the genome or its copy number. Nevertheless, most viruses, irrespective of their architecture, appear to have evolved to encapsidate only a single copy of their genome within the protein or protein/lipid shell, or a dimeric copy in retroviruses. Notable exceptions are the Paramyxoviridae and the Birnaviridae where particles may contain up to four copies of the RNA genomes [2, 3] . Although some strains of influenza can produce elongated virions, there is a mechanism that selectively encapsidates only one set of genome segments in each virion [4] .",

The 18.9 kb single-stranded negative-sense non-segmented RNA genome of Ebola virus (EBOV) codes for at least eight proteins. The ribonucleoprotein complex is composed of the nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase protein (L), VP24, VP30, and VP35. The trimeric transmembrane glycoprotein (GP) forms surface spikes on the virion envelope and also has a soluble form, while the matrix protein, VP40, is associated with the inner surface. [5, [7] [8] [9] . The GP spike, a class I fusion protein, mediates cellular attachment and entry and is extensively glycosylated, especially in the glycan-rich mucin-like domain [10] [11] [12] [13] . Three proteins, VP24, VP35 and NP are essential for nucleocapsid formation [14] . Although some of the major protein interactions that occur during EBOV morphogenesis have been characterised [14, 15] , the three-dimensional (3D) structure and molecular arrangements have not been previously determined. Structural details are essential to understand how protection of the genome, cell binding, entry, and immune evasion are achieved in a filamentous animal virus, and to determine how this unique morphology plays a role in pathogenesis.",

Previous investigations of filovirus structures within embedded, sectioned and metal-stained cells by electron tomography revealed few details of the high resolution oligomeric structure [16, 17] . It has been demonstrated that aldehyde-fixation alone, and subsequent cryo-electron microscopic imaging in the frozen-hydrated state preserves structures, at least up to 12 angstroms resolution [18] , and in some cases, fixation improves the resolution achievable [19] . In addition, it has also been shown that high-resolution X-ray structures can also be obtained in the presence of aldehyde fixatives [20] . Therefore, we analyzed purified and isolated EBOV and Ebola virus-like structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). In the current study, the Zaire strain of EBOV was purified and inactivated by paraformaldehyde fixation: excess fixative was then removed by dialysis to reduce beam damage for imaging in the frozen-hydrated state. The flashfreezing at liquid ethane temperatures used in cryo-electron microscopy preserves the structural and molecular detail, avoiding artifacts associated with conventional EM methods, such as dehydration and/or sectioning or staining, that usually prevent detailed structural analysis. Digital image processing reveals the 3D organization of EBOV, including the structural arrangement of component molecules at resolutions of 14-19 \u00c5 .",

The nucleocapsid, as observed within intact viral particles, has a uniform helical structure (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4) and is enveloped by a membrane coated by an external layer of GP spikes. From the same image data set, we combined extracted volumes from tomograms with 2-D single particle processing to determine the structure of the GP spikes ( Figure 5 ) to a resolution of 14 \u00c5 as measured by the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) 0.5 criterion. Virions are rarely straight. Variation in the overall length of virions is non-random, and they fit into ordered size classes ( Figure 1 ). Analysis of 2090 distinct intact virions with a nucleocapsid from cryo-electron micrographs shows that the most common class length (53%) of virus particles is 982679 nm ( Figure 1A , Table S1 ). The other size classes are multiples of this length. Enveloped filovirus particles have several Empty and linked EBOV structures were excluded from the histogram data.

These empty nucleocapsids are also visible in previously published thinsection micrographs of human EBOV infected pathology specimens, e.g. [23] , and are thus probably not an artifact of cell culture. It is also unlikely that the polyploidy we have observed in EBOV is a peculiarity of the particular viral isolate or of the Vero cell line that we used for this investigation. Previous studies using negative stain EM have shown that both Marburg virus and several different EBOV species can produce filamentous virions up to 14 mm long when grown in several different cell lines [21, 22] . Blood specimens from Guinea-pigs and monkeys that were inoculated with primary isolates of the Marburg agent, when centrifuged and observed by negative stain, also showed filamentous virions of variable length, with the average reported as about 1 mm in length but with a smaller proportion being over 2 mm in length [24] . In addition, viral filaments of lengths from 1.4 to 1.6 mm long, and occasionally as long as 2.6 mm, can also be seen in published ultrathin sections of EBOV infected human and monkey tissues [23, 25] . Thin-section EM always underestimates the lengths of virions, since filament profiles are frequently truncated by the section plane: in addition, tissue shrinkage of 10 to 20% during dehydration and resin embedding is common. Thus, it is probable that polyploid EBOV with multiple nucleocapsids are also produced in naturally infected humans and animals, though it is not possible to make a direct comparison with cell cultured virus: it would be very difficult to obtain large enough quantities of concentrated virus from animals to carry out detailed cryo-TEM analysis and measurements.",

            "text": "The Ebola nucleocapsid structure was solved to 19 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.5 criteria) using linear regions of 34,605 images (taken at 3-4 mm defocus, Figure 2 ). Since virus particles were not straight enough for conventional helical image processing, a combination of tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, single particle averaging, and the iterative helical real-space construction method were used [26, 27] . The EBOV nucleocapsid is a right-handed doublelayered helix with an outer diameter of 41 nm and a hollow inner channel 16 nm in diameter as determined by image analysis and tomography (Figures 2, 3 , 4, S2, S4, movie S1). The pitch is 6.96 nm, with 10.81 repeats per helical turn ( Figure 2 ). The inner nucleocapsid, composed of large subunits, is linked by vertical and horizontal contacts between the large subunits ( Figure 2E ,F). The horizontal contacts occur between the large subunits at a diameter of 22.3 nm. The vertical contacts linking the coils have a higher density than the horizontal ones, so we interpret the horizontal contacts as involving viral RNA (white arrow, Figures 2E, 4E ; movie S1) and the vertical contacts as protein-protein interactions (yellow arrow, Figure 2E ). The NP subunits are also linked by an outer horizontal layer at a diameter of 37 nm. This layer consists of a ring of bridges between adjacent large subunits ( Figure 2 ). The bridges joining the NP subunits are composed of two lobes, one of which of which is slightly bigger than the other. Previous studies that produced recombinant nucleocapsid-like structures showed that expressed VP24 and VP35 both independently associate with NP, but that all three proteins together are necessary to produce ,50 nm diameter helical nucleocapsid-like structures. When VP35, VP30, VP24, and NP were transfected together, approximately 50 nm diameter helical nucleocapsid-like structure was also generated, whereas NP alone generated helical NP-RNA complexes ,20-25 nm in diameter, which were nuclease sensitive [14, 28, 29] . Taken together these results suggest that VP24 and VP35 are the structural components of the bridge located on the periphery of the nucleocapsid ( Figure 2G ). It is not possible to accurately delineate VP24 and VP35 within the bridge at this resolution, however the density of the bridge is consistent with a predicted total mass of 60 kD, thus each bridge is composed of one molecule of VP24 and one molecule of VP35. It is likely that the larger lobe is VP35 and that VP24 therefore resides within the smaller lobe ( Figure 2F ). Thus, each bridge is composed of a VP24-VP35 heterodimer that holds adjacent NP molecules together horizontally. This structure explains how VP24 and VP35 are able to independently interact with NP, and why all three are required for the formation of a double-layered nucleocapsid. In addition, it implies that VP24 and VP35 can interact with each other as well as each interacting with a different site on the NP molecule in order to make an oligomeric structure.",

This indicates that VP30 does not increase the diameter of the nucleocapsid. We propose that VP30 lies in the interior of the nucleocapsid and is not part of the bridge on the periphery of the nucleocapsid. This localization is consistent with previous work showing that VP30 is a component of the nucleocapsid, and associates with NP, but is non-essential for nucleocapsid formation [14, 30, 31] . Our model, in which the inner layer at 22.3 nm diameter is RNA-NP, and the outer bridge centered at 37 nm is composed of VP24-VP35 heterodimers, with VP30 bound to NP, is thus consistent with these previous observations [14, 28, 29] , and suggests that the outer VP24-VP35 heterodimer bridge functions in the stabilization and/or protection of the nucleocapsid.",

            "text": "We have modeled the arrangement of the RNA within the EBOV nucleocapsid (Table S2 ). Since no atomic resolution data on the ribonucleoprotein structure of filoviruses have yet been reported, the ribonucleoprotein ring-structures of other members of the mononegovirales are useful for comparison. Although the mass of the nucleoproteins, and the number of nucleotides per subunit differs amongst these virus families, a model of the 18.9 kb EBOV genome with the RNA following a circular fixed radius as in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [32] would make a nucleocapsid containing one copy of the EBOV genome about 914 nm long (Table S2 ). This fits closely with the 982 nm length class (53% of the particles observed in this study) containing a single copy of the EBOV genome threaded through the NP at a fixed radius. Allowing 33 nm of space for the membrane envelope to curve around at each end of the virus particle gives an estimated length for a single-genome virus particle of 980 nm, which is very close to that observed (982679 nm). The majority of the virus particles fall into size categories that are a multiple of the putative single genome length (G1), giving size classes of 1.960.15 mm (G2: 18.7% of the particles having 2 genomes); 2.960.2 mm (G3: 12% of particles having 3 genomes) and so on ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) . The length of the longest particle measured was consistent with having 22 genome copies. Our model predicts a nucleotide to NP ratio of 13.0 (Table S2) , which is within the range of 12 to 15 nucleotides per NP molecule as measured by biochemical studies of Marburg virus [33] . In partially full virions, the membrane envelope is constricted at the transition point where the nucleocapsid ends and the empty membrane tube begins (Figures 1, S1C ). Empty virions ( Figure  S1C ) have a similar structure to VP40-GP virus-like particles ( Figure 3A ). Both full and empty virions have a continuous layer of spikes projecting from the surface (Figures S1, S2, S3, movie S2), giving an overall diameter of 120 nm for full particles. The majority of virions are linear (Figures 1, S1A, S5 ), others have a ''comma-shaped'' appearance, with a globular head containing portions of the nucleocapsid that are curled-up or bent at one end ( Figures 1A,B and S1B). It is clear that ''toroidal'' virions previously identified by negative staining [22, 34] are a variation of comma-shaped virions. Internal vesicles of 20-40 nm in size are also sometimes observed at the ends of virions ( Figure S1D ). These vesicles appear to be formed during the process of envelopment of the nucleocapsid, since they were not observed in preparations of VP40 or VP40-GP VLPs. VP40 VLPs had wavy envelopes with an irregular diameter ranging between 48 nm and 142 nm (N = 49) compared to VP40-GP VLPs which were more ordered with a diameter between 50 nm and 91 nm (N = 26), (Figure 3 ). Thus the presence of GP, and certain contacts between the GP and VP40, play a part in stabilizing the tubular membrane envelope structure, and our observed structure agrees with previous reports that GP enhances VP40 VLP budding [35, 36] . The previously reported ''branched'', filamentous forms [34] were rarely observed: these consist of empty tubes (data not shown). It is possible that centrifugal virus purification disrupted most branched structures that were seen previously with negative staining of cell culture supernatant.",

Both the nucleocapsid and the VP40 layers are ordered, however the contacts between them appear to be nonsymmetrical ( Figure 2D ), implying some flexibility in their intermolecular contacts. It has been shown that VP35 interacts with the VP40 and can be packaged into VP40 VLPs [37] . The localization of the VP24-VP35 bridges on the periphery of the nucleocapsid, may allow interactions of one or more of the nucleocapsid proteins with VP40, possibly through projecting low-density protein loops. There is a 6-7 nm gap of low density between the nucleocapsid and the VP40 layer, but tomography also shows discrete areas of connectivity between the nucleocapsid and matrix protein layers, which may be connections between the envelope and the nucleocapsid ( Figure 3I ). These results are substantiated by the analysis of sub-tomograms where helical symmetry is clearly evident but was not imposed (Figures 4, S4) . The use of sub-tomogram analysis improves the resolution of the data by averaging sub-tomograms together which are at different angular orientations. The helical nucleocapsid is clearly identified in the structure, including the gap between the envelope-VP40, and the nucleocapsid-VP40. The right-handed pitch of the helix is clearly discernable (Figure 4E ), as well as the putative location of several VP40 proteins, although the resolution of the tomographic data by itself is slightly lower than with single particle analysis. While showing the overall organization of EBOV, tomography also allows estimation of the stoichiometry of the major structural proteins (Figure 3 , movie S2). Both EBOV and VP40-GP VLPs have an irregular distribution of the GP spikes on the surface (Figures 3, S3) demonstrating the lack of any ordered lattice-like arrangement with the matrix protein VP40. The spikes are clustered, and the average centre-to-centre spacing is 15.2 nm ( Figure S3, and movie S3) . We calculate that a virion of 982 nm in length would have about 1888 copies of the GP spike, and 8391 copies of VP40. The wide spacing of the EBOV GP in the viral envelope allows plenty of space for free access and binding of any neutralizing antibodies directed at both the club-shaped head and stem region without stearic hindrance (Figures 3J, S3) .",

A genome of 18.9 kbp with 13 bases per NP with a single genome copy gives 1454 molecules of NP, VP24, VP30, and VP35 per virion. Previous analyses of Coomassie blue stained gels of purified EBOV predicted 625, 1208, 833, and 2686 protein molecules of NP, VP24, VP30, and VP35, per virion respectively [38] , which is in the same stoichiometric range as predicted by our model for the nucleocapsid, taking into account the variability of individual protein band staining by Coomassie blue, which is affected by factors such as distance of migration [39] , basic amino acid content [40] , and the extent of glycosylation [41] . Since NP is glycosylated, we anticipate underestimation of the NP content of virions [14, 41] .",

A definitive cell surface ligand for the receptor binding domain has not been identified, and a number of different cell surface proteins are able to enhance infection [42, 43] . Cleavage of GP results in two domains: GP1 containing the receptor binding domain and GP2 that contains the fusion and transmembrane domains. The structure of a smaller engineered fragment of GP1-GP2 has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (3CSY pdb [42] ). We determined the structure of the entire EBOV GP trimeric spike at a resolution of 14 \u00c5 (FSC 0.5 criteria), by combining sub-tomograms from the spikes of VP40-GP VLPs (234 images) with EBOV images for the side perspective data (8084 images) using projection matching as previously described [44] ( Figure 5 and movie S4). In our reconstruction, the spike is in situ in the viral membrane, thus the transmembrane region and base of the spike, adjacent to the membrane, are less well defined than the distal region of the spike, due to the smaller differences in contrast between lipid and protein versus water and protein, as well as Fresnel fringes at the edge of the viral membrane. The spike extends 10 nm from the surface of the envelope, with a clubshaped head 6.5 nm in height, and a 3.5 nm long stalk. Docking of the previously determined X-ray structure into our cryo-EM map shows a good fit, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 using the docking and correlation program SITUS [45] . The difference map calculated between our cryo-EM map and the GP1-GP2 structure identified volumes corresponding to the domains deleted to generate the 3CSY GP1-GP2 structure ( Figure 5 ). We show that the mucin-like domains (connected at V310 and E502 -shown in Green in Figure 5 ) completely fill the previously described bowllike chalice which contains the putative receptor binding sites [42] . The proximity of glycosylation sites in the GP1-GP2 structure suggests that the distal density of the spike contains the glycans that were deleted in order to construct the GP1-GP2 structure. In addition, each mucin-like domain has an ''arm-like'' projection, which extends radially at the distal end of the spike, to a maximum diameter of 13 nm. The localization of the mucin-like domain is consistent with previous studies showing that endosomal proteolysis plays a role in enhancing infectivity as well as binding of the Ebola GP to the plasma membrane [46, 47] .",

Inclusion of the KZ52 Fab in the docked structure demonstrates that this neutralizing epitope (from a human survivor) is localized on the side of the stem region of EBOV GP trimer at the base of the clubshaped head, and that the Fab domain lies close to the lipid envelope when bound, and approximately tangential to the viral envelope. The densities putatively corresponding to N278-R299 and A189-Y214 are close to the KZ52 neutralizing site, but do not obstruct antibody binding. The mucin-like domains are out of the way and cannot interfere stearically with KZ52 Fab binding. This is consistent with previous results indicating that KZ52 binding does not require cathepsin cleavage [48] . We have thus delineated the low resolution structure of the glycocalyx or ''glycan cap'' that covers the distal end of the uncleaved EBOV GP spike, which is consistent with a proposed role in immune evasion [42] . Our data will enable docking of future structures to investigate receptor binding, antigenicity, and fusion mechanisms.",

Polyploidy in filoviruses may be more extensive than in any other virus family, with 46% of virions having more than one genome copy, and some having up to 22 copies. Polyploidy has been shown to increase infectivity rates in paramyxovirus and birnavirus [2, 3] . Attempts to investigate infectivity rates of EBOV by centrifugal fractionation of the different sized particles are stymied by the extreme filamentous morphology, as well as that fact that EBOV of different lengths have the same buoyant density (personal observations). A complex double layered helical nucleocapsid appears to be unique to filoviruses. In the case of rhabdoviruses, the bullet-shaped nucleocapsid precludes them from being linked sequentially. Although some influenza strains can produce filamentous virions, this morphology appears to be driven by the matrix protein only [49] . A filamentous morphology may have evolutionary implications by allowing genome length flexibility. It could also enhance the ability for viral dissemination in infected tissues, for example by diapedesis of budding filamentous virions through epithelial layers.",

In this instance the term ''image stack'' refers to all the images collected in a single tomographic tilt. This procedure involves the selection of ten to twenty of the 10 nm gold particles and the subsequent identification and tracking of these particles in all of the images in the image stack. The locations of these particles are then used in conjecture with the tilt angles of each image to globally align all of the images to each other.

This procedure requires an initial 3D helical reference structure which is used for image alignment. In this investigation a linear region of the Ebola virus which was extracted from a tomogram was used to generate this helical reference structure. This initial 3D structure was first pre-treated with a Gaussian mask to select only the nucleocapsid-containing region of the virus tomogram. An auto correlation function was then performed in which the volume was rotated around the helical axis, and translated along the axis of the nucleocapsid. At each rotational and translational position and autocorrelation value was calculated (between the shifted and unshifted volume). The net result of this process was the determination of the helical symmetry present in the tomogram. In order to analyse the data generated by this procedure the Microsoft excel spread sheet program was used. The correlation plots generated by this process solved the handedness, pitch, and number of repeats per turn for the nucleocapsid. These symmetry parameters were then applied to the tomogram to generate the initial 3D model. The IHRSR method was then applied to the 34,605 single particle images of the nucleocapsid as previously described [26, 27] .",

The 3D images and movies presented in this manuscript were generated directly by UCSF Chimera software package. , Region three is shown, with the locations of correlation maxima shown with an X. The angular distance between each maximum was calculated from several plots. A total of 71 measurements gave an average angular distance of 33.6u+/ 28.5u between helical repeats, resulting in 10.7 repeats per turn. Using the 6.96 nm pitch (Fig. S8 ) the step in Z per helical repeat was calculated as 0.65 nm. These helical symmetry values were then imposed on the nucleocapsid tomogram and this structure was used as the initial reference volume for refinement using the iterative helical real space reconstruction method.

The RSV-based model, with a relatively straight/circular pattern of RNA in the helix predicted a nucleocapsid 914.55 nm long, which closely fits the measured length of G1 virions, after allowing ,34 nm space at each end to accommodate the curve of the envelope containing GP spikes and matrix proteins. The RSV-like model gives 13 nucleotides per nucleocapsid protein which is similar to previous biochemical estimates of 12-15 for Marburg virus [33] , suggesting that the RNA in the EBOV nucleocapsid is arranged in a smooth helical pattern at a diameter of ,22 nm.

The viral filaments are not perfectly straight, and are often curved, complicating helical image processing. Glycoprotein spikes (GP), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (NC) are all clearly visible. The black spherical objects (shown by black arrows) are 10 nm colloidal gold particles which are used for automated focusing and tomography alignment. (B) Images of ''comma-shaped'' Ebola virus. Each of the comma-shaped viruses has a single copy of the genome which can be seen running through the center of the virus and curving at one end of the virus to form the globular head. In some of the heads there is a low-density region (LD) devoid of nucleocapsid. In others, the nucleocapsid is sharply bent where it folds back on itself and looks like a check mark (right panel). (C) Ebola virus structures with and without nucleocapsid. Empty tubular filaments (E), and viral filaments containing a nucleocapsid (NC) are shown. Constrictions at the transition points where the nucleocapsid ends and the viral membrane continues as an empty tubular structure are indicated by red arrow heads. The diameters are as follows: nucleocapsid, 41 nm; virus with nucleocapsid, 96-98 nm; empty filaments, 48-52 nm. (D) Ebola virus with interior vesicles. Viral particles containing additional membrane vesicles within the envelope are shown by a green ''V''. Although present in a minority of virus particles, when present they are usually at the ends of the virus with a globular head. The image in the left hand column shows an example where the vesicles are in the middle of the virus. (TIF) Figure S2 Tomographic slices of Ebola virus. Slices in ''Z'' of Ebola virus tomogram reveal the components of the virus and nucleocapsid (A). The insets show 2D averages of the nucleocapsid. The slice through the top of the virus reveals the envelope and glycoprotein spikes. The next slice cuts through the top of the nucleocapsid (NC) revealing the banding pattern which represents VP24-VP35 bridge. The third slice cuts through the middle of the NC. The tube-like component of the NC is primarily composed of NP. The last panel shows the average of 53 slices which make up the volume encompassing the entire NC. The image and the average in the inset contain all structural components of the NC.

At each shift/rotation point the volume was correlated to the initial (un-shifted) volume. The correlation plot is shown as a grey scale image.
