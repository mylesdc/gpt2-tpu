            "text": "In chronic HCV infection, treatment failure and defective host immune response highly demand improved therapy strategies. Vc9Vd2 T-cells may inhibit HCV replication in vitro through IFN-c release after Phosphoantigen (PhAg) stimulation. The aim of our work was to analyze Vc9Vd2 T-cell functionality during chronic HCV infection, studying the role of IFN-a on their function capability. IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T-cells was analyzed in vitro in 24 HCV-infected patients and 35 healthy donors (HD) after PhAg stimulation with or without IFN-a. The effect of in vivo PhAg/IFN-a administration on plasma IFN-c levels was analyzed in M. fascicularis monkeys. A quantitative analysis of IFN-c mRNA level and stability in Vc9Vd2 T-cells was also evaluated. During chronic HCV infection, Vc9Vd2 T-cells showed an effector/activated phenotype and were significantly impaired in IFN-c production. Interestingly, IFN-a was able to improve their IFN-c response to PhAg both in vitro in HD and HCV-infected patients, and in vivo in Macaca fascicularis primates. Finally, IFN-a increased IFN-c-mRNA transcription and stability in PhAg-activated Vc9Vd2 T-cells. Altogether our results show a functional impairment of Vc9Vd2 T-cells during chronic HCV infection that can be partially restored by using IFN-a. A study aimed to evaluate the antiviral impact of PhAg/IFN-a combination may provide new insight in designing possible combined strategies to improve HCV infection treatment outcome.",

Current standard therapy is based on a combination of pegylated (PEG)-IFN-a and ribavirin (RBV) and treatment response may be influenced by several virusrelated factors such as HCV genotype and baseline titer of HCV RNA [2, 3] . A sustained virological response (SVR) occurs in approximately 80% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, and in approximately 45% for genotypes 1 or 4 [4] . New antiviral strategies are currently in development for HCV infection and include drugs targeting key viral enzymes such as NS3-4A and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [5] . Although effective, the use of these new antivirals seems associated to the selection of drug-resistant HCV variants, resulting in viral breakthrough. Thus, a combination between antivirals and standard treatment with IFNa and RBV is therefore necessary [3, 6] .",

As observed in other chronic infection such as HIV [20] , a decrease of peripheral Vc9Vd2 T-cell subset was observed associated to HCV infection [10] . Activated Vc9Vd2 T lymphocytes were found able to inhibit subgenomic HCV replication, and this effect was mediated mainly by IFN-c release [21] . A role of recombinant IFN-c on subgenomic HCV replication was also described [22] . Moreover, several studies showed that the combination of recombinant IFN-c and IFN-a resulted in a strongly enhanced antiviral activity in the HCV replicon model, opening the way to new combined treatment approaches. Thus, IFN-c induced by Vc9Vd2 T-cell stimulation could enhance standard treatment effectiveness.",

Plasma IFN-c levels were analyzed before administration, and after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 hours. As shown in Figure 3B , no IFN-c was found before treatment, and a single injection of PhAg resulted in an increase in plasma IFN-c level, reaching a peak after 4 hours, declining afterwards. Interestingly, the combined injection of IFN-a and PhAg was able to strongly increase IFN-c release (C max PhAg: 1,370 pg/ml vs. C max PhAg/IFN-a: 2,155 pg/ml), showing that PhAg/IFN-a combination is able to boost in vivo IFN-c production. Figure 4B ]. Notably, in HCV-infected patients, IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T-cells after PhAg/IFN-a stimulation did not reach the level found in HD. Nevertheless, the relative impact of IFN-a in improving individual Vc9Vd2 T-cell responsiveness was higher in HCVinfected patients than in HD ( Figure 4C ). Figure 5A ).",

Specifically, antiviral role of activated Vc9Vd2 T-cells, mainly mediated by IFN-c release, has been demonstrated for several viruses such as coronavirus [25] , orthopoxvirus [26] , HIV [27] , and HCV [21] . In our work, a severe functional inability of Vc9Vd2 T-cells to produce IFN-c was shown in HCV patients, independently from viral load and genotype. Other innate immune cells are known to show quantitative and qualitative defects during chronic HCV infection such as DC [28] and NK cells [8] [9] [10] , that could be associated to adaptive immune response dysfunction and/or exhaustion [28] . In this context, a complex network of different signals can act to induce immune cell exhaustion, such as chronic inflammation, persistent antigen stimulation, and/or direct viral effects [29] . Chronic inflammation and persistent antigen stimulation, as observed during HIV infection, may result in Vc9Vd2 T-cell exhaustion and anergy through activation-induced cell death [30] , or through a decrease in Vc9Vd2 T-cells response by down-modulating CD3-j chain expression [31] . Finally, although controversial [32, 33] , a possible direct HCV-driven inhibition of NK cell function through HCV-E2/CD81 binding has been reported [34] . Interestingly, CD81 expression by cd T-cells was previously reported [35] . A study aimed to define cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in Vc9Vd2 T-cells exhaustion during chronic HCV infection may be useful to evaluate possible strategies to restore their activity.",

            "text": "The main result of our work is the demonstration that Vc9Vd2 T-cell function may be improved by IFN-a both in HD and in HCV-infected patients, resulting in a higher IFN-c production. A first demonstration that type-I IFN may be sensed by Vc9Vd2 Tcells was reported by Kunzmann et al., showing an increase of CD69 after IFN-a treatment [36] . We confirmed this observation (data not shown) and showed the ability of IFN-a to increase Vc9Vd2 T-cell response to PhAgs stimulation in terms of IFN-c production both in HD and in HCV-infected patients. In particular, the significant impairment of Vc9Vd2 T-cells in HCVinfected patients did not allow to obtain their complete restoration by IFN-a. Nevertheless, individual relative impact of PhAg/IFN-a co-stimulation was found much higher in HCV patients, due to the very low level of responsiveness to PhAgs. Thus, the possibility to restore IFN-c production in vivo by combining standard IFN-a treatment and PhAg stimulation may have a positive impact on HCV inhibition. Indeed several reports show that IFN-a and IFNc may synergistically inhibit HCV replication in vitro [22, 37, 38] and this effect is also reported for other viruses [39] . Nevertheless, a study aimed to evaluate the antiviral impact of PhAg/IFN-a combination is ongoing and may validate new combined treatment strategies. Interestingly, PhAg-activated Vc9Vd2 Tcells are able not only to produce IFN-c but also to deploy many different response pathways, such as DC activation [17] , and neutrophils recruitment/activation [18] , thus improving the overall protective immune response capability. Noteworthy, IFNa effect on PhAg/response was found also in vivo in pre-clinical trials on non-human primates, inducing an increase in IFN-c amount in animals sera. A time-course study of in vivo IFN-a treatment on Vc9Vd2 T-cell responsiveness to PhAg in HCVinfected patients is currently in progress.",

In this context Vc9Vd2 T-cells may represent a good target of immunomodulating strategies for their ability to be easily activated in vivo by PhAgs [12, [43] [44] [45] without HLA restriction [46] and to orchestrate a complex network of antiviral and immunomodulating activities [17] [18] [19] . We show here for the first time that IFN-a, currently used in standard therapy, is able to improve Vc9Vd2 T-cell responsiveness in HCV patients. This, and the finding that IFN-c can act synergistically with IFN-a to inhibit HCV replication [22, 37, 38] , strengthen the rational for testing combined standard antiviral and immunostimulating therapeutical strategies. To this aim, future in vivo studies on HCV-infected non-human primates aimed to define the antiviral capability of the combined treatment are necessary both to assess safety and antiviral effectiveness of this combined approach, and to disclose the cellular/molecular mechanisms involved.",
