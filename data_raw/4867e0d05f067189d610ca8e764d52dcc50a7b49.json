            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of acute pediatric lower respiratory tract infections worldwide, with no available vaccine or effective antiviral drug. To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na + ,K + -ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we identified ATP1A1 as a host protein essential for macropinocytic entry of RSV into respiratory epithelial cells, and identified PST2238 as a potential anti-RSV drug.

            "text": "RSV continues to be the most important viral cause of severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children, and also has a substantial impact in the elderly. It is estimated to claim the lives of~118,000 children under five years of age annually. No vaccine or antiviral drug suitable for general use is available. The involvement of host factors in RSV infection and replication is not well understood, but this knowledge might lead to intervention strategies to prevent infection. Using a genome-wide siRNA screen to knock down the expression of over 20,000 individual cellular genes, we identified ATP1A1, the major subunit of the Na + ,K + -ATPase, as an important host protein for RSV entry. We showed that ATP1A1 activation by RSV resulted in transactivation of EGFR by Src-kinase activity, resulting in the uptake of RSV particles into the host cell through macropinocytosis. We also showed that the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the synthetic digitoxigenin derivative PST2238, which bind specifically to the extracellular domain of ATP1A1, significantly reduced RSV entry. Taken together, we describe a novel ATP1A1-enabled mechanism used by RSV to enter the host cell, and describe candidate antiviral drugs that block this entry.

RSV [14], but how this occurs was unknown. It remained unknown if EGFR alone is sufficient or requires other factors to initiate signaling, or if EGFR and its associated signaling are somehow physically linked with caveolae. While RSV entry generally has been thought to involve fusion between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane, new evidence suggested either of two additional, different uptake pathways, namely EGFR-triggered macropinocytosis [14] and clathrin-mediated endocytosis [15]. It is unclear if one or both are involved.",

            "text": "We describe an in vitro genome-wide siRNA screen that was performed to identify cellular proteins with presumptive roles in RSV infection. One of the proteins identified by this screen was described previously [16] . Another protein that was identified is ATP1A1 (GenBank ID: 476), the \u03b1-subunit of the Na + ,K + -ATPase complex located in the plasma membrane. This complex contains in addition a \u03b2-subunit, and usually also a \u03b3-subunit (also known as the FXYD subunit) [17, 18] . ATP1A1 is the major subunit and contains ten transmembrane helices that embed the protein complex in the plasma membrane and form the ion channel. The \u03b2 and FXYD subunits are important for the ion transport properties of the Na + ,K + -ATPase and also stabilize the complex [19] . Humans express three additional \u03b1-isoforms beside ATP1A1 (ATP1A2, ATP1A3, and ATP1A4). The expression profile of the four isoforms is cell typedependent, with ATP1A1 being expressed ubiquitously and being the predominant isoform in A549 cells [20] (minor amounts of ATP1A3 have been found in A549 cells, but are 50-fold reduced compared to ATP1A1 [20]). In the ciliated epithelial cells lining the nasopharynx and the bronchi of both mice and humans, Na + ,K + -ATPase bearing ATP1A1 is present in greater abundance on the basolateral surfaces and in lower abundance on the apical surface; it also is readily detected in human alveolar cells including on the luminal surface [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "Na + ,K + -ATPase plays a major role in ion transport, maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance. In addition, a subpopulation of Na + ,K + -ATPase that is localized in caveolae [24, 25] uniquely can engage in signal transduction, via the ATP1A1 subunit [17, [26] [27] [28] . Na + ,K + -ATPase, bearing the ATP1A1 subunit, has been well-characterized as the sole receptor for cardiotonic steroids (CTS) such as ouabain, which are its sole known agonists initiating signaling. Ouabain has been reported in humans as an endogenous hormone-like agent that contributes to the regulation of blood pressure, among other things, via ATP1A1 signaling [29] . ATP1A1 does not possess a known cytoplasmic signaling domain, but it interacts through its cytoplasmic tail with the cellular kinase c-Src [30] . ATP1A1 initiates signaling by conferring a conformational change to c-Src that exposes its kinase domain, leading to activation through autophosphorylation of c-Src at tyrosine 418 [30]. This can trigger several different signaling pathways, which can lead to the induction of endocytosis by more than one mechanism. For example, activated c-Src can mediate phosphorylation and activation of EGFR in an EGFindependent manner [31, 32] , which can induce macropinocytosis [31] , similar to the wellcharacterized EGF-induced macropinocytosis [33, 34] . Activated c-Src also can trigger signaling through the PI3K pathway to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis [17, 26] . Incidentally, this results in removal of Na + ,K + -ATPase from the plasma membrane for degradation in the lysosome [35, 36] , resulting in decreased ion channel activity and increased blood pressure. This can be reversed by a synthetic digitoxigenin derivative called PST2238 (or rostafuroxin), which competitively inhibits ouabain binding and signaling [37] and is being evaluated as a therapeutic to lower this kind of hypertension [38] .",

For instance, it was shown that RSV utilizes lipid rafts in cholesterol-rich microdomains on the cell surface known as caveolae as a docking platform for entry [9] . Cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) appear to be important in RSV attachment to immortalized cell lines [10] , but GAGs do not appear to be present on the apical surfaces of primary epithelial cells and so may not play an important role in vivo. The G protein contains a CX3C motif reported to mediate cell attachment by binding to the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 [11, 12] . Nucleolin also has been reported as a cellular receptor for RSV that is bound by the F protein [13] . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has been postulated to play a role in triggering macropinocytic uptake of signaling occur in the caveolae and can be inhibited by cholesterol depletion. The cardiotonic steroid ouabain or the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 inhibit RSV-triggered ATP1A1 activation, prevent RSV entry, and thus could serve as a target for antiviral drug development.",

With time, the ATP1A1 clusters became more prominent and numerous, as shown for 30 min and 5 h p.i. (Fig 3A, third and fourth panel) . All shown timepoints are very early in the RSV replication cycle. Some ATP1A1 clusters, but not all, partially co-localized with RSV F protein ( Fig 3A, indicated by arrows) . The localization of clustered ATP1A1 in close proximity to RSV F became more noticeable at later time points such as 5 h p.i. (Fig 3A, bottom panel) . Localization of ATP1A1 clusters close to RSV N protein also could be observed (Fig 4 and S2  Fig) : co-localization with both F and N suggested that the RSV-specific staining most likely reflects enveloped virions (which had not yet fused). Similar clustering of ATP1A1 and RSV N protein also was observed for UV-inactivated RSV (S2 Fig), indicating that the staining largely involved pre-formed proteins from the incoming virus, and that clustering does not require transcription of the complete viral genome, viral RNA replication, or virus replication.",

The RSV dSH virus induced clustering that was very similar to that with wt RSV, indicating that deletion of the SH protein seemed to have no effect on ATP1A1 clustering. On the other hand, the dSH/dG virus did not induce any ATP1A1 clustering, and the viral particles, stained for RSV N in red, were reduced in amount and were much more dispersed as compared to wt RSV and the dSH virus.

The only known agonists for ATP1A1 signaling are CTS such as ouabain, which activate non-receptor tyrosine kinase Srcmediated signaling pathways [29] .

In mock-treated cells, ATP1A1 and EGFR had homogeneous membrane distributions ( Fig 5A, left column) .

EGFR (red) was detected by an anti-EGFR rat MAb (ab231) and an AF647-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar 10 \u03bcm. compounds present throughout. RSV infection was evaluated by (i) GFP expression 17 h p.i. (Fig 5B) , and (ii) the yield of progeny RSV harvested 24 h p.i., quantified by plaque assay on Vero cells (Fig 5C) . Both methods correlated well, and demonstrated a reduction in RSV replication for both compounds that was greater than that achieved with the ATP1A1-specific siR-NAs (Fig 2) . Ouabain had the strongest effect: it reduced viral GFP expression by 96% and virus yield by almost 3.0 log 10 compared to infected cells that did not receive the drug, and the corresponding reductions observed with PST2238 were 89% (GFP reduction) and 2.0 log 10 (reduction in viral yield).",

A549 cells were pre-treated with these inhibitors separately or together for 5 h, using concentrations that preliminary studies showed were non-cytotoxic (S4 Fig) , followed by infection with RSV-GFP (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) in the continued presence of inhibitors.

Each Src-inhibitor showed a modest but significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in GFP intensity of 23% (SrcI-I) and 33% (PP2) relative to mock-treated infected cells. When added together, the inhibitory effect increased to 45% reduction compared to mocktreated infected cells. The RSV titer (PFU) for the combined Src-inhibitor treatment showed a 2-fold, significant (two-tailed, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0014) reduction compared to mocktreated infected cells.

The phosphorylation of Tyr845 in RSV-infected cells was similar to Neg. siRNA1. While it was slightly reduced for Neg. siRNA2, the difference was not significant (p = 0.3651) compared to Neg. siRNA1.

For ouabain-and PST2238-treated cells, the level of pTyr845 was reduced to 27% and 26%, respectively, compared to mock-treated RSV-infected cells; the reduction was similar to that observed for ATP1A1 knockdown. To confirm a lack of a direct inhibitory effect of Ouabain or PST2238 on EGFR, A549 cells were pre-treated with PST2238 or Ouabain and stimulated with EGF for 45 min. The EGF-induced phosphorylation of pTyr845 indeed was not affected by the compounds as compared to mocktreated cells (Fig 8D) . The Src-kinase inhibitors (SrcI-I+PP2) reduced phosphorylation at Tyr845 to 12% compared to mock-treated infected cells ( Fig 8C) . Thus, phosphorylation at EGFR Tyr845 could be reduced either by decreasing ATP1A1 expression or by ATP1A1-or Src-specific inhibitors. This suggested that EGFR pTyr845 is ATP1A1-dependent and that Srckinase serves as a signaling effector to transactivate EGFR by Tyr845 phosphorylation.",

Macropinocytosis is a nonspecific, fluidic uptake at the cell surface that initiates through actin rearrangement and membrane ruffling that give rise to large vesicles called macropinosomes. Limited prior evidence suggested macropinocytosis as a route of RSV uptake [14, 16] . In the present study, A549 cells were infected with wt RSV (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) in the presence of dextran (10,000 MW) conjugated to fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor [AF] 568) as a fluidic uptake marker. At different time points p.i., cells were washed and fixed, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and the uptake of dextran was analyzed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Cells that had been mock-infected were found to contain dextran-positive vesicles that were small, round, and homogeneous in size with an average volume of~0.5 \u03bcm 3 (Fig 9A, top panel) , reflecting the basal level of dextran uptake. This phenotype changed dramatically by 5 h after infection with wt RSV (Fig 9A,  bottom panel) . The dextran-positive vesicles were much bigger (average volume of~5.7 \u03bcm 3 ) and irregular in shape, as is typical of macropinosomes. The induction of large dextran-positive vesicles also was visible at earlier time points and could be detected as early as 30 min p.i. and became more prominent at 1 h p.i. (S7 Fig) . This showed that RSV infection induces macropinocytosis.",

As previously noted, 5 h p.i. is very early in RSV infection, and the N protein that is detected would be mainly from the input virus particles, as was shown earlier with UV-inactivated virus. Clusters of ATP1A1 were observed co-localized with RSV N protein in the dextran-positive macropinosomes (Fig 9B, indicated by arrows), indicating that RSV was indeed taken up by macropinocytosis. Co-staining for RSV F and N was also performed and showed that both proteins were co-localized in the dextran-positive macropinosomes (Fig 9C) . The presence of RSV F suggests that the RSV detected in the macropinosomes was enveloped, indicating that fusion and release of RSV induces and is taken up by ATP1A1-dependent macropinocytosis, which can be blocked by ouabain or PST2238. Macropinocytosis was assayed by monitoring the uptake of dextran (10,000 MW) conjugated to AF568 (dextran-AF568). All incubations with dextran-AF568 were preceded by serum-starvation for 16 h. (A) RSV induces macropinocytosis. A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with wt RSV (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) in medium containing dextran-AF568 (cyan). At 5 h p. i., cells were fixed with 4% PFA and nuclei counterstained with DAPI (blue), and imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 40x Objective NA 1.3 and 2.0x zoom.

Next, these cells were infected with RSV (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) in the presence of dextran-AF568, followed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Multiple random Z-stack images were acquired by confocal microscopy, and dextran-positive vesicles were analyzed by Imaris imaging software to determine the total fluorescence intensity per vesicle. Vesicles smaller than 1.0 \u03bcm 3 were excluded to omit the basal level of dextran uptake and to focus on the large vesicles that are typical for macropinosomes. The total intensity of dextran vesicles larger than 1.0 \u03bcm 3 was determined per field, normalized to the number of nuclei and expressed relative to Neg. siRNA1-transfected cells (Fig 9D) . This showed that dextran uptake was increased 4-fold in RSV-infected as compared to uninfected-cells, which had both been transfected with Neg. siRNA1 (Fig 9D) , confirming the visual observation of increased dextran-AF568 uptake (Fig 9A) . On the other hand, knockdown of ATP1A1 caused a significant (p = 0.0003) reduction of 33% compared to Neg. siRNA1 (Fig 9D) . Ouabain and PST2238 caused an even-greater reduction in RSV-induced macropinosomes, to less than 50% compared to mock-treated, RSV-infected cells (Fig 9E) . Since RSV G was suggested to be important for triggering ATP1A1 activation, based on the loss of clustering observed with the dSH/ dG mutant as described previously in Fig 4, we also quantified macropinosomes in cells infected with wt RSV or the dSH/dG RSV mutant. This showed that macropinosome formation indeed was significantly (p = 0.0039) reduced for the dSH/dG virus as compared to wt RSV (Fig 9F) , consistent with a role for the G protein in activating the pathway leading to macropinosome formation.",

The structural integrity of caveolae depends on the presence of cholesterol, and cholesterol-depletion disrupts caveolae from the plasma membrane [39, 40] . We therefore evaluated the impact of depleting cholesterol in A549 cells prior to RSV infection, which was done using methylbeta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and Mevinolin, individually or in combination at non-cytotoxic antibodies. Z-stacks were acquired on Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 63x objective, NA 1.4 and 3.0x zoom. Arrows indicate co-localization of ATP1A1 (green) and RSV N (red) in dextran-AF568-positive (cyan) vesicles. (C) Co-localization of RSV F and RSV N with dextran-AF568 in RSV-infected A549 cells. Cells were infected with RSV in the presence of dextran-AF568, incubated for 5 h, fixed, and permeabilized as described in B. The cells were then subjected to immunostaining: RSV F was detected with AF488-conjugated anti-RSV F MAb #1129 [72] , and RSV N was detected with an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-RSV N MAb (NB100-64752APC, Novus Biologicals, LLC). Image acquisition and analysis were performed as described above for B. Arrows indicate RSV F (green) and RSV N (red) in dextran-AF568-positive (cyan) vesicles. All scale bars are 10 \u03bcm. (D-F) Quantification of dextran-AF568 uptake during RSV infection. (D) A549 cells were transfected with ATP1A1 siRNA2 or Neg. siRNA 1, incubated for 48 h p.t., and inoculated with wt RSV in dextran-AF568-containing medium, or (E) A549 cells were pre-treated with ouabain or PST2238 for 16 h and inoculated with wt RSV in dextran-AF568-containing medium, or (F) A549 cells were infected with wt RSV or rgRSV dSH/dG in dextran-AF568-containing medium. For all treatments (D-F) cells were fixed 5 h p.i., counterstained with DAPI and z-stacks were acquired on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 63x objective NA 1.4, 1.0x zoom. For each treatment, the uptake of dextran-AF568 in vesicles greater than 1.0 \u03bcm 3 was quantified as described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. Mean values are reported relative to RSV-infected cells transfected with Neg. siRNA 1 (D), or mock-treated infected cells (E), or wt RSV-infected cells (F). Error bars indicate the standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. The statistical significance of difference was determined for (D) and (E) by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison post-test and for (F) by a two-tailed unpaired t-test. P-values are shown for each comparison. First, we infected cholesterol-depleted A549 cells with RSV-GFP and found that GFP expression at 17 h p.i. was reduced to approximately 50% with each of the depletions, compared to control infected cells (Fig 10A) . Next, we quantified the level of RSV-induced macropinocytosis in cholesterol-depleted cells by dextran-AF568 uptake into large vesicles. In RSVinfected cells, dextran uptake was reduced by each of the cholesterol-depletion treatments, with the most significant (p < 0.0001) reduction of 59% observed for the combined MBCD-Mevinolin treatment (Fig 10B) . The phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 also was determined in RSV-infected cells pretreated with MBCD + Mevinolin. A modest but significant (two tailed t-test, p = 0.0163) reduction in pTyr845 was observed (Fig 10C) . These results show that cholesterol depletion results in reduced EGFR transactivation, reduced macropinocytosis, and reduced RSV infection, consistent with caveolae as the site of ATP1A1 signaling.",

Following the same protocols as for A549 cells, we found that (i) knockdown of ATP1A1 reduced the expression of RSV-GFP to 29-42% of the negative control (Fig 11B) , similar to what was observed with A549 cells (Fig 2A) .

The apical surface was demarcated by staining for F-actin (cyan) since it is abundant beneath the apical membrane and provides a close estimation of the apical surface location. To visualize ATP1A1 location, three-dimensional sections are shown without ( Fig 12A) and with (Fig 12B) F-actin staining. In mock treated cells, ATP1A1 was predominantly present in the basolateral surfaces of cells with relatively smaller amounts present on the apical surface in a spotted distribution, (Fig 12, left panel) . Upon infection with RSV, ATP1A1 clusters were visible as early as 1 h p.i. (Fig 12A and 12B, middle panel) , which became more noticeable and larger at 5 h p. i. (Fig 12A and 12B right panel) . The apical ATP1A1 seemed to increase in amount over time following infection, suggesting its recruitment to the apical surface. The ATP1A1 clusters were mostly visible in close proximity to RSV F. These observations were similar to those in A549 cells (Fig 3) , confirming that RSV-induced ATP1A1 clustering could be reproducibly demonstrated in two different primary cell systems.",

Inhibition of RSV infection with ouabain was achieved at sub-nanomolar concentrations that initiate ATP1A1 signaling cascades [17, 26] but are not inhibitory for its ATPase and ion channel functions and do not alter the cytosolic Na + and K + levels [41] . While incubation with ouabain depletes Na + ,K + -ATPase over time from the plasma membrane, it is unlikely that this depletion was the sole mechanism for the inhibition of RSV infection, because the antiviral effect of ouabain was evident even when added simultaneously with the virus inoculum. We speculate that the mechanism of inhibition by shorter-term treatment with ouabain involves the indicated siRNAs, assayed by GFP quantification by ELISA reader, as in Fig 2A.

Treatment with PST2238 also reduced the efficiency of RSV infection. PST2238 is a competitive inhibitor of ouabain that shares a common binding site on the extracellular domain of ATP1A1. PST2238 does not induce signaling and indeed blocks ATP1A1 signaling in response to ouabain or RSV. Both of these ATP1A1-binding drugs implicated ATP1A1-and in particular ATP1A1 signaling-as being important for efficient RSV infection.

This clustering was not affected by treatment with PST2238, indicating that clustering does not depend on ATP1A1 signaling. Clustering of ATP1A1 occurred with equal efficiency with UV-inactivated RSV, and thus was independent of transcription of the complete genome, viral RNA replication, and virus replication. This clustering was reminiscent of the behavior of signaling receptors following ligand binding, and suggested there might be a physical interaction between the virions and the cell surface that triggers ATP1A1 clustering. Interaction of this sort could be imagined as part of viral attachment or part of a cellular response to RSV virions. However, we were unable to detect binding between ATP1A1 and any of the RSV surface glycoproteins (G, F or SH) by various co-immunoprecipitation techniques. For example, we investigated possible binding using the human lung epithelial cell line H1299 ATP1A1-YFP (kindly provided by Uri Alon, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel [42, 43] ) that chromosomally expressed ATP1A1 genetically fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tag. These cells were infected with RSV, incubated for 1h and lysed, and co-immunoprecipitation was performed with YFP-specific antibodies followed by Western blotting with antibodies to RSV proteins. However, there was no evidence of pull-down of RSV proteins. We also performed comparable co-precipitation experiments in which, prior to lysis, cells were treated with the permeable, reversible crosslinker dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) [44] . We also incubated RSV virions with ATP1A1 immobilized on beads. However, there was no evidence of binding between ATP1A1 and RSV proteins in these experiments. We also performed a cell-based binding assay [45] , using A549 cells that had been siRNA-transfected to knock down ATP1A1. Specifically, the cells were transfected with ATP1A1 siRNA, incubated for 48 h, detached, and incubated on ice with RSV for 30 min, after which the cells were extensively washed and incubated with a pool of RSV Fspecific monoclonal antibodies to detect possible bound virus. ATP1A1 knockdown did not result in an appreciable reduction in RSV binding, and thus we did not detect any contribution of ATP1A1 to RSV attachment. Treatment of the cells with heparinase I prior to RSV exposure to remove cell surface GAGs, which was done to eliminate GAG-mediated RSV attachment, also did not reveal any contribution of ATP1A1 to RSV attachment. Therefore, there was no evidence of stable binding of any RSV surface protein to ATP1A1.",

Using RSV deletion mutants, we did demonstrate that the RSV G protein is required to trigger ATP1A1 clustering. This implies that an initial virus attachment event involving G is needed to initiate ATP1A1 clustering. That initial attachment event might involve a direct interaction between RSV G and ATP1A1, although there is as yet no evidence of this, as already noted. It perhaps is more likely that RSV attachment is an earlier event involving other cellular structures, and that attachment induces ATP1A1 signaling through some as-yet unknown intermediate step. Clustering of signaling receptors in general can increase ligand binding and signal transduction [46] by reducing the effective dissociation rate through enhancing rebinding within the receptor cluster [47] . Therefore, clustering of ATP1A1 may be beneficial for RSV infection by enhancing the ATP1A1-mediated signaling that is required for viral uptake.",

Previous studies also have suggested a role for macropinocytosis in RSV uptake [14, 16] . Macropinocytosis also can be induced through components of the ATP1A1 signaling pathway. For example, it has been described that phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 by c-Src, in an EGF-independent manner, can lead to the induction of macropinocytosis [31, 32] , Src-kinase activity plays an important role during macropinosome formation and trafficking [48] , and can synergistically enhance macropinocytic induction [49] .",

They are heterogeneous in size and are larger than other endocytic vesicles, with diameters of 0.5-5 \u03bcm. In RSV-infected cells, extensive macropinocytosis began very early in infection. Macropinosome formation under these conditions was confirmed to be dependent upon ATP1A1, and was significantly reduced if ATP1A1 expression was decreased or if the cells were treated with ouabain or PST2238. Depletion of cholesterol resulted in a decrease in the formation of macropinosomes, consistent with the involvement of signaling complexes in the caveolae. In addition, immunostaining revealed the co-localization of ATP1A1, RSV F protein (marker of viral envelope) and RSV N protein (marker of viral nucleocapsid), and dextran in macropinosomes. This supports a model in which RSV virions are taken up by the macropinosome, and membrane fusion and release of the nucleocapsid presumably taking place at a later step after the macropinocytic uptake. Although the data provide evidence on the role of ATP1A1 in macropinocytic uptake, they do not exclude the possibility of clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an additional mode of RSV entry.",

            "text": "It was somewhat surprising that both ouabain and PST2238 inhibited RSV infection in short-term treatments, since they have opposite effects on ATP1A1 signaling, namely that ouabain induces and PST2238 inhibits signaling. The mechanism by which PST2238 inhibits RSV infection seems straight-forward: specifically, blockade of RSV-induced ATP1A1 signaling. The mechanism by which ouabain inhibits RSV infection is less clear, since both ouabain and RSV individually induce ATP1A1 signaling. We hypothesize that, while the signaling cascades induced by ouabain versus RSV employ some of the same signaling intermediates, their outcomes are not exactly the same. Ouabain-induced signaling results in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas RSV-induced signaling results in macropinocytosis. Also, we could readily detect phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 following infection with RSV, but not following treatment with ouabain, suggestive of a quantitative or qualitative difference in EGFR phosphorylation. Thus, while signaling through ATP1A1 by ouabain versus RSV may involve a number of steps in a common signal transduction pathway, we suggest that the ouabain-induced signaling cascade from ATP1A1 not only is different from that of RSV, but also competes with and thereby inhibits ATP1A1 signaling induced by RSV. ATP1A1-mediated signaling cascades have been reported to take place in the cholesterolrich microdomains called caveolae [27, 28] , which are thought to serve as a region to integrate multiple signaling pathways by concentrating signaling proteins and creating temporal and spatial patterns of cell regulation [24] . Many proteins associated with signaling functions are present in the caveolae, including ATP1A1, EGFR and c-Src [17, 50, 51] . It has also been described that cholesterol is needed for the ouabain-induced ATP1A1-Src-EGFR signaling cascade, and that depletion of cholesterol reduced the recruitment of c-Src and therefore reduced ATP1A1 signaling [27] . Interestingly, it has been reported that the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are required as a docking platform for RSV entry [9] . In the present study, depletion of cholesterol with MBCD and Mevinolin indeed reduced the efficiency of RSV infection, consistent with the signaling by ATP1A1, c-Src, and EGFR taking place in caveolae. We speculate that the inhibitory effects of depleting cholesterol could be due to disintegration of the caveolar ATP1A1-Src-EGFR signaling complexes.",

We also used differentiated HAE-ALI cultures to confirm clustering of ATP1A1 on RSV infection, and to evaluate the distribution of ATP1A1 in a polarized epithelial cell. This showed a strong basolateral presence of ATP1A1 and much reduced speckled expression on the apical surface. However, upon RSV infection, ATP1A1 cluster formation was observed on the apical surface, associated with an increase in the apical amount of ATP1A1 that might be due to increased trafficking to the apical surface. This also showed that the small amounts of apical ATP1A1 present in the uninfected cells is likely sufficient for initiating the signaling cascade.",

In the present study, we showed that VSV infection was not inhibited by ATP1A1 knockdown, indicating that the effect is specific to particular viruses and does not involve a general inhibitory cellular effect. Ouabain has been described to have anti-viral properties for several viruses, namely herpes simplex virus [56, 57] , chikungunya virus [58] , human immunodeficiency virus [59] , adenovirus [60] and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [61] , but the mechanism of inhibition was not conclusively identified. It may be that ouabain inhibits these other viruses in the same way that we propose for RSV, namely that it competes with the virus for signaling through ATP1A1. To our knowledge, PST2238 has not previously been investigated for anti-viral activity against any virus, including RSV. We speculate that PST2238 might also inhibit the replication of other viruses that are ouabain-sensitive by directly blocking ATP1A1 signaling. PST2238 is being evaluated as an anti-hypertensive drug in phase II clinical trials for ouabain-and adducin-induced hypertension patients [38] . PST2238 does not have any known adverse effects, does not lower the blood pressure of healthy humans [62] , and therefore might be well-tolerated as an anti-viral drug.",

The proposed direct intercellular spread presumably occurs only between adjoining cells, while ATP1A1 would be important for spread/uptake into non-contiguous cells. Note that most studies have described the direct intercellular transmission using cell lines (reviewed in [63] ).

RSV infection activates ATP1A1 signaling by an unknown mechanism that involves the RSV G protein and does not rely on viral transcription and genome or virus replication. Activation of ATP1A1 leads to transactivation of EGFR that requires c-Src kinase activity. Signaling events downstream of EGFR cause actin rearrangement and ruffling at the plasma membrane, where membrane extensions engulf fluid and RSV into large vesicles-the macropinosomes. RSV is taken up in its enveloped form into the macropinosome, presumably followed by fusion and entry into the host cell. We also provided evidence suggesting that the ATP1A1-Src-EGFR signaling occurs predominantly in the cholesterol-rich domains of the caveolae which are thus important for efficient infection. This study identified ATP1A1 signaling as a new target for the development of anti-RSV drugs. PST2238 in particular is a drug that already has been shown to be well-tolerated in humans, specifically acts on ATP1A1, decreases the efficiency of infection by reducing the RSV-ATP1A1 signaling needed for entry, and could be further developed as an antiviral drug for RSV.",

High throughput screening was performed in 384-well plates (total of 186 plates) using a Bravo VPrep liquid handler within a BioCel automation platform (Agilent). Single siRNAs (0.8 pmol) were added to wells followed by 20 \u03bcl of serum-free medium containing 0.12 \u03bcl Lipofectamine RNAiMax.

ATP1A1 then signals via phosphorylated Src-kinase and transactivates EGFR by its phosphorylation at Tyr845. Upon activation, EGFR signaling causes cytoskeletal rearrangement resulting in plasma membrane ruffling and formation of membrane extensions (reported previously [31, 33, 34] ) that engulf fluid and RSV into macropinosomes. Note that RSV is taken up into the macropinosome in its enveloped state suggesting that it does not fuse at the cell surface; fusion and release of the nucleocapsid likely occurs within the internalized macropinosome. normalization. An siRNA targeting GFP was used as a positive control (16 well per plate) and yielded near-complete elimination of cells scoring positive for GFP.

The expression knock-down siRNA screen was performed by transfecting A549 cells, engineered to express DsRed as a viability marker, with the Ambion Silencer Select Genome-wide siRNA library V4 targeting 21,566 genes, with three independent siRNAs per gene evaluated individually. Forty-eight h post-transfection the cells were infected with 1 PFU/cell of RSV-GFP. The effect of knock-down on GFP expression was measured 48 h post-infection, and the data analyzed as previously described [67] . The median seed corrected Z-scores for all the tested targets is shown. Fig 1. (D) Cell viability. An ATP-based cell viability assay [CellTiter-Glo (Promega)] was performed 72 h p.t. to evaluate the viability of the transfected cells. Cells were lysed, the ATP concentration was determined by ATP-dependent luciferase activity, which was detected with an ELISA reader, and the viability was reported relative to mock-transfected cells assigned the value of 1.0.

The UV wt RSV inoculum was UV-inactivated by 0.5 J/cm 2 UV radiation using a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker 1800 (Agilent). Total inactivation of the inoculum was confirmed by plaque titration on Vero cells.
