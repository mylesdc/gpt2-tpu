Results indicated several positively selected sites located in the region comprising the two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and their linker. Two sites (R652 and V1060) were positively selected in the betaCoVs phylogeny and correspond to mutations associated with expanded host range in other coronaviruses. During the most recent evolution of MERS-CoV, adaptive mutations in the HR1 (Q/R/H1020) arose in camels or in a previous host and spread to humans. We determined that different residues at position 1020 establish distinct inter-and intra-helical interactions and affect the stability of the six-helix bundle formed by the HRs. A similar effect on stability was observed for a nearby mutation (T1015N) that increases MERS-CoV infection efficiency in vitro. Data herein indicate that the heptad repeat region was a major target of adaptive evolution in MERS-CoV-related viruses; these results are relevant for the design of fusion inhibitor peptides with antiviral function.",

MERS-CoV belongs to the clade c of betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) 2 , which also includes two bat sister species, namely Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, isolated from the lesser bamboo bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelles (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively 3 . Additional viruses related to MERS-CoV have been described in bats (BtCoV/KW2E-F93, BtCoV/133) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus coronavirus, EriCoV) 4,5 . Recently, a virus belonging to the same species as MERS-CoV was isolated in Neoromicia bats (NeoCoV), supporting a bat-origin for MERS-CoV 6 . This hypothesis received further confirmation by the identification of dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the cellular receptor used by both Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and MERS-CoV 7-9 .",

We thus analyzed the sequence alignments of the Hong Kong isolates for the presence of recombination breakpoints using GARD. The algorithm detected 9 recombination breakpoints for the Pi-BatCoV HKU5 alignment (Fig. 1A) and none for Ty-BatCoV HKU4. The Ty-BatCoV HKU4 spike gene was therefore analyzed using the codeml site models, which test the hypothesis that a subset of codons evolve with dN/dS > 1. No evidence of positive selection was found, even using the relatively non-conservative model M7/model M8 comparison (Supplementary  Table S4 ). As for the Pi-BatCoV HKU5 spike gene, rampant recombination prevents application of a similar approach. We thus resorted to the simultaneous estimation of selection and recombination using omegaMap 29 . This analysis confirmed high recombination along the whole gene ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and detected a single positively selected site in the S1 region (Fig. 1C ). The same site (codon 198, position relative to the MERS-CoV spike sequence) was also detected by MEME, which was run by incorporating the alternative phylogenies detected by GARD. Most of the previously reported selected sites 28 were not detected using other methods that account for recombination (Supplementary Table S5 ). We thus consider that robust inference of positive selection in Pi-BatCoV HKU5 spike genes can only be made for position 198, which lies outside the RBD (Fig. 1A ).",

It should be noted, though, that in all analyses we applied quite conservative approaches and we intersected two different methods to declare a site as positively selected. Whereas this approach was meant to limit the false positive rate it may have yielded some false negative results. In particular, the branch-site test we used to analyze the S1 and S2 regions of betaCoVs is robust to saturation issues and has a minimal false positive rate, but lacks power 23 . Moreover, due to the high divergence and the consequent need of alignment pruning, analysis of the RBD was performed on a shallower phylogeny compared to the other regions. This procedure is expected to reduce power, but is nonetheless necessary. In fact, alignment errors, together with unrecognized recombination, inflate estimates of positive selection and represent major sources of false positive results in evolutionary analyses 20, 35 . Consistently, when we accounted for recombination in Pi-BatCoV HKU5 sequences most previously described selection signals disappeared, including those in the RBD 28 . Thus, whereas we cannot exclude that adaptive variants in the RBD of betaCoVs were missed by our approach, we conclude that the more recent evolution of MERS-CoV, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 was not driven by positive selection in this domain. Conversely, as previously shown for SARS-CoV 25 , our data support a role for the S1 region separating the RBD and fusion peptide as a determinant of betaCoV host range expansion.",

Overall, these findings pinpoint the relevance of changes in the HR1 and HR2 as modifiers of host range and cell-type tropism. The molecular mechanisms underlying the altered phenotype of HR1 and HR2 mutants remain to be determined in all these instances, although changes in conformational structure have been suggested as a possible explanation. Unfortunately, no coronavirus S protein fusion intermediate or pre-fusion state has been solved to date, hampering investigation of molecular interactions. We therefore analyzed the effect of variation at the 1020 position of MERS-CoV on the stability of the 6HB in the post-fusion conformation 14 . The presence of a Q1020 had previously been suggested to confer higher stability to the MERS-CoV 6HB compared to SARS-CoV 14 . Indeed, replacement of this residue results in loss of intraand inter-helical interactions. In line with these observations, three different methods used for stability analysis were concordant in showing that the alternative arginine and histidine residues at position 1020 result in a moderate and similar level of destabilization. Although the observed \u0394 \u0394 G is relatively small, it was calculated on the single monomer, and is expected to be multiplied in the trimer. The observation whereby mildly destabilizing variants are favored by selection may seem counterintuitive. Nonetheless, we show that a similar level of destabilization is observed for a mutation in MERS-Cov HR1 (T1015N) that increases infection efficiency, at least in vitro 31 . Mutagenesis of HR1 in retroviral type I fusion proteins has indicated that, whereas strong destabilization of the 6HB (as measured by circular dichroism) almost inevitably results in reduced infectivity, a minor stability decrease is not necessarily associated with defects in cell fusion and infection efficiency [40] [41] [42] . For instance, different aminoacid replacements at the same HR1 position in HIV-1 gp41 result in decreased stability, but unaffected or even increased infectivity 40 . In the case of EIAV (equine infectious anemia virus), destabilized HR1 mutants were found to display different infection phenotypes depending on temperature 42 . This observation may be extremely interesting in the context of MERS-CoV, as both bats and dromedary camels display adaptive heterothermy (i.e. sensible daily or season variation in body temperature).",

Recently, different studies identified human antibodies againts MERS-CoV from non-immune human antibody libraries: all of them were directed against the RBD, suggesting that this region represents a major target for the host immune system 43 . Nevertheless, data on the humoral immune response to MERS-CoV in infected subjects are presently lacking, whereas such information is richer for SARS-CoV. Indeed, analysis of antibodies derived from a patient who recovered from SARS indicated that some of them recognize epitopes in the HR2 region 44 . Their neutralizing effect was ascribed to interference of the interaction between HR2 and HR1.

Detection of recombination and positive selection. To detect positive selection at the S gene of clade c betaCoVs we applied the branch-site test from the PAML suite 22 . The test compares a model (MA) that allows positive selection on one or more lineages (foreground lineages) with a model (MA1) that does not allow such positive selection. Twice the difference of likelihood for the two models (\u0394 lnL) is then compared to a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom 22 . Specifically, the internal branches of previously reconstructed 6 Bayesian phylogenies of the S1 and S2 regions were set as the foreground lineages in independent tests. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to account for multiple hypothesis testing (i.e. we corrected for the number of tested branches), as suggested 47 .",

An average block length of 10 and 30 codons was used to estimate \u03c9 and \u03c1 , respectively. To determine the influence of the choice of the priors on the posteriors, analyses were repeated with alternative sets of priors (Supplementary Table S2 ).

The location of positively selected sites detected in MERS-CoV related sequences is shown in red. A positively selected residue in MERS-CoV isolated from humans and camels is in orange. The positively selected site and recombination breakpoints in Pi-BatCoV HKU5 sequences are shown in blue and black, respectively. Furin cleavage sites are depicted as triangles 56 . Two alignment portions are shown; positions that alter virus host range or tropism in SARS-CoV, MHV, and Beaudette strain IBV (IBV Beau CK) are highlighted in green 25-27 . A functional mutation which arose during tissue-culture adaptation of MERS-CoV (strain EMC2012) is highlighted in grey 31 . (B) Bayesian phylogenies for the S1 (left) and S2 (right) sequences 6 ; branch length is proportional to dS. Branches in red were set as foreground lineages in independent branch-site tests.
