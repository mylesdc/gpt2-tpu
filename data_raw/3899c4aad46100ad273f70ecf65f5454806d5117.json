Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus worldwide known as a common human pathogen. This study aims to develop chloroquine-loaded poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanoparticles (CQ-NP) to improve the chloroquine anti-HSV-1 efficacy. CQ-NP were successfully prepared using a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation method. Physicochemical properties of the NP were monitored using dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, drug loading efficiency, and drug release studies. Spherical nanoparticles were produced with modal diameter of <300 nm, zeta potential of \u221220 mv and encapsulation efficiency of 64.1%. In vitro assays of CQ-NP performed in Vero E6 cells, using the MTT-assay, revealed different cytotoxicity levels. Blank nanoparticles (B-NP) were biocompatible. Finally, the antiviral activity tested by the plaque reduction assay revealed greater efficacy for CQ-NP compared to CQ at concentrations equal to or lower than 20 \u00b5g mL \u22121 (p < 0.001). On the other hand, the B-NP had no antiviral activity. The CQ-NP has shown feasible properties and great potential to improve the antiviral activity of drugs.",

This virus, a common human pathogen, is the main cause of oral infection, affecting the mouth and lips. In addition, HSV-1 can be the infectious agent of several diseases including recurrent cold sores, keratoconjunctivitis, and life-threatening herpes encephalitis [1] [2] [3] . Following primary infection, HSV establishes infections in the neurons of the sensory ganglia from where it may become latent in the body [4, 5] . In the nervous system, the virus is protected from the host immune system as a latent state, which can be reactivated by several factors, such as hormonal changes, ultraviolet (UV) light, and mainly the stress [6] . The treatment of infection caused by the HSV-1 include the use of drugs, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, penciclovir, and cidofovirare [7] . Some pharmacokinetic limitations of these drugs can be difficult because of their transport to affected tissues, inducing non-therapeutic drug levels. Moreover, long-term of these treatments may lead to the selection of resistant HSV, being an additional concern mainly for the immunocompromised patients, which has emphasized the need for alternative strategies [8, 9] .",

In addition to the antimalarial activity, CQ has been used to treat chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus [10] [11] [12] . Recently, this drug has also attracted attention due to its anticancer [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and antiviral activity [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In this context, CQ is a hydrophilic drug with low toxicity that has shown some limitations to reach an effective intracellular concentration. One of the main disadvantages of the conventional malaria treatment is the non-specific targeting to intracellular parasites, which leads to high dose administration, resulting in toxicity [25] .",

Among the NDDS, polymeric nanoparticles (NP) is a promising approach to improve drug uptake for a specific cell line. Their advantages include higher stability in biological fluids and easy storage conditions [27, 28] . Polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, which are completely eliminated from the body by natural metabolic pathways.

Nanoprecipitation (solvent displacement method) is a one-step procedure controlled by the interfacial deposition of the polymer after its displacement from organic to aqueous phase. Due to the fast spontaneous diffusion, nanoparticle formation occurs instantaneously. Emulsification-solvent evaporation method is a two-step procedure in which the organic solution is emulsified in the aqueous phase using a high-speed homogenization or ultrasonication.

The experiment with CQ-NP considered a serial dilution (70-2.5 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) to evaluate the effect of NP on the drug toxicity at the same conditions of the anterior experiments ( Figure 3C ). The concentration of 70 \u00b5g mL \u22121 was used as starting point for serial dilution, once cell viability above 80% was achieved after the treatment with a CQ at 62.5 \u00b5g mL \u22121 . As observed for CQ ( Figure 3A,B) , the CQ-NP samples also exhibited a concentration and time-pendent cytotoxicity profile ( Figure 3C ). The NP increased the cytotoxic effect of the drug at the similar concentration range, suggesting greater drug uptake by the cells. The average CC 50 identified for free-CQ drug was more threefold (222.6 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) than that for CQ-NP (67.9 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) ( Table 3 ). In addition, the cell viability \u2265 80% was observed just for concentration levels lower than 30 \u00b5g mL -1 .

Small biodegradable nanoparticles have the ability to overcome biological barriers, such as the efflux cotransport proteins at cell membrane and until brain-blood barrier [26, 29] . In this context, Vero E6 cells were infected with a common human pathogen, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The antiviral activity of CQ has been reported in the literature [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, its anti-HSV-1 activity was not yet been well described. Indeed, due to the similar characteristic with previous described virus infections studies using CQ, a promising effect against HSV-1 infection could be hypothesized using this drug. In addition, its encapsulation in the biodegradable and biocompatible NP could solve its non-specific targeting against intracellular pathogens [25] .",

However, this polymer is a hydrophobic polyester [29] and produce NP for encapsulating hydrophilic drugs, such as the CQ, consists of an interesting challenge [30, 31] . Thus, two different methods of preparation of nanoparticles well applied for this class of polymer were carefully tested. The small size of the system and the drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) were selected as the main performance parameters. Physicochemical properties of the formulations produced by the nanoprecipitation method revealed that the drug/polymer ratio directly affected both particle size and EE% (Table 1) . As expected, the particle size increased according to the polymer concentration in the organic phase. This effect generally improves the EE% of hydrophobic drugs [32, 33, 47, 48] . In contrast to this fact, Formulations 1, 2, and 3 showed low EE%, which decrease with the polymer increment. Chloroquine Diphosphate (CQ) is a low-weight drug with multiple pKas, and solubility behavior dependent on pH. At this pH = 6.4, this hydrophilic compound is unable to favorable interaction with hydrophobic polyesters such as PLA. The increment of PLA leads to drug displacement from organic phase to aqueous phase, resulting in low entrapment efficiency [30] [31] [32] [33] 49] .",

This strategy can potentially improve the EE%, mainly considering hydrophilic drugs [33] . The central drug/polymer ratio of 1:10 was chosen for this purpose. Alkalinizing the aqueous phase (pH = 11.0) with NaOH in the Formulation 4 made possible improve the average EE% from 8.4% to 11.4%.

Considering the emulsification-solvent evaporation method, the EE% level superior to 60% is considered excellent, which induced a slow drug release profile adjusted by the parabolic diffusion mathematical model (r \u2265 0.95) ( Table 2) . This fact suggested a diffusion-controlled transport of CQ from the polymeric matrix of NP [43] . In addition, it is important to note that, on the best of our knowledge, no data in the literature describes the slow chloroquine release from PLA nanoparticles. Previous studies have shown a release of 52.40% of hydroxyl chloroquine sulphate from Eudragit \u00ae RL-100 NP (EE% = 63.14%) at 8 h [54] . The encapsulation of chloroquine diphosphate was described in chitosan NP prepared by ionic gelation technique (EE% = 59.5%), which induced the release of 40% of the drug at 24 h [55] . In the present study, the amount of drug released at 10 h was about 40%, which is much slower than the previously cited studies. In this approach, the residual amount of non-ionized specie of CQ loaded into PLA nanoparticles seems to be strongly interacting with PLA matrix. The parabolic model fitted the experimental data much better (r = 0.95) ( Figure 2E ), which suggested a drug release controlled by diffusion at the first moment. However, the erosion of polymeric matrix of particles should also be considered for release of residual entrapped drug, which could occur in a second moment [44, 48, 49, 51] .",

The CC 50 identified for CQ (222.6 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) and CQ-NP (67.9 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) (Table 3 ) corroborated with this fact. The biocompatible (non-cytotoxic) concentration range of CQ from NP was selected to be used in the following experiment with HSV-1-infected cells.

While these drugs have distinct metabolic pathways, they all act by blocking the synthesis of viral DNA, inhibiting DNA polymerase [58] . Three phosphorylation steps are required for the acyclovir action. The first phosphorylation is performed by the viral thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by the UL23 gene, while subsequent phosphorylation steps are performed by the host cell kinases [59] . Currently, there are some strains of HSV-1 resistant to acyclovir, in which the presence of mutations in UL23 and/or UL30 viral genes responsible for encoding TK and DNA polymerase, were detected [60] . The emergence of new strains resistant to conventional drugs highlight the need for new effective antiviral therapies with novel mechanisms of action [61, 62] .

The CQ has shown pronounced antiviral action against different viruses [64] . The study reported by Koyama and Uchida (1984) demonstrated that the multiplication of the HSV-1 strain HF in Vero cells was inhibited by ammonium chloride and chloroquine. It was also observed that the maturation of the intracellular virus was prevented immediately after the addition of weak bases in the late stage of infection, indicating that the site of inhibition by weak bases is one step in the maturation process of HSV-1 [34] . This present study showed that Vero E6 cells infected with HSV-1 and treated with CQ and CQ-NP at 30 \u00b5g mL \u22121 have 100% of viral replication inhibition after 48 h ( Figure 4A ). At the concentration range from 2.5 to 20 \u00b5g mL \u22121 , the PLA NP significantly improved the anti-HSV-1 of CQ ( Figure 4A ). The CQ-NP induced an IC 50 considerable lesser than that identified for CQ (Table 3 ). In addition, the CQ-NP (at 10 \u00b5g mL \u22121 and 20 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) induced similar HSV-1 viral inhibition than that observed for the positive control, acyclovir, at 20 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ( Figure 4B ).",

The data have demonstrated an efficient nanoencapsulation method, using emulsification-solvent evaporation, able to produce sub-300nm NP, with high EE% of the hydrophilic drug, and able to induce slow CQ release. The experimental results also revealed that CQ-NP induced similar HSV-1 inhibition that observed for the first line of the anti-HSV-1 drug acyclovir.
