The notification was based on a serological diagnosis in a small farm with a morbidity rate of 2.3% without enteric clinical signs. In order to determine if TGEV was circulating before the official report, a retrospective study on cases of neonatal diarrhea was performed. The selection criteria was a sudden increase in mortality in 1-to 21-day-old piglets with watery diarrhea that did not respond to antibiotics. Based on these criteria, three clinical cases were identified during 2010-2015.",

The feces and ultrathin sections of intestine that were evaluated by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of round particles of approximately 80 nm in size and characterized by finely granular electrodense nucleoids consistent with complete particles of coronavirus. The presence of the TGEV antigen was confirmed by monoclonal specific immunohistochemistry, and final confirmation of a metabolically-active virus was performed by in situ hybridization to detect a TGE mRNA encoding spike protein. All sections evaluated in this case were negative for PEDV and rotavirus A. Conclusions: This is the first case series describing neonatal mortality with etiological confirmation of TGEV in Argentina. The clinical diagnosis of TGEV infections in endemic regions is challenging due to the epidemiological distribution and coinfection with other enteric pathogens that mask the clinical presentation.",

Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belong to the Coronaviridae family, Coronavirinae subfamily, and genus Alphacoronavirus [5] . A new coronavirus genetically distinct from TGEV and PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (genus Deltacoronavirus), has recently been associated with enteric disease in pigs [6] . Enteric porcine coronaviruses including TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV are characterized by acute diarrhea and anorexia with rapid dissemination in na\u00efve populations. The severities of clinical diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia can vary based on the age of the affected pigs [7, 8] . Without adequate passive lactogenic immunity, the mortality rate in neonatal piglets can reach up to 100% [1, [9] [10] [11] . Etiological diagnosis relies mainly on molecular tools like PCR and serology, as the clinical signs and enteric lesions associated with TGEV and PEDV are indistinguishable [8, 12, 13] .",

In addition to swine, it has be documented that cats, dogs, and foxes can host TGEV [14] . The virus can be shed in feces for approximately 18 months, and milk shedding from infected sows can result in vertical transmission. Historically, TGEV infection has followed a seasonal pattern, becoming more prevalent during winter months perhaps due to increased viral survival in colder temperatures and with less exposure to sunlight. TGEV is susceptible to most commercial disinfectants, but resistant to digestive bile and stable at pH 3 [1] . Only one TGEV genotype has been described, however differences in pathogenicity among strains has been reported in field outbreaks, although not confirmed by an experimental study [12] .",

In epidemics, TGEV enters a na\u00efve herd and all pig categories are affected, particularly piglets that are 1-2 weeks old. The duration of the clinical presentation is short, approximately 3 weeks, and in small, farrow-to-finish herd, the infection can be self-limiting [1, 14] . Endemic disease scenarios, those occurring after the epidemic phase, are observed in farms with incomplete AIAO management or in breeding farms that have a continuous flow of na\u00efve gilts. In breeding herds, the varying levels of humoral and lactogenic immunity lowers piglet mortality, but may lengthen the course of the disease [1] .",

            "text": "The epidemiological and clinical presentations of outbreaks of neonatal mortality associated with enteritis and the detection of TGEV started in the gestation units. Both gilts and sows showed anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting before enteric signs were observed in neonatal piglets. However, the prevalence of clinical signs in the breeding stock was low and no mortality was reported. When TGEV enters in a na\u00efve herds, an epizootic form characterized by a 100% mortality of pre-weaning piglets due to diarrhea and dehydration is normally observed [1, 14] . Although in the present study, the farms had a high prevalence of diarrhea in suckling pigs, only farms A and C showed almost 100% neonatal mortality, while in farm B had approximately 20% neonatal mortality. The clinical presentation and epidemiological pattern observed in farm B resembled the TGE endemic form. Although no other etiological diagnosis was confirmed, the low mortality associated with TGEV that was observed in farm B might be the result of previous exposure to PRCV. PRCV infection can confer cross-protection against TGEV, reducing the enteric clinical signs and pre-weaning mortality [12] . Therefore, herds concomitantly infected with PRCV and TGEV develop less severe clinical signs, making the clinical differentiation from other enteric infections such as rotavirus or E. coli infections more challenging [1, 14] . Another potential reason for the low mortality rate due to TGE infection that was observed in farm B could be the intermittent viral exposure of the breeding stock that provided partial immunity to the neonatal piglets [14] . In all herds in this study, it was suspected that the virus entered the farms through the subclinically infected replacement animals Although the pre-weaning mortality rate in farm B was lower than that in farm A and C, the pre-weaning mortality was higher in this farm than the mortality rate seen in similar production systems due to other enteric causes such us I suis [19, 23] , C. perfringes type A [24] , or C. difficile [25] . According to a previous study, the pre-weaning mortality due to diarrhea should not exceed 20% [26] . Usually, in porcine CoVs infections, the course of the clinical disease is short and normally does not exceed 3-4 weeks [14] due to the establishment of a rapid herd immunity, as early as one week post-infection. However, in farm B the clinical presentation persisted for approximately 2 months. Potential reinfection due to poor husbandry and incomplete AIAO management are just few potential causes of viral persistence in the environment that can predispose reinfection of the farrowing units.",

However, TGEV infection is segmental, so multiple segments should be included for histopathology or etiological diagnoses in situ such as IHC or ISH-RNA. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, fixed tissue was used to confirm the presence of TGEV and the morphological changes consistent with viral infection in the intestinal mucosa. It is important to highlight that although TGEV was detected by different means in each farm, due to the segmental nature of the lesions and viral distribution, viral ARN or viral antigen was not detected in all of the intestinal segments that were evaluated. In piglets that are less than 2 weeks old, the reduction of villus length and the fusion of jejunum and proximal ileum are the main histological changes [27] . The normal villous/crypt length ratio is 7:1, however, after 24-48 h post-infection, the villous/ crypt ratio can be reduced to 2:1 or 1:1 [27] . Since TGEV replicates in mature absorptive epithelial cells [28] , a false negative diagnosis can be observed by IHC or ISH in specimens that display villous shortening. Few absorptive vacuolated cells are seen normally in the intestine, however, during TGEV infection, they are found in great numbers with a cuboidal shape [27] . In endemic TGEV infection, histopathological diagnosis is more difficult because only 25% of pigs display typical TGE lesions. In addition, immunofluorescence tests and IHC often fail in endemic farms due to a low number of enterocytes in the TGEV-infected because of partial protection conferred by colostral antibodies [23, 29] . Different diagnostic techniques have been used to detect TGEV infection such as IHC, ISH, electron microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy and PCR [13] ; however, histopathology remains the most useful tool for screening diagnosis [18] . In this study, although all cases were selected using clinical features and epidemiological information, the histological evaluation consistently showed lesions compatible with viral infection.",

In addition reported mortality should be associated with the presence of watery diarrhea in 1-to 21-day-old piglets that did not respond to antibiotics. First screening of cases was done by histopathological evaluation, and only cases presenting features of viral enteritis with no other detected pathogen were included. Based on these criteria, three clinical cases were identified from 2010 to 2015.",
