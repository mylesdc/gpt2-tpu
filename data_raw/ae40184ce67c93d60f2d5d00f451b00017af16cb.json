Persistence and spread of resistant strains within a population contribute to the maintenance of a reservoir and lead to treatment failure. An experimental trial was carried out to study the horizontal transmission of a fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strain from inoculated to na\u00efve pigs. All na\u00efve contact pigs had positive counts of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli after only two days of contact. Moreover, re-infections of inoculated pigs caused by newly contaminated animals were suspected. A maximum likelihood method, based on a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model, was used to determine the transmission parameters. Two transmission levels were identified depending on the quantity of bacteria shed by infected individuals: (i) low-shedders with bacterial counts of resistant E. coli in the faeces between 5*10 3 and 10 6 CFU/g (b L = 0.41 [0.27; 0.62]), (ii) high shedders with bacterial counts above 10 6 CFU/g (b H = 0.98 [0.59; 1.62]). Hence, transmission between animals could be pivotal in explaining the persistence of resistant bacteria within pig herds.",

The selection, persistence and spread of such strains within a population is often puzzling and can lead to failures of the usual treatments against infections [2] . Moreover, administration of antimicrobial agents used in human medicine to production animals, such as fluoroquinolones, could lead to the emergence of public health issues due to the persistence and dissemination of resistant bacteria [3] . Although surveillance of resistance in zoonotic bacteria has a direct implication on public health policies, monitoring bacteria from the commensal flora, such as Escherichia coli strains, remains a good indicator of the resistance pattern within a population. Knowledge of the resistance pattern in such commensal bacteria is pivotal because of the risk of transmission of resistant genes from non-pathogenic to zoonotic bacteria [4] .",

[6] observed that quinolone treatment caused a strong selective pressure in the E. coli population of the treated sows and their piglets. In this study, the treatment was routinely administered to pregnant sows around farrowing-time. Even though the effects were transitory, the faecal flora of the piglets was clearly modified by the treatment of their dams, leading to a dramatic increase in the within-host proportion of resistant E. coli. The long-term impact of such routine practices of antimicrobial use is unknown, but enrichment of the resistant flora with duration of use is highly suspected [7] .

To the best of our knowledge, only one of these modelling approaches focussed on the impact of antimicrobial consumption on the emergence and/or transmission of resistant strains within a finisher pig herd [13] . This study highlighted the need for a modelling framework which incorporates both current knowledge of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in animals and the key factors which can be used to characterize within-herd dynamics of resistant bacteria under the influence of antimicrobial pressure. Knowledge of the transmission dynamics of resistant bacteria would improve the understanding of the influence of on-site farming practices (drug usage, infection control) on the dynamics of resistant bacteria in animals and could also form the basis for a release assessment (component of a risk assessment). Abatih et al. [13] used a deterministic SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) model in which infectious individuals were divided into two sub-groups (I I and I R ) according to their levels of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The authors concluded that the persistence of resistant bacteria within the finishers was strongly related to the transmission parameter values [13] .",

Experimental transmission trials provide a useful tool for assessing infection dynamics in a controlled environment [14] . Different estimation methods have been used to analyse results from transmission experiments: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ), generalised linear model (GLM, [20] [21] [22] ) or Becker's martingale formulae based on the final size of the epidemics [14, 23, 24] .

Each group was conducted separately and between-group transmission was avoided by having a solid partition between pens. Inoculations were performed orally, by successively administering 10 mL of a bacterial suspension (10 9 CFU/mL), on the day prior to contact with SPF pigs and on the contact-day. Contact was instigated by mixing the inoculated and na\u00efve pigs about four hours after the second inoculation.",

The selection of E. coli with chromosomal mutations was performed by spreading a large amount of inoculum (about 10 9 CFU) onto plates supplemented with increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin (Sigma/Fluka, St-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin for the selected resistant strain was 1.5 mg/L (E-test, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France). The suspension was administered using a soft sterile catheter which was gently but deeply introduced into the oesophagus to prevent the inoculum from flowing back and further contaminating the environment. All pigs were monitored daily by taking faecal samples from the day preceding inoculation until 4 days postinoculation and then every 2 days until day 10. Clinical signs were also recorded daily and the pigs were weighed once a week. Bacterial counts were measured on 1 g of faeces using serial 10-fold dilutions. One hundred microliters of each dilution were plated on chromogenic agar (Chromocult Agar ES, Merck/VWR, Strasbourg, France) supplemented with 0.5 mg/L of ciprofloxacin (Sigma/Fluka, St-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h then the colonies were counted. This method allowed quantification of the concentrations of inoculated E. coli greater than or equal to 10 2 CFU/g of faeces.",

An inverse trend, with an increase in bacterial counts, was observed in 13 of the 23 inoculated pigs between day 4 and day 10 post-contact.

Although the emergence and selection of antimicrobial-resistance can be linked with antimicrobial consumption [29] , the transmission of resistant bacteria between individuals could be a pivotal factor governing persistence within a pig herd. Such transmission may occur in swine herds when mixing pigs which have been treated or not, or litters derived from treated and non-treated sows. As very few observations and no parameter estimates were available for the passive horizontal transmission of resistant commensal bacteria between animals [13] , an experimental trial was designed to study the transmission of fluoroquinoloneresistant E. coli from inoculated to na\u00efve pigs, in the absence of selective pressure. When studying a natural infection, the use of contact animals, rather than artificially inoculated animals with a presumed higher infectiousness, has been recommended to start the infection chain under study [30] . Only artificially inoculated pigs were used in the present experiment, in order to limit the number of pigs involved. However, the amounts of resistant bacteria shed by inoculated pigs on the day of contact were within the range observed in treated animals [31] or in piglets born to treated sows [6] . In addition, no significant difference was found between the amounts of bacteria shed by inoculated and contact pigs. The present results can therefore be considered as realistic and representative of the transmission pattern occurring under field conditions. Moreover, to date no plasmidmediated quinolone resistance has been reported in E. coli isolates from pigs in France, so this observation can be considered as consistent with the current epidemiological on-farm situation.",

However, the method used in the present study is based on the classical hypotheses of the SIR epidemiological model, accounting for horizontal transmission between individuals. The roles of environmental and airborne transmissions were not considered and would need further investigation. Three shedding-levels were considered in the present study, resulting in 3 nested models to allow for heterogeneous transmission rates. Transmission by lowshedders was indeed 2.5 times less efficient than that of high-shedders. The role of variations in individual infectiousness on the course of infection has been highlighted in several studies. Indeed, transmission rates could be influenced by several factors such as timesince-infection [16, 17, 32] or individual bacterial counts [33] . The role of super-spreaders was clearly identified for different infectious agents (e.g. MRSA [34] , E. coli O157:H7 [35] , Salmonella [36] ). As transmission rates were found to be related to the individual bacterial counts, modelling the dynamics of drug-resistant bacteria within a pig herd would require representing the within-host dynamics of the bacterial population accounting for different susceptibility levels [37, 38] . Such a modelling approach should take into account the resistance mechanisms of bacteria to targeted antibacterial agents (plasmidic or chromosomal genes) and the impact of selective pressure exerted by antimicrobial exposure. To this end, the within-host bacterial population model, accounting for the pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic aspect, could be coupled with an epidemiological model representing the spread of resistance within the population. Such a model would allow the identification of key management and treatment strategies that could limit or prevent the spread of resistant strains between individuals. The present study, focussing on the transmission of an E. coli strain harbouring chromosomal resistance to fluoroquinolones, could be a cornerstone for the development of this pharmaco-epidemiological model.
