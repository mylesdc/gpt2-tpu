            "text": "Background: Strain-level RNA virus characterization is essential for developing prevention and treatment strategies. Viral metagenomic data, which can contain sequences of both known and novel viruses, provide new opportunities for characterizing RNA viruses. Although there are a number of pipelines for analyzing viruses in metagenomic data, they have different limitations. First, viruses that lack closely related reference genomes cannot be detected with high sensitivity. Second, strain-level analysis is usually missing. Results: In this study, we developed a hybrid pipeline named TAR-VIR that reconstructs viral strains without relying on complete or high-quality reference genomes. It is optimized for identifying RNA viruses from metagenomic data by combining an effective read classification method and our in-house strain-level de novo assembly tool. TAR-VIR was tested on both simulated and real viral metagenomic data sets. The results demonstrated that TAR-VIR competes favorably with other tested tools. Conclusion: TAR-VIR can be used standalone for viral strain reconstruction from metagenomic data. Or, its read recruiting stage can be used with other de novo assembly tools for superior viral functional and taxonomic analyses. The source code and the documentation of TAR-VIR are available at https://github.com/chjiao/TAR-VIR.",

Thus, characterizing human viral pathogens, including recognizing novel ones, remains crucial. Development of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies sheds lights on characterizing the virus composition in both natural environmental and clinical samples. In particular, viral metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to circumvent the need for virus isolation and cultivation, can conduct comprehensive sequencing of all viruses in a sample. Thus, multiple viruses, including new ones, can be identified in viral metagenomic sequencing data.",

Accurate RNA virus characterization needs to assembly the reads into strain-specific contigs for downstream taxonomic and functional analyses.

Thus, a commonly adopted strategy is to classify reads into different biological entities such as species before conducting assembly.",

The sequencing depths for Influenza and HBV are 700-x and 300-x, respectively. All the data sets were simulated by ART-illumina [24] as error-containing MiSeq pairedend reads, with the read length of 250 bp, the average insert size of 600 bp, and the standard deviation of 150 bp. In total, there are 173,703 simulated reads, of which 119,002 reads are from the five SARS-CoV haplotypes.",

In particular, with the parameter \"-B 1\", BWA can align slightly more reads than what Bowtie2 can recruit with the parameter \"L, 0, -0.9\" ((52,688 vs. 52,377). The recruited reads (52,377), however, cover 20%-30% more genomes for the five haplotypes. This indicates that alignmentbased methods tend to identify reads sequenced from highly similar regions between the target and the reference viruses, while the recruitment method is more The \"Alignment\" section contains results for aligned reads. The \"Recruitment\" section contains results for recruited reads by TAR-VIR using the aligned reads. For each row, the aligned reads in \"Alignment\" section are the seed set for the recruited reads in \"Recruitment\" section. For Bowtie2, the \"-score-min\" parameter was set to allow different alignment error rates corresponding to 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. For BWA, \"-A\" is fixed as its default value 1. \"-B\" was modified to allow different error rate similar to Bowtie2. \"Number\" is the number of aligned or recruited reads. \"Depth\" is the average sequencing coverage. \"Coverage\" is the percentage of genome covering by at least one read. h1 to h5 represent the five SARS-CoV haplotypes likely to obtain reads from the whole genome of the target viruses. Worth noting is all the recruited reads are from SARS-CoV (no contamination from Influenza and HBV). Figure 1a and b compared the genome coverage of seed reads and recruited reads. Directly aligning the reads to the bat coronavirus covers only a small proportion of the whole genome (Fig. 1a) , leading to incomplete assembly. Using these aligned reads as seeds, TAR-VIR is able to recruit many more reads that nearly cover the whole genome of SARS-Cov, as shown in Fig. 1b . Table 1 also shows that the numbers of recruited reads do not heavily rely on the number of the seed reads. Even when the seed set is small (e.g. the seed sets constructed using Bowtie2), many new reads can be recruited during each iteration. After multiple iterations, the final set of recruited reads can be significantly larger than the seed set, bounded by the sequencing depth of the haplotypes. On the other hand, if the seed sets contain many reads from non-relevant species, the final set of recruited reads could even include all the reads from the input, which makes the read recruiting useless. Because of this, we prefer to construct the seed set using glocal mode to ensure high quality.",

For example, when BWA (\"-B 8, -A 1\") was used to generate the seed set, roughly 3.5 million reads were recruited, while a portion of them can be aligned to other genomes (such as phages). Although BWA's output can be processed to remove local alignments, the seed set can be more reliably produced using Bowtie2's output. Therefore, Bowtie2 was chosen as the aligner for all real data experiments. We downloaded the reference genomes of HBV (NC_003977.2), multiple genotypes of HCV (NC_009827.1, NC_009823.1, NC_009825.1, NC_030791.1, NC_004102.1, NC_009826.1, NC_009824.1), and human pegivirus (HPgV, NC_001710.1) from the viral genome database of NCBI. The preprocessed reads were then aligned to the references under mismatch rates of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. These initially aligned reads were used as the seed read sets. Although there are multiple genotypes for HCV, only genotype 1 has a decent amount of aligned reads. Other genotypes have less than 50 reads mapped. Thus, to produce a reliable evaluation of the assembly results, only the results of HCV genotype 1 were used. The numbers of reads before and after read recruiting are shown in Table 4 . As this is a real metagenomic data set without known ground truth of the viral haplotypes, the evaluation metrics for read recruiting are different from the simulation data set. We cannot evaluate whether every recruited read is correct because its originating location is unknown. Thus, instead of evaluating the depth and genome coverage for each haplotype, we focus on evaluating whether using recruited reads can improve the performance of genome assembly.",

The assembly results demonstrate that the reads recruited by TAR-VIR usually improve the assembly results by producing longer contigs and higher genome coverage for PEHaplo, SGA, and SPAdes. The improvement is not simply due to the increased number of reads after the recruitment stage. For example, according to Table 4 , by using 15% mismatch rate, the recruited reads are less than the aligned reads under 20% mismatch rate (263,029 vs. 294,448). However, the assembly results using the recruited reads are better than or comparable to the results using the aligned reads for all the assembly tools. Among the four assemblers used, PEHaplo of TAR-VIR and SPAdes produced good results with large N50 and high genome coverage. SGA generated larger number of contigs with low N50 value. While we have tried the best parameters for SAVAGE based on our empirical experience, its results are not consistent with the other three tools. Better parameters may exist for SAVAGE to produce better results. However, the long-running time and high memory usage of this tool made continuing to tune the parameters difficult.",

If local mode is chosen, users should screen the read mapping results using alignment length and score. A related issue is the choice of the overlap threshold. We have provided guidance on choosing appropriate overlap cutoffs based on the analysis of the common string sizes between different species. However, when the sequencing coverage is low, a smaller overlap threshold should be used. This is a similar problem to choosing overlap threshold or kmer size for assembly.

The false positive rate (FPR) for a given size l defines the probability that two different microbial species have an LCS at least l. TPR can be derived using the area size in Additional file 1: Figure  S1 (D) while FRP can be computed using Additional file 1: Figure S1 (A)-(C). The final ROC curve has a AUC close to 1, which is expected because of the small overlap between the LCS values for haplotypes and different species. The ROC curve is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2 . Meanwhile, because there are 142,021,586 pairs of viruses vs. other microbes, which can lead to a very small FPR value, we thus also show the actual number of virus-vs-other pairs with LCS size above l in Additional file 1: Figure  S3 . For example, there are 86 virus-vs-other pairs (out of 142,021,586) with LCS value above 100 bp. In practice, not all these microbes live in the same niche and thus are included in the same metagenomic data set. Thus, this is the worst-case contamination analysis using characterized genomes.

These chimeras may have overlaps with more than one species, thus introducing contamination from the host or unrelated microbes. Figure 3a illustrates how contamination can be introduced via chimeric reads. In our experiments, we set the overlap threshold longer than half of the read size to prevent recruiting these chimeric reads or extending from them. To justify our choice of the overlap threshold for preventing contamination via chimeric reads, consider a chimeric read that is a concatenation of the sequences from the target virus and another species. There are two cases. In the first case, if the region from the target virus is shorter than half of the read size, this chimeric read will not be recruited. In the second case, if the region from the target virus is longer than half of the read size, this chimeric read will be recruited. However, as the other part of this chimeric read must be shorter than half of the read size (i.e. overlap threshold), this read will not be extended in the next iteration. Figure 3b shows this case. If the chimeric read contains regions from more than two species, it becomes harder for this read to form an overlap above the cutoff with reads from the target virus.",
