            "text": "Technology for comprehensive identification of biothreats in environmental and clinical specimens is needed to protect citizens in the case of a biological attack. This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the nearneighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry.",

            "text": "Technology for detecting biothreat agents requires accurate identification of a broad array of bacterial and viral organisms that can cause severe disease and/or death, whether they occur as a result of a biological attack or from a natural source in the environment. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has compiled a list of priority pathogens for biodefense (http://www.niaid.nih.gov) and several of these are also defined as select agents (http://www.selectagents.gov/) by various agencies such as Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (some of the vaccine and live attenuated strains are, however, excluded from the select agents list: http://www.selectagents.gov/Select%20 Agents%20and%20Toxins%20Exclusions.html). These bioagents are often virtually indistinguishable from a group of phylogenetically related species or subspecies often referred to as ''near neighbors'' [1] . Near neighbors to biothreat agents may be human pathogens or harmless environmental organisms. The biothreat agent along with its near neighbors can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or biocluster for short. When monitoring for biothreat agents, it is important to determine whether any organisms from the biothreat clusters are present and to precisely identify the organism as a biothreat agent or a near neighbor. In some cases, the near neighbors are commonly found in the environment, and it is possible that a pathogenic near neighbor of a biothreat agent might deliberately be chosen for use in a biological attack. Thus, effective biosensor technology must be capable of identifying a broad array of biothreat agents and distinguishing these threats from their near neighbors unambiguously.",

            "text": "This requirement presents a problem for conventional molecular methods where specific PCR is used in conjunction with probes to detect specific bioagents. Not only are potentially pathogenic near neighbors present in a specimen often not distinguished, but the near neighbors sometimes react to produce false positives for the biothreat agent. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new strategy for biothreat identification that couples biothreat cluster-specific PCR amplification to electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) [2] [3] [4] . The biothreat assay is performed on a hardware platform with prototypes known as TIGER [4] and as the Ibis T5000 [2, 5] that is now marketed commercially as the Abbott PLEX-ID [6] . In the PCR/ESI-MS approach, PCR primers are designed to amplify regions of the genomes of all species from the entire biothreat cluster, encompassing groups of organisms that include the biothreat and the associated near-neighbor organisms. The primers are designed to target genomic regions sufficiently conserved such that amplification occurs comprehensively within a biothreat cluster, but not outside of the cluster. The amplification products are then analyzed by mass spectrometry, which weighs the amplicons with sufficient mass accuracy that the base composition of A, G, C, and T nucleotides that make up the amplicon can be accurately counted. The base composition serves as a signature of each organism and enables identification and discrimination of the biothreat agents and their near neighbors with equal facility. In addition, previously undiscovered or newly emerging organisms from within these biothreat clusters are also detected. The database of signatures against which multiple additional pathogens could be identified increases over time as newer strain variants are archived and tested. An example of this was the discovery of the 2009 H1N1 virus by the Naval Health Research Center [7, 8] ; this offered the first characterization of a previously unrecognized influenza strain, demonstrating the capability of the PLEX-ID in identification of a real-world case of novel pathogen emergence. Because the mass spectrometer weighs all amplicons presented to it, the amplicons from unexpected or new organisms are detected and identified [2, 5, 9, 10] .",

The primers used for the detection of these two plasmids (BCT2379 and BCT2381) were chosen to capture a previously described single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [17] . This region in each of the plasmids provides two different alleles that can be used to distinguish B. anthracis Ames and other Ames-like strains from non-Ames strains.

As predicted, the Ameslike strains were different from the rest of the B. anthracis strains in the pXO1 and pXO2 loci. An additional 89 strains of B. anthracis were obtained from the Keim Genetics Lab; these strains have various phylogenetic variations (Table S2 ). The diverse strains in this collection were correctly identified in our assay. The A1.a clade showed the SNP pattern at the sspE locus previously associated with the western North American lineage (Table S3) . These strains were previously reported to be distinct from other Clade A strains as they contain a 153-bp allele in the CG3 locus [17] .",

None of these carried the virulence plasmids pXO1 or pXO2 (data not shown). Futher, the base compositions observed for the two genomic markers showed distinct signatures compared to B. anthracis. The amplicon for sspE showed a 6-bp deletion compared to the B. anthracis signatures, whereas the infB signature was the same length but had a different base composition. Based on the combined compositions of these two primer regions, the B. cereus/ B. thuringiensis biocluster could be divided into 29 distinct genotypes. Some of the B. thuringiensis species have individual clusters but most are related to B. cereus species. Several studies over the past two decades have looked at the fine structure of the B. cereus clade and have reported similar findings [18] . Nucleic acids from species outside the B. cereus clade, such as B. subtilis and B. megaterium, were not amplified with the sspE primer pair. The advantage of measuring multiple signatures across the genome and in associated plasmids is that this provides sufficient information to characterize the biothreat agent (i.e., vaccine vs. virulent strains of B. anthracis) as well as distinguish it from its near-neighbors.",

            "text": "Yersinia pestis. The bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis is a highly contagious disease that persists endemically in many countries in the world with unpredictable resurgences [19] . Y. pestis is classified as a biothreat agent. It is a nonmotile, capsulated, Gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans and susceptible animals through flea bites or aerosols. Other species in this biocluster include Y. enterocolitica (a diarrheagenic pathogen), Y. frederiksenii, Y. ruckeri, and Y. pseudotuberculosis (an enteric pathogen). Y. pseudotuberculosis exhibits more than 90% genomic homology with Y. pestis, making much of the Y. pestis genome unsuitable for amplification as base composition signatures do not resolve Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis [20, 21] . Two specific markers within the Y. pestis genome were identified that provide differentiation from Y. pseudotuberculosis. One of these is located in the valyl-tRNA synthetase gene (valS). This region (Table 1 ) has a SNP that is retained in all the Y. pestis genomes studied to date and that is distinct from the Y. pseudotuberculosis signature for this region ( Table   Figure 1 . Biothreat clusters of interest. Ten bacterial and four viral clusters identified in the biothreat assay are shown. In each cluster the key biothreat agent and its near neighbors are indicated. The HHS/USDA select agent and NIAID A, B, C pathogen lists are reflected by symbols shown in the legend. Attenuated or live vaccine strains of some of these organisms are, however, excluded from the select agent list (http://www.selectagents. gov/Select Agents and Toxins Exclusions.html). B. anthracis and Y. pestis plasmid markers are explicitly annotated. Organisms with names given within brackets cannot be distinguished from each other within this assay. Primer pairs used for the detection of each biocluster are indicated. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036528.g001 S4). A second primer pair was designed to target the invasin gene invA, a surface-expressed protein that is reponsible for cellular penetration and invasion. Although both Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica contain intact invasin genes, the central region of the Y. pestis inv gene is disrupted by a 708-bp IS200-like element [22] . Primers targeting this region allow for the unambiguous detection of Y. pestis (Table S4 ). In addition, Y. pestis harbors plasmids that are required for the expression of virulence [23] [24] [25] [26] . Primer pairs targeted against the pla gene from the pPCP1 plasmid of Y. pestis and the caf1 gene from the pMT1 plasmid of Y. pestis were included in the assay to provide specific detection of virulence plasmidcarrying Y. pestis. Genomic data from the completely sequenced Y. pestis genomes were used to verify the expected signatures for these primer pairs (Table S4 ). All Y. pestis strains for which relevant sequence was available in GenBank showed identical base composition signatures. Partially virulent Y. pestis strains such as Y. pestis Angola (PLA+/CAF2) and pestoides F (PLA2/CAF+) were correctly identified. These results were further confirmed by experimental testing a collection of seven Y. pestis strains with known phenotypes obtained from the USAMRIID culture collection (Table S5 ). In addition to the four virulent phenotypes containing PLA+/CAF+, two strains (Nairobi and Java 9) lacking the caf gene and pestoides F lacking the pla gene were analyzed. All of the results showed data consistent with the expected molecular signatures. Finally, a set of 15 near neighbors of Y. pestis were tested using the assay; each was correctly identified and differentiated from the Y. pestis signatures (Table S6 ). In particular, this assay clearly distinguished the Y. pestis signatures from those of Y. pseudotuberculosis, which is often the confounder in molecular assays.",

F. tularensis has been divided into three subspecies: F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A), which is divided into subtypes A.I and A.II., is the most virulent and is found primarily in North America and Europe [29] . F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (type B) is less virulent and found in Europe and in Asia [28] , F. tularensis subsp. mediaasiatica has been isolated only in Central Asia and is considered to be of lower virulence [30] . The latter two subspecies can cause an incapacitating infection, however [30] . The near-neighbor species F. novicida (considered by some investigators to be another subspecies of F. tularensis) and F. philomiragia are reportedly of of low pathogenicity and cause disease only in immunocompromised humans [30] . Because of the potential of each of these species and subspecies to cause disease of varying severity, it is important to both detect and distinguish these species and subspecies.",

Use of galE for identification of Francisella genus has been previously described [31] . Based on inspection of the sequence alignments for these genes of all available Francisella sequences, both of these primer pairs are expected to generate amplicons from all known members of the Francisella genus. Base composition analysis of the expected amplicons shows that Francisella species and subspecies are distinguishable from each other (Table S7 ). F. tularensis base counts are characterized by a homogenous signature for all type A.I strains. Schu S4 is the type strain, and the rest of the Francisella signatures are defined here as variations compared to this reference strain. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis str. WY96-3128 (type A.II) had a T to C SNP in the galE primer pair region. The same signature was observed for F. tularensis subsp. mediaasiatica FSC217 strain. This is in agreement with genome-wide SNP analysis, which indicates that differentiation of these particular strains likely predated the acquisition of the asd or galE mutations that characterize the subspecies. Further, the subspecies mediaasiatica is reported to be closer to the Type A.II lineage, even though its pathogenicity is characteristic of the Type B strains [29] . F. tularensis subspecies novicida was distinguished by a G to A mutation from the consensus seen in F. tularensis signature from primer pair BCT2332.",

Included were members of all phylogenetic lineages within the Francisella biocluster. Francisella species were correctly identified and grouped into phylogenetic clades. All 34 Type A.I subspecies yielded identical base compositions for both primer pairs consistent with the predicted amplicons from the Schu S4 genome. Twelve of the type B, subspecies holarctica strains had signatures that differed from the Type A.I subspecies in both the primer pairs, clearly differentiating the two major groups of the Francisella genus. Type A.II strain signatures were different from the Type A.I signatures by a single T to C SNP in the galE primer amplicon, consistent with the genome sequence of Francisella subsp. tularensis strain WY96-3128. However, two of the Type B strains tested, FRAN041 (Strain JAP-Cincinnati) and FRAN011 (Strain LR) could not be distinguished from the Type A.II subspecies using these two primer pairs. As described above, this signature appears to be consistent with subsp. mediaasiatica strains as well. Sequence similarities between the Type B Japanese strains, F. tularensis mediaasiatica and Type A.II lineages were previously noted ( [29] , Duncan, manuscript in preparation). The F. novicida strain (FRAN003) differed from Type A.I by a single SNP in the galE region, whereas the species outlier, F. philomiragia, was clearly different from the rest of the F. tularensis biocluster in both primer regions. The asd primer pair produced the expected amplicon for all strains of F. philomiragia. In contrast, the galE locus primer pair did not yield an amplicon for all strains. This region in a recently sequenced F. philomiragia strain (ATCC 25017) has mismatches to the primer regions (Genbank Accession Number NC_010336). Even without data from the asd primer pair, the differentiation of this species from other F. tularensis was unambiguous. Based on the two primer analysis done here, Francisella strains could be categorized into five groups: Types ''A.I,'' ''B,'' ''novicida,'' ''philomiragia,'' and a fifth group that contains strains within the Type A.II/mediaasiatica/holarctica/ Japanese lineages that might have diverged before the acquisition of the asd and galE mutations.",

There are at least five pathotypes of E. coli: enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Symptoms caused by these organisms are often similar, and these organisms are difficult to differentiate by genomic analysis.",

In addition, this primer pair also provides species resolution of Yersinia as discussed previously. The base count clusters shown in Table S14 demonstrate the ability of this primer pair to amplify members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and to provide species-level differentiation of Salmonella from E. coli and Shigella, although the Shigella species base counts are indistinguishable from a group of the E. coli strains using this primer pair (PLEX-ID cluster 5, Table  S14 ). This is consistent with the previously described phylogenetic relationship of these bacteria [39] . Importantly, the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 species is clearly differentiated from all other Enterobacteriaceae except enteropathogenic E. coli O55:H7, strain 5905 (BC cluster 1). This strain is considered the immediate ancestor of the E. coli O157:H7 lineage and contains the shiga toxin, which is atypical for other E. coli O55:H7 strains [40] . The Salmonella species are divided into several clusters, but cannot be grouped according to the subspecies nomenclature based on data from this assay. These pathogens can be resolved in a more targeted food-borne bacteria assay (manuscript in preparation).",

In April 2009, a previously unseen virus emerged and rapidly spread globally leading to the first influenza pandemic of the 21 st century.

Fivefold serial dilutions of nucleic acid samples (with a high concentration of 1000 GE/well for all targets except VEEV which was 5000 GE/well) of the nucleic acid extracts from all the target organisms were prepared and 10 replicates of each dilution of each agent were analyzed. The presumptive LOD was ascribed to be the lowest concentration resulting in 10 correct identifications and detections in all primer pairs targeting each biothreat cluster ( Figure S4 ). Additional replicates were analyzed (as many as 105) to allow for sufficient data to determine the LOD with a 95% confidence interval. These measured LODs were used for subsequent analysis. Nucleic acids from test organisms were paired to reduce overall sample numbers (for example, B. anthracis and vaccinia virus nucleic acids were spiked together and analyzed in the same sample). These LOD studies were preceded by analysis of synthetic constructs, plasmids containing DNA sequences similar to those of the biothreat agents. These constructs were carefully measured using real-time PCR assays targeting the plasmid backbone (data not shown). Using this synthetic approach, the LOD for the various target primer pairs in the biothreat assay were determined to be between 7 and 250 genome equivalents (GE) per well, with most organisms detected at between 15 and 62.5 GE/well ( Figure S4 ). The outliers were the three RNA virus groups, which showed either 125 or 250 GE/well LOD.",

At the LODs, false negative rates were less than 5% for 14 of the agents used to challenge the biothreat assay kit and less than 10% for two of the agents.

First, over 1000 samples containing environmental background without a specific target agent were analyzed and used to calculate false positive rates for each agent.

For example, in the LOD determination of B. anthracis, the sample contained nucleic acids extracted from the environmental collection and from B. anthracis and vaccinia virus. Because those samples did not contain any of the other 14 threat agents, the data from the analysis of those samples could be used to calculate the false positive rate. The false positive rates for each of the threat agents tested was 0%, except for Rickettsia prowazekii, which was 14% ( Table 4 ). The matrix that was used as background had high loads of environmental bacterial signatures (data not shown), including alphaproteobacteria such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. These might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. Higher background prevalence of some of the potential biothreat agents or their near neighbors in certain regions of the world might similarly affect other detections. For instance, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is described as a highly distributed soil saprophyte in southeast Asia would result in higher rates of reporting of this organism.",

The assay also identifies a broad range of near-neighbor organisms that may cause severe disease in humans or animals or that may be harmless environmental organisms. The biothreat cluster analysis strategy using PCR/ESI-MS addresses several fundamental design requirements for biothreat protection. First, biothreat agents and near-neighbor organisms are identified unambiguously and equally. Closely related organisms often cause false alarms in conventional PCR approaches to detect biothreat agents. Perhaps more importantly, it enables identification of unexpected pathogens within the biothreat clusters that might be used in a biological attack. Second, the genetic targets for amplification in the biothreat assay are universally conserved, essential to microbial life. This lowers the risk of failed detections because these targets cannot be dispensed with by the microbe and would be difficult to modify by engineering to avoid detection. Third, the comprehensive nature of the biothreat assay enables very broad surveillance of the potential biothreat landscape, including the detection of the virulence plasmids where appropriate. Fourth, the PCR/ESI-MS instrumentation enables very high-throughput sample analysis; the theoretical maximum throughput of the biothreat assay on a current-generation PLEX-ID instrument is approximately 180 specimens over 24 hours.",

Specimens analyzed by the primer pairs that comprise the F. tularensis biothreat cluster component of the biothreat assay were used to analyze the air specimens.

The multiplexed assay was tested with environmental air from Biowatch filters. Feasibility studies were performed at 1000 GE of each target organism spiked into background matrix. The environmental background did not inhibit the ability of PLEX-ID to correctly detect the target organisms. Additional studies were conducted to demonstrate the analytical performance of the assay. These included sensitivity, specificity, linearity, and breadth of coverage of the biothreat clusters. Analytical sensitivity of the target organisms varied between 40-1000 GE/well with no false positive detections, and false negative rates below 5% for most organisms tested. The matrix that was used as background had high loads of environmental bacterial signatures (data not shown), including alphaproteobacteria such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. These might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. Breadth of coverage and specificity for detection of biothreat agents were determined with Critical Reagents Program (CRP; http://www. jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/Default.aspx?pg = 1205) reagents. There was an excellent correlation between PLEX-ID identifications and the identity of the spiked strains. Presence of two-to five-fold excess of a near-neighbor organism did not interfere with the detection of the biothreat agent. PLEX-ID assays in general are semi-quantitative at best and have a limited dynamic range for reporting genome levels of detected organisms [4] . The levels of organisms determined using the biothreat assay indicate the approximate genome equivalents/well for the target organism based on relative amplification compared to the calibrant. At higher target organism concentrations, the calibrant is often outcompeted in the PCR reaction, therefore the reported levels at the higher loads were inaccurate. This, however, does not interfere with the ability of the assay to detect the threat agent. In contrast, a specific RT-PCR assay targeting a single organism might be able to provide a measurement over a much larger linear range. In summary, the PLEX-ID Biothreat Assay kit was evaluated for detection of biothreat agents in environmental air samples. The data presented demonstrate the capability of the PCR/ESI-MS method to accurately detect and identify organisms from ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters. The assay discriminated between target agent and near neighbors with high specificity and sensitivity. The method accurately reported each organism with which it was challenged and accurately identified threat species as a threat; species and/or strains that are not considered a threat were not reported as such. The assay is capable of simultaneous detection of most NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens and HHS/USDA select agents and thus provides a means for comprehensive coverage using a high-throughput assay. The validation data support use of the Ibis PLEX-ID and the biothreat assay for detection of biological warfare agents in complex environmental matrices. Additional testing of this assay with an EU validation panel is described in a companion manuscript (Grunow et al. [49] ).",

The internal controls were designed to be identical to the expected target priming regions with the exception of five-base pair deletions to enable the control to be distinguished from the target-derived amplicon. PCR was performed in a 50 mL reaction volume containing 5 mL nucleic acid extract in a reaction mix as previously described [48] . The plate was heat-sealed with foil on a Thermo Scientific ALPS microplate heat sealer (Rockford, IL). Each sealed plate was loaded onto a Mastercycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) and PCR-amplified under the following conditions: 95uC for 10 min; then 8 cycles of 95uC for 30 s, 48uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s; then 37 cycles of 95uC for 15 s, 56uC for 20 s, and 72uC for 20 s; followed by 72uC for 2 min, and 99uC for 20 min. One-step RT-PCR was performed in wells with primers designed for viral detection. Since all reactions for a sample were run in the same 96-well plate RT-PCR cycling conditions were used for both the RT-PCR and PCR reactions as previously described [12] .",

Mass spectrometry was performed on a PLEX-ID biosensor (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). After PCR amplification, 30 mL aliquots of each PCR reaction were desalted and analyzed by mass spectrometry as previously described [2, 4] . Briefly, the PLEX-ID platform is capable of analyzing nearly 3000 PCR reactions in 24 hours and integrates a novel sample purification scheme with a high throughput fluidics/robotics platform. The PLEX-ID instrument is comprised of an input plate stacker which accommodates fifteen 96-well microtiter plates, an automated purification module which desalts and purifies amplicons with a magnetic-bead-based weak anion exchange method, and an autosampler coupled to a novel dual electrospray head which injects analytes into a Perkin Elmer ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. The platform analyzes one PCR reaction every 30 seconds in a fully automated modality. The PLEX-ID platform utilizes a novel carousel-based design for the rapid and efficient purification of PCR amplicons. The carousel is comprised of 22 identical spin cuvette modules in which the analyte solution is purified prior to ESI-MS analysis. Every 30 seconds the carousel rotates by one position facilitating the aspiration/or dispensation of the requisite reagents.",

            "text": "Data analysis and results reporting was performed in an automated fashion using on-board computer on the Ibis PLEX-ID system. For this assay, a customized reporting rule set was designed that allowed rapid and accurate detection of the biothreat targets. The biothreat assay report has 21 primer groups or threat clusters as shown in Figure S2 . These groups consist of primer pairs used to identify the target biothreat organisms. Each of the threat clusters is treated independently and the results are reported for each cluster separately. Thus, the presence or absence of each of the target biothreat clusters is directly reported. Mixed detections of two or more threats or a threat with an unrelated near neighbor in another group are also reported. Further, two additional metrics (Q-score and level) are provided in the report to assess the quality of the reported detection. The Q-Score is a rating between 0 (low) and 1 (high) of the confidence in the identification of the organism. The Q-Score is based on a number of different parameters such as, the multi-primer joint log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how well the hypothesized organisms as a group represent the observed data; the multiprimer single log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how significant the contribution of a single organism is to the solution; the fraction of missed detections, which represents the percentage of primers for a detected organism that should have produced known base count compositions, but did not; and, finally, the fraction of no data, which indicates the percentage of primers for a detected organism for which no known data exists within the PLEX-ID system. For the biothreat assay described here, a Qscore $0.85 is considered a reportable result. The level is an indication of the amount of the amplicon present in the sample reported as genome equivalents/well. This is calculated with reference to the internal calibrant as described previously [4] . The normal range for reporting these levels is between 0.16 and 106 the levels of internal controls in the assay, which in the case of the PLEX-ID Biothreat assay represents a working range of ,10 GE/ well to 1000 GE/well. In addition to the summary style report shown in Figure S2 , the system is capable of reporting organism/strain level matches based on the genomic sequence data in the PLEX-ID database ( Figure S3 ). This is provided as a research utility tool in a separate analysis workstation. Additional details for each of the matches, including the detected base compositions and levels, are available using this report. Figure S1 Biothreat assay plate layout. Left panel: Sample wells and target biothreat cluster for each primer pair are indicated. Each well contains two or three multiplexed primer pairs. Letters A through H represent 8 rows of a 96-well plate, whereas numbers 1 through 12 represent the columns. Each sample is analyzed in 16 PCR reaction wells and six samples can be tested per PCR plate. Details of the primer pairs are given in Table 1 . Right panel: The 96-well PCR plate layout. Each PCR well includes a synthetic nucleic acid template that serves as a calibrant. In multiplexed wells, this calibrant provides an amplicon similar to the amplicon expected for the organism shown in red. (DOCX) Figure S2 Example of PLEX-ID summary report. Each biothreat cluster is listed separately. Detection of an organism within a cluster is listed at the species level. If no organism within the cluster is detected, the cluster is marked as ''Not Detected''. ",
