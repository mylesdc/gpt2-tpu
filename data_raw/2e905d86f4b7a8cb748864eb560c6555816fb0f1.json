            "text": "We conducted an unbiased metagenomics survey using plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and patients without liver disease (control). RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.",

These procedures led to the identification of the viruses causing hepatitis A and B [1, 2] , acquired immune deficiency syndrome [3] , and acute respiratory syndrome [4] . Classical microbiology and molecular biology methods also led to the somewhat serendipitous discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus [5] , a member of the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) that has been proposed to constitute a fourth domain of life [6] . In contrast, the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) required a more targeted approach employing screening of bacteriophage display libraries with immune serum, thus heralding a new era of virus discovery [7] . More recently, an unbiased approach has been used to identify viruses by DNAse treatment of serum, followed by amplification and sequencing of the nucleic acids protected in virions [8] . Using this method, not only was hepatitis B virus (HBV) identified in the serum of an infant with acute hepatitis B, but so too were two species of bovine parvoviruses, possibly because bovine serum was used to dilute the experimental samples [8] .",

For instance, a metagenomic survey of the microflora of hives and royal jelly led to the identification of Israeli acute paralysis virus in honeybee colonies exhibiting collapse disorder [10] . A similar approach was used to study the etiology of a human disease by sequencing cDNA from a Merkel cell cancer, where a viral transcript corresponding to a novel polyomavirus was identified and referred to as the Merkel cell polyomavirus [11] . A metagenomic survey was also employed to examine infected tissues from three patients that had received liver or kidney transplantation from the same donor [12] . BLASTx alignments of 94,000 sequences yielded 14 hits that shared high similarity to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The infectivity of the virus was subsequently confirmed combining cell culture, electron microscopy, and immunochemical assays [12] . Additional contributions of metagenomics to clinical virology include the identification of a bunyavirus in patients with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome [13] . Characterizations of the human gut virome have revealed the diversity and predominance of bacteriophages in this environment [14, 15] . Recently, NGS was employed to determine the complexity of the human virome in febrile children with acute diarrhea [16, 17] . In addition, novel viruses from human and animal samples have been discovered, although their pathogenicity remains to be ascertained in most cases [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

In most cases where a relatively high density of viral sequences was found, there was a single predominant virus (Supplemental Tables S15-S28). For instance, in all libraries with more than 100,000 viral sequences, a single virus and its quasispecies accounted for more than 75% of viral sequence abundance ( Figure 2 ; bar graphs). It is notable that DNA viruses were detected in RNA as well as DNA libraries, such as HBV and Torque teno virus (TTV). However, it is unknown whether this finding represents the detection of viral transcripts or the inability to eradicate DNA in the RNA libraries. The relative abundance of HBV-and TTV-like sequences in RNA libraries compared to DNA libraries was 0.20% and 0.13%, respectively (HBV in sample hbvP02:30 vs 14,786 read ends/million; TTV in sample nshP01:22 vs 16,483 read ends/million). To a lesser extent (about one read per million), we also detected sequences resembling RNA viruses in our DNA libraries (Supplemental Tables S15-S28 ). This may represent alignment inaccuracies or stretches of unknown DNA viruses that resemble RNA viruses. Retroviruses constitute a special case, as they are RNA viruses that retro-transcribe into DNA, and integrate into human chromosomes.

These data suggest that most of the reads that could not be classified during alignments with BLASTn belong to unknown bacteria. More specifically, 11% to 55% of scaffolds aligned to bacterial proteins. Nonetheless, the vast majority of scaffolds (44% to 85%) did not resemble any protein in the 'nr' database, which likely reflects proteins that have not yet been discovered. Assembly of viral sequences was also possible for all viruses shown in Figure 2 as the most abundant virus in each library (data not shown).",

The most conspicuous were scaffolds that encoded polypeptides resembling proteins found in viruses with circular genomes and in nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). During BLASTx alignments, scaffolds from several libraries ranging in size from 600 to 2100 nt hit the replicase sequences from various circoviruses. The most striking example was Scaffold2603 in library aihP01D ( Figure 5A ), which was ,2100 nt long. After refining its sequence with GapCloser for SOAPdenovo, we found that the sequence encoded a polypeptide sharing ,65% identity with the replicase of a Bat circovirus (BtCV; AEL87784.1; BLASTx alignments E-value 7.6e-75; 95% coverage) that was recently identified in China [35] . We then reassessed Scaffold2603 and found that it encoded an additional protein with weak similarity to a putative protein from the Circovirus-like genome RW-E [25] . Interestingly, we also assembled scaffolds resembling circoviruses in library nshP01D and, at lower frequency, in library norP01D. When the 582 original read ends from Scaffold2603 were aligned by BLASTn to the genomes of BtCV or RW-E, the two closest relatives, only a small proportion showed any similarity to the circovirus genomes ( Figure 5A ), supporting the genetic plasticity previously reported for this genus of viruses [25, 35, 36] . Cloning and sequencing of PCR fragments amplified from sample aihP01 verified the existence of sequences assembled into Scaffold2603. The replicase-like amino acid sequence encoded by Scaffold2603 was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of circoviral replicases and the novel protein sequence formed a separated branch with the two related circoviruses, but was divergent from the rest of the circovirus replicases ( Figure 5B ).",

Schematic of bioinformatics pipeline used for processing of NGS libraries. High quality reads, excluding ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences, were aligned against the taxonomy databases of NCBI using BLASTn (taxonomic classification). Unclassified or ambiguously classified reads, together with virus, phage, and HERV sequences were assembled into scaffolds. Scaffolds were used to query the non-redundant protein database of NCBI using BLASTx to identify viral proteins with similarity to predicted polypeptides in our scaffolds (finding novel viruses). Given the large genomes of NCLDVs, hits to this class of viruses were reanalyzed with the profile hidden Markov model-based algorithm HHblits. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the presence of novel viral-like sequences in our samples. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060595.g001 of higher eukaryotes [37] . NCLDV include the families Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Iridoviridae and Mimiviridae [38] . We found hits to NCLDV in all libraries included in this report (Figure 3 and Supplemental Tables S29-S42). Although five conserved ortholog gene clusters have been identified within the genomes of all NCLDV [39] , none of these were found in our bioinformatics analyses. Given that phycodnaviruses and mimiviruses (hereafter referred to as large viruses) have not been reported to infect humans, we re-evaluated a portion of the large virus BLASTx top hits using the HHblits algorithm [32] and the SwissProt20 database. When BLASTx and HHblits results were compared, it was observed that both algorithms aligned remarkably similar fragments of the query sequences in the corresponding top hits ( Figure S1 ). Nonetheless, 19 out of 44 cases reported by BLASTx as large viruses proteins were re-classified as proteins from other taxa by HHblits, mainly bacterial proteins; 18 instances produced identical results (i.e. both algorithms reported the same target protein as top hit); and seven corresponded to other large viruses proteins (Supplemental Table S43 ). However, all were partial alignments ranging from 36 to 232 amino acids, not the entire target protein. Such divergent results are a cautionary note on the intrinsic difficulty of identifying NCLDV proteins from partial alignments. It is not possible to conclude that such sequences represent bona fide large viruses proteins until further experimental evidence is gathered.",

We assembled scaffolds with nucleotide sequences unrelated to all viruses reported in the databases; these sequences encoded polypeptides with similarity to previously identified viral proteins, which is consistent with the identification of novel viral agents. In libraries that contained abundant viral hits, a predominant virus was found, which usually coincided with the clinical diagnosis, such as chronic HBV and HCV infection. The exception was sample hcvP02, where the predominant species was GBV-C, another flavivirus found to replicate in primary T and B lymphocytes [40] . So far, no pathogenic properties have been attributed to GBV-C [40, 41] . Indeed, it has been suggested that GBV-C co-infection reduces the severity of HIV infection by mechanisms that remain poorly understood [40] [41] [42] [43] . Although we found that one patient initially diagnosed with HCV harbored high levels of GBV-C but only small traces of HCV in plasma, it should be noted that GBV-C abundance is higher in blood than in liver while the opposite is true for HCV [42] .",

However, some have speculated that AIH may be triggered by viruses [44] while others have suggested that fat may accumulate in the liver in response to virus infection [45] . Accordingly, there may be some interest in further defining the virome in plasma from these patients. The sample from patients diagnosed with AIH harbored abundant TTV and GBV-C. TTV was even more abundant in plasma from the NASH patient, but absent in patients with hepatitis B or C. Originally, TTV was isolated from a Japanese patient suffering from cryptogenic hepatitis [46] , and subsequently found in serum from patients with hepatitis lacking diagnostic markers for viral infection [47] . As with GBV-C, no pathogenicity has been ascribed to TTV [34] ; however, it was proposed that TTV may play an indirect role on carcinogenesis by modulating T cells immunological responses [48] . Also, increased TTV burden has been found in the plasma from immunocompromised subjects [49, 50] . Several other disorders have also been linked to anelloviruses [51, 52] , but a proof for their role in pathogenesis is still lacking. Nevertheless, TTV seems to reunite many of the idealized attributes of a well-adapted virus, including persistence, high levels of replication, prevalence in the population, and high transmissibility [53] .",

Members in the family Circoviridae are ubiquitous, highly diverse and induce immuno-suppression in birds; at least one contributes to the development of postweaning multisystem wasting syndrome in pigs. However, no pathogenicity has been demonstrated in humans, although they are often found in human feces and plasma [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 36, 54] . Although we found circovirus sequences in patients with NASH and AIH, their presence does not imply any linkage with liver diseases, and indeed they were also found in our control libraries.",

This method is reliable for identical or highly similar sequences but has two obvious limitations. First, viruses with novel sequences may not be detected. Second, sequences found in taxonomically divergent species may trigger spurious hits that are difficult to resolve by computational methods. In this regard, a group of viruses that deserve special attention are NCLDV that include mimiviruses and phycodnaviruses [26] . The first of the so-called giant viruses reported was Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus; more recently, Giant marseillevirus, Cafeteria roenbergensis virus and Megavirus chilensis were isolated [26, [55] [56] [57] . The genomes of those viruses may extend up to ,1.2 Mb and their gene complements can be as large as 1000, which by far exceeds the number of protein coding genes in many bacteria [26] . However, these large viruses have not been reported in human samples and, based on our results, we are not prepared to say that we have seen them in our samples either.",

The incorporation of a viral preparation step increased the ratio of virus to human sequences (1:229) by nearly two log-fold in comparison to a recent metagenomic study of febrile and afebrile children's nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples, where approximately 1:16,000 viral to human sequences were reported [16] . We also recovered viruses at high coverage that were previously diagnosed by traditional serological methods, while unsuspected viruses were detected in several other samples at high density. Finally, we defined a minimal threshold of abundance of viral read ends, Figure 2 . Viral read ends represent only a small fraction of libraries from plasma. Pie charts: Classification of reads from each library into human, bacteria, virus, and unknown categories (HERV and phage sequences are not included as they were found at low frequency, not visible at the scale of the pie charts). The number of clean reads (high-quality sequences excluding ribosomal, mitochondrial, and low complexity sequences; in black), ambiguous reads (in brackets), viral reads (in red), and the density of viral reads per million (in blue) are indicated. Bar graphs: Red bars depict total number of viral reads (normalized to 100%) and green bars represent the percentage thereof that corresponds to the most abundant virus in each library (N.I. not identified; indicates that no predominant virus was identified during BLASTn alignments). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060595.g002 which suffices to detect viruses present at low levels. Namely, HCV was detected in patients affected by NASH disease, at a density of approximately seven read ends per million. To make a clinical diagnosis of NASH, other liver disease agents such as HCV should be excluded and the diagnosis of NASH was therefore erroneous in the one case where HCV was detected in the metagenomics library and confirmed by PCR.",
