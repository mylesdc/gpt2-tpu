However, it remains unclear if APN-null neonatal pigs are protected from TGEV. Here we report the generation of APN-null pigs by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. APN-null pigs are produced with normal pregnancy rate and viability, indicating lack of APN is not embryonic lethal. After viral challenge, APN-null neonatal piglets are resistant to highly virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Histopathological analyses indicate APN-null pigs exhibit normal small intestine villi, while wildtype pigs show typical lesions in small intestines. Immunochemistry analyses confirm that no transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen is detected in target tissues in APN-null piglets. However, upon porcine epidemic diarrhea virus challenge, APNnull pigs are still susceptible with 100% mortality. Collectively, this report provides a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to TGEV and clarifies that APN is dispensable for the PEDV infection in pigs.",

Since 2010, greater economic losses have been made due to the outbreak of emerging and reemerging CoVs, including variant strains of PEDV 2 , porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 3-5 .",

For example, CD163 has been identified as an entry receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus and subsequent studies demonstrated that CD163-null pigs are immune to PRRS, which presents a valuable resource for breeding PRRS-resistant pigs 7 . Aminopeptidase-N (APN) is widely present in the membrane of the epithelial cells of the small intestine in a variety of species, including pigs. In addition, it has been shown to be involved in multiple functions, including peptide metabolism, cell adhesion and cholesterol uptake 8 . Curiously, APN has also been suggested as a receptor for multiple alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV 9 , PDCoV 10,11 , and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) 12,13 . However, these reports relied on the use of cell line or other in vitro models, raising the concern regarding the biological significance of APN's role in vivo. Meanwhile, whether APN is also required for PEDV infection is unresolved. Previous studies regarding of the role of APN in PEDV susceptibility have yielded conflicting results [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . To resolve unambiguously the functional requirement for porcine APN in TGEV and PEDV infection in vivo, APN-null pigs have to be produced and viral challenge assay performed. Recently, Whitworth et al. have reported APN-null post-weaning pigs are resistant to TGEV but not PEDV 20 . However, TGEV and PEDV primarily affect suckling piglets with up to 100% mortality and post-weaning pigs have been shown to be less susceptible to these viruses 21 . We believe it is more biological relevant to determine if APN-null neonatal piglets (<10 days) are resistant to TGEV and PEDV. Meanwhile, only 1 APN-null piglet was used for PEDV challenge experiment in Whitworth et al. study, further consolidating the necessity to clarify the role of APN in PEDV infection again.",

Initial attempts to produce APN-null pigs have been inefficient with only 2 viable piglets out of 6 embryo transfers (150 embryos/transfer), which may due to the inherent limitation of the particular donor cell line used. To overcome the limitation, a pool of transfected cells or fibroblast cell lines established from the APN-null pig were used as donors for subsequent SCNT experiments. Results showed a normal early embryogenesis with above 40% of constructed APN-null embryos developing into blastocyst stage after being cultured for 6 days in vitro (Table S1 ). A total of 1,866 SCNT embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 10 surrogate sows in two days with one week apart. We detected a pregnancy rate of 70% (d50) and all these pregnancies went to term (Table S2) . Twenty-one female piglets were born by natural delivery from seven litters with normal SCNT efficiency (1.13%) and the representative piglets are shown in Fig. 1C . Litter size ranged from two to four. Eight piglets failed to thrive within 2 days after birth because of low birth weight, which was associated with the SCNT. All the remaining piglets are healthy prior to viral challenge. Genotyping of small intestines revealed that all the SCNT piglets exhibited bi-allelic modifications at the genomic DNA level (Fig. 1D represents K1-K5 and Table S3 are sequencing results of all cloned piglets used in the present study) and predicted to be translational knockout (KO) (APN \u2212/\u2212 ). Furthermore, APN KO was confirmed by quantitating protein expression (Fig. 1E ) in small intestine in the APN-null piglets. Taken together, these data suggest APN is dispensable for embryogenesis and fetal development in pigs. This conclusion maybe not surprising given that APN-null mice also develop normally without physiological changes 23 .",

To resolve the paradox on the requirement of APN in PEDV infection, APN-null piglets were challenged with PEDV, which caused huge economic loss globally in recent years. All WT (n = 10) and APN-null (n = 7) piglets displayed lethargy and severe watery diarrhea by 24 hpi and died by 84 hpi. Meanwhile, the onset of these clinical signs was accompanied with the detection of PEDV in fecal samples between 24-72 hpi as determined by qPCR (Fig. 4C ) and ELISA (Fig. S2D) .",

Moreover, APN knockout in mice results in \"no gross or histological abnormalities\" while \"standard neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, locomotor, and hematological studies revealed no alterations\" 23 . Structural analyses have suggested that the recognition sites for CoV are located on the exposed outer surface of APN and CoV binding does not interfere with other functions of APN 8 . Future work should be directed toward modifying only the critical binding site of APN with CoVs while maintaining other biological functions of APN. One such example is the production of CD163 modified pigs, for which only the exon responsible for PRRSV recognition is disrupted.

However, given we have completed this work independently, there are at least three major differences between our studies. First, only 1 APN knockout pig was used for PEDV challenge experiment in Whitworth's study compared to 7 in our study. Second, we performed viral challenge experiment in colostrum-deprived neonatal piglets instead of post-weaning piglets used in Whitworth's study. Since TGEV and PEDV primarily affect suckling piglets with up to 100% mortality and post-weaning pigs have been shown to be less susceptible to these viruses and often survive 21 , we believe the animal model we used is more biological relevant. Third, a CRISPR/Cas9 double nicking nuclease (Cas9n) editing system was used to disrupt porcine APN in the present study given the reduced off-target activity of Cas9n 28 compared with Cas9 in Whitworth's study.",

Fresh small intestinal (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) tissues were excised and fixed in 4% PFA and dehydrated overnight in 70% ethanol. The fixed specimens were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 \u03bcm-thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using a standard protocol. The distribution of TGEV and PEDV antigen was determined by immunohistochemistry with a TGEV and PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody, which was produced in our laboratory using the antigen retrieval method described previously 32 . Samples were observed by conventional light microscopy. Statistical analysis. The statistical data were analyzed from at least three biological replicates. Results are stated as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Differences between two groups were determined by Student's t tests.",
