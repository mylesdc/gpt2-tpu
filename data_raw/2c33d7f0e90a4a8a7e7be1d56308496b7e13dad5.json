The combined use of antihistamines and decongestants may alleviate symptoms in adults, but results are heterogeneous [15, 17] . Another meta-analysis investigated the use of nasal decongestants in the common cold in 286 adults, and found no benefit for the relief of nasal congestion [15, 18] .

The evaluation of rescue paracetamol use as a dichotomous variable showed that 50.7% of patients in the placebo group versus 25% in the treatment group used the rescue medication. This difference indicates that for every four patients treated with the study drug, one did not take rescue paracetamol (NNT = 4). This reduction of the rate of rescue medication use is an index of analgesic efficacy and demonstrates that patients with flulike symptoms actually seek an alternative form of relief when the medication they are taking is not efficacious. Time to freedom from symptoms was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.",

The rapid symptom reduction precludes demonstration of any between-group differences at the end of the treatment (48 to 72 hours). Therefore, the fact that treatment group had a statistically significant difference from the placebo group at this time point supports the efficacy of the study drug.",

This difference of up to 3 points in symptom scores was constant during the first 13 doses and translates into a trend towards a 1.5-day reduction in the total duration of symptoms. If confirmed in larger studies, this finding could have a major impact on the population, given the high annual incidence of flu-like syndrome and the large number of users of over-the-counter medication for symptomatic relief of its symptoms worldwide. After the 13th dose, symptom scores were very low and similar between groups, which confirms the self-limiting characteristic of the disease and made it difficult for patients to assign scores to their symptoms. According to the study protocol, patients did not have to take the medication (either active or placebo) for more than 10 doses (corresponding to 48 hours, or 2 days). This explains the reduction in the number of cases for analysis after the 13th dose.",

A small between-group difference in this variable was already detectable at baseline. Although not significant, patients in the treatment group had higher baseline mean values (a 4.44 mmHg difference), which may be attributable to randomization. However, all mean values in both groups were within normal limits both at baseline and after treatment. The increase in mean systolic BP attributable to treatment with the active formulation was only 1.6 mmHg; therefore, there was no increase in sensitivity to sympathomimetic agents, and the response after treatment in this group was not more intense than in the placebo group. The absence of patient-or investigatordetected effects on cardiovascular parameters, HR, or SBP suggests that the study drug did not increase cardiovascular risk. Hence, this RCT adds valuable safety data, particularly in regard to the effects of the decongestant agent phenylephrine on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters.",

The majority of patients were symptom-free by the 7th day after the end of treatment. Moreover, most patients had a low symptom score at randomization, probably because of the generally accepted concept of at-home recovery for flu-like illness. This limitation had a negative influence on identification of severe disease, which, combined with the rapid resolution of symptoms (very low symptom score), reduces the possibility of identifying between-group differences. For these reasons, any statistically significant differences found might be interpreted as having potential for clinical relevance.",
