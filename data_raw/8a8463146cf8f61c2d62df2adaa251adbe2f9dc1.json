            "text": "In France as in other countries, influenza surveillance systems are mainly based on data collected from physicians who report cases matching the case definition. Data given by these sentinel networks allow detection of the start and end of influenza epidemics. However, the results of this surveillance do not allow the identification of the true burden of illness caused by influenza in the community because they are restricted to consulting cases. Data from the literature indicate that up to 60% of individuals with influenza do not visit physician and this proportion differs between countries, reflecting differences in the healthcare systems and socio-cultural differences in healthcare seeking behaviours [1] . Moreover this proportion can vary from one season to the next depending on the circulating strain [1] [2] [3] . On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic due to the novel A(H1N1)2009 influenza virus [4] . During a pandemic, the changes in healthcare utilisation in comparison with seasonal influenza epidemics are unpredictable. Because of the anxiety in the population or the overflow of healthcare services, for instance, data produced by sentinel networks could induce an over or an underestimation of the true burden of influenza. As part as an ongoing community study on the burden of seasonal influenza, the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) conducted a national population based study between May 2009 and April 2010, in order to estimate the incidence and the burden of self-defined influenza, and to describe healthcare seeking behaviour for influenza during the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic in the French population.",

The case definition of ILI in this network is the sudden appearance of fever and myalgia associated with respiratory symptoms. Except for the suddenness, we used an identical symptom based case definition in order to compare the estimations of our study with the estimations from this network. Because of the difficulty for children of reporting myalgia, we considered that children younger than 15 years had ILI if they reported respiratory symptoms associated with fever or myalgia. Estimates of medical consultations for ILI take into account the estimate of French population (Insee, 2009).",

Symptoms reported by the self-defined flu cases in our study were compared with those of virological confirmed A(H1N1)2009 cases [8, 9] . The most frequently reported symptoms such as fever and cough were very similar (86% and 92% for fever \u2265 38\u00b0C, 86% and 88% for cough). Almost nine out of ten cases used medication that was mostly bought after prescription. In a national prospective survey of household contacts carried out in France during a seasonal influenza epidemic (year 2000), the proportion of ILI cases visiting a physician was estimated at 57%, the mean number of consultations was 1.3 (\u00b1 0.6), and the proportion of medication obtained with a prescription was estimated at 90% [2] . Although the study designs of the surveys were different, the healthcare seeking behaviour for influenza observed in the context of pandemic influenza season was not significantly higher that of a \"classical\" seasonal influenza in France. The proportion of cases that consulted in our study was similar to Belgium (67%), but higher than the proportion observed in the Netherlands (25%) and in Portugal (45%) during a seasonal influenza due to A (H3N2) virus [1] or in England during the A(H1N1)2009 epidemic (decrease from 43% to 32%) [7] .

On the one hand, an underestimation of the incidence and severity of the disease can not be excluded, because the most affected household members could have been unable to answer the telephone. On the other hand, we collected self-defined flu cases without biological or even practitioner's confirmation, and therefore other pathogens may have induced flu-like illnesses.

These recommendations have been widely disseminated in the whole population through television, flyers and internet during the entire study period [10] . These messages seem to have an impact, as more than one third of the population reported that they washed their hands more often this season than during the previous season because of the recommendations that have been made to prevent A(H1N1)2009 transmission (interviews from January to April 2010). A similar increase in handwashing has been observed in other countries in relation to A(H1N1)2009 pandemic, in Hong Kong (30.3%) and England (28.1%) [11, 12] .

These data suggest that people who felt more concerned about the pandemic were the most able to get vaccinated and to follow the hygiene recommendations.

Other studies also concluded that women are more likely to improve handwashing to prevent the transmission of respiratory disease [11, 12, 17] .
