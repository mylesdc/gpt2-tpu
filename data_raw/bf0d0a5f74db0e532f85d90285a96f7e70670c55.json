            "text": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification (SUMOylation) is an important and widely used reversible modification system in eukaryotic cells. It regulates various cell processes, including protein targeting, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell division. To understand its role in the model lepidoptera insect Bombyx mori, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed to express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-SUMO fusion protein along with ubiquitin carrier protein 9 of Bombyx mori (BmUBC9). SUMOylation substrates from Bombyx mori cells infected with this baculovirus were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins were identified, of which 59 proteins were functionally categorized to gene ontology (GO) terms. Analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that 46 of the identified proteins were involved in 76 pathways that mainly play a role in metabolism, spliceosome and ribosome functions, and in RNA transport. Furthermore, SUMOylation of four candidates (polyubiquitin-C-like isoform X1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cyclin-related protein FAM58A-like and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran) were verified by co-immunoprecipitation in Drosophila schneide 2 cells. In addition, 74% of the identified proteins were predicted OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15 22012 to have at least one SUMOylation site. The data presented here shed light on the crucial process of protein SUMOylation in Bombyx mori.",

PTMs are essential for a variety of cellular processes and provide an important type of post-translational regulation. A large number of PTMs such as phosphorylation [1], methylation [2], acetylation [3], and glycosylation [4] are known and they regulate various Biol. processes such as transcriptional regulation [5] and protein degradation [6] . Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification (SUMOylation), another type of PTM, is structurally related to ubiquitin. The 3-D structure of the human small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) protein is very similar to that of ubiquitin and in several instances SUMO competes with ubiquitin for a given lysine acceptor site, thereby preventing its subsequent poly-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome [7, 8] . SUMO is believed to play roles in various cellular processes, including protein interaction, subcellular localization, and transcriptional regulation [9,10].",

It is noteworthy that SUMOylation is also a dynamic progress. The SUMO protein can be cleaved from the substrates by the same proteases that process the SUMO precursor. Indeed, it has been reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation is critical for the normal growth of cells [16, 17] .",

To investigate the subcellular localization of SUMO in BmN cells, immunofluorescence analysis was carried out using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Although fluorescence was observed across the entire cell, it was mainly observed in the cytoplasm and appeared as aggregated dots in the nucleus (Figure 1 ). The latter observation was in accordance with that of a previous study that found that many SUMOylated proteins are located in the nucleus [22] . Additionally, SUMO is found to be enriched in the nuclei of cultured Drosophila S2 and pole cells, and repression of SUMOylation alters its distribution into the cytoplasm [23, 24] . In the control set, no fluorescence was detected ( Figure 1 ). As a control, pre-immune serum was used as the primary antibody. The nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI).

BmN cells were infected with the recombinant virus. The SUMOylated proteins were isolated with anti-GFP microbeads. After elution with the supplied elution buffer, the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody. The control was prepared by using the vector expressing eGFP only, and an identical isolation process was performed in parallel. As shown in Figure 2 , only the band of eGFP was observed in the control set, while a number of distinct bands, besides that of the 37-kDa eGFP-BmSUMO fusion protein, were observed in the eluate from cells infected with eGFP-SUMO and BmUBC9-expressing recombinant virus. This observation strongly indicated that several SUMOylated candidates had been successfully isolated.",

It should be noted that the control eGFP and eGFP-SUMO preparations have some overlapping proteins, which may have been observed owing to nonspecific interactions. In addition, some proteins were found to be unique to the control sample and may have been purified owing to the complexity of the sample preparation as well as the limited sequencing time in the mass spectrometer [25] .

However, identifying new SUMO targets and understanding the functions of protein SUMOylation has been largely limited by the low level of SUMOylation. It has been reported that the SUMO-UBC9 fusion protein has a higher conjugating activity for SIM-containing targets such as Sp100 and human cytomegalovirus immediate-early 2 (IE2) protein [26] . Hence, we used a special baculovirus vector, which can express foreign proteins under different promoters, to express eGFP-SUMO and BmUBC9. The control construct that could express eGFP-SUMO, but lacked BmUBC9, was also used for immunoprecipition ( Figure 2, lane 3) . The data presented here show that compared to eGFP-SUMO, eGFP-SUMO and BmUBC9 bound to a much larger number of diverse cellular proteins and interacted with some SIM-containing proteins with higher affinities. Thus, the results confirmed that the SUMO-UBC9 fusion construct could be useful for identifying or purifying SUMO-modified proteins and for modulating the cellular SUMO pathway. However, it should be noted that over-expression of both SUMO and Ubc9 may lead to the pull-down of contaminants, non-relevant SUMO targets or proteins interacting non-covalently with SUMO (but not SUMOylated themselves). Of the 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins, some may not be truly modified by SUMOylation in vivo. Additional experiments such as immunoblotting and/or SUMOylation site identifications should be performed to confirm the status and dynamics of SUMOylation of each individual target.",

On comparing the potential substrates of silkworm with the yeast data [25] , some homologs such as budding proteins (Buds), transcriptional activator Gcns Uba2, and transcript elongation factors (Spts) were identified. In this study, all the components of the multiprotein complex involved in SUMOylation, including SAE1, SAE2, and PIAS, were found to coimmunoprecipitate in the presence of eGFP-BmSUMO and BmUBC9. Furthermore, BmUBC9 and BmSUMO were identified in both eGFP and eGFP-SUMO plus BmUBC9 preparations (data not shown). Some of the homologous proteins identified in this study have been previously reported to be SUMOylated. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone calreticulin is known to be SUMOylated, and abolishing SUMOylation enhanced calreticulin expression in an X Box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) dependent manner, resulting in increased calreticulin-counteracted endoplasmic reticulum stress [31] . The human transcription factor II D (TFIID) subunits TBP-associated factors 5 (TAF5) and TAF12 are modified by SUMO-1 both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in dynamic regulation of the promoter-binding activity of TFIID [32] . The endoribonuclease Dicer, which cleaves the stem-loop structure from pre-miRNAs, allowing them to dissociate into their mature, 20-22-nucleotide single-stranded form, has also been shown to be SUMOylated [33] . Moreover, as shown in Table 1 , a number of ribosomal proteins and heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been identified as SUMOylation substrates. It is worth mentioning that several ribosomal proteins and HSPs isolated from human sperm have also been found to be SUMOylated [34] . SUMOylation of the human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) increases its stability [35] . In addition, HSP27 has been reported to be associated with the SUMOylation system [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

            "text": "In this study, recombinant baculovirus of B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) was used to express eGFP-SUMO plus BmUBC9. Baculoviridae is a family of enveloped, double-stranded DNA (81.7-178.7 kb) viruses that infect invertebrates, particularly insects of the order Lepidoptera. Numerous reports have confirmed that the viral infection is closely associated with SUMOylation [40, 41] . It is known that some viral proteins such as the chicken embryo lethal orphan (CELO) adenovirus Gam1 protein [42, 43] , the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein [44, 45] , and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) [46] can target SUMOylation enzymes, causing broad effects on host SUMO substrates. In addition, some viral proteins such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 protein [47] and the HPV E1 protein [48] can exploit the host SUMOylation mechanism because they need to be SUMO-modified in order to exert their functions. Some other viral proteins such as human herpes virus-6 (HHV6) IE1, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Zta, EBV Rta, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) P6 Gag, and the N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have all been shown to take advantage of the host SUMOylation system [5, 49, 50] . In addition, some viruses encode SUMOylation mimicking enzymes, such as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) K-bZIP protein and the adenovirus early region 1B 55-kDa protein (E1B-55K) protein, both of which possess SUMO ligase activities [51, 52] . During our investigations, several proteins from BmNPV were also identified (Table S2 ). It has been reported that infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) leads to a decrease in the amount of free SUMO, coupled with an increase in the amount of SUMO-conjugated products [53] . Further studies will focus on the additional roles that SUMOylation may be playing during baculovirus replication.",

An analysis of all the identified SUMOylation sites showed that approximately 41% (400 out of 983 sites) of them do not conform to the \u03a8KxE motif. In this regard, the current understanding of SUMOylation recognition is still inadequate [44] .

A total of 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins were identified from the B. mori proteome, of which 59 proteins were functionally categorized to GO terms. KEGG pathways analysis showed that 46 proteins were involved in 76 pathways that mainly play a role in metabolism, spliceosome and ribosome functions, and in RNA transport. In total, 74% of the identified proteins were predicted to have at least one SUMOylation site. These data shed light on the crucial process of protein SUMOylation in B. mori.",
