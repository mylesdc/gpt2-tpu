The most common methods in use, based on coalescent inference, have been widely used but not extensively tested against simulated epidemics. Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased. We illustrate this with an application to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

The coalescent is a framework that predicts distributional aspects of branch lengths in temporal phylogenetic trees in terms of a demographic parameter called the effective population size. A temporal tree is one where emergence times for internal nodes are estimated (assuming tips have known isolation dates). If the mutation rate is known (or can be estimated), then a temporal scale can be superposed on to the phylogenetic tree. As one goes back in time through the tree, lineages coalesce at points called coalescent events and there comes a time when all the lineages coalesce into a single lineage: this is the most recent common ancestor and the time to it from the present is known as the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). If the evolving organisms are not under strong selection during the time up to their TMRCA and there is no population structure, then the effective population size is expected to be approximately equal to the actual population size (in practice, it is almost always less than the actual population size).",

It can be used to estimate phylogenetic trees and apply the coalescent model to infer demographic changes from sequence data. A Bayesian approach is used: given the data (aligned sequences), a specified model structure (coalescent, substitution model, rate heterogeneity model) and specified prior distributions of parameters, the posterior distribution of trees and parameters is estimated. BEAST uses an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees and parameters. As a result of this approach, the time-varying effective population size estimated by the coalescent is averaged over many phylogenetic trees. If a non-parametric estimate based on the generalized skyline plot is implemented, then the resulting estimate is called the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP). Both piecewise constant and piecewise linear skyline models can be implemented, the latter appropriate if one knows a priori that the inferred population is growing. It is also possible to specify specific parametric models for the effective population size, such as exponential growth, which may be appropriate when analysing an emerging epidemic. We will explore both approaches here.",

However, the implication that H1N1 transmission may have temporarily been reduced around late April 2009 should be treated with caution. Samples obtained in the USA during spring 2009 will be beset with sampling biases: spatially (more samples from some areas than others, given that US states varied in the level of testing undertaken), temporally (more intensive testing was often undertaken for the first few weeks of cases in a locality, and less thereafter, and there were national changes in testing protocols) and epidemiologically linked (samples taken from individuals in the same local outbreak, and which therefore are not random independent samples from the H1N1 infected population overall). In some analyses, a few of these biases were controlled for by removing sequences collected from patients in known local epidemiological clusters [8] but in general it is not clear the extent to which such biases in sampling affect estimates.",

[16] have performed a similar exercise for seasonally fluctuating influenza epidemics, and showed how different sampling protocols can influence inferred transmission dynamics in BSPs. In the case of seasonal epidemics, they point out the importance of temporal sampling, especially where populations undergo bottlenecks and the number of lineages are substantially reduced from one season to the next. BSPs inferred from samples taken after a bottleneck are unable to recover transmission dynamics prior to the bottleneck. Their analysis indicates that single-generation sampling or sampling randomly about a target generation as the epidemic begins to slow down is the most effective strategy. Also of interest is their observation that joining together successive BSPs inferred over shorter timescales was more representative of changes in population size than a single BSP over a longer time period, which they suggest may be owing to poorly specified prior probabilities in BEAST. Certainly for longer-term population dynamics strongly influenced by selection from the immune system or vaccination, the use of coalescent methods becomes questionable. For the work presented here, we adopted a branching process model to simulate the early stages of an epidemic. The model is parametrized by the basic reproduction number, R, which determines the rate of (exponential) growth of the epidemic, a dispersion parameter, k, which quantifies heterogeneity in infectiousness between individuals, and the generation time. We incorporate a realistic mutational model so that starting from a sequence of one of the early isolates, we simulate sequences collected over a specified number of generations of spread in the epidemic. We then compare these to assess how well coalescent methods are able to reliably estimate the true dynamics of the simulated epidemic.",

Rambaut et al. [17] find the HA gene to have mean rate of evolutionary change to be 5.72e 23 nucleotide substitutions (sub) per site per year (the highest of all the proteins, unsurprisingly, given its function in avoiding the immune system). This equals 1.57e 25 sub per site per day, which for a generation time of 2.6 days is 4.1e 25 sub per site per generation. In our simulation, we choose a mutation rate of 1.83e 24 sub per site per generation, faster than the estimate of Rambaut et al., as the substitution rate for many pathogens is expected to be faster at short time scales owing to the long-term effects of purifying selection [18] .

The black line shows the true number of infections (and simulated sequences) through time. As shown in figure 2 , the BSP gives growth rates that slow at later times. Figure 3a shows the corresponding MCC tree similarly scaled (with time increasing to the right) to the BSP. The red circles highlight the coalescent events in this tree. Going backwards in time a coalescent event marks the merging of lineages and going forwards in time it represents the creation of new lineages. The generalized skyline plot-of which the BSP is an example-groups coalescent events into time intervals which are bound by either a coalescent event or a sampling event and within which changes in effective population size are estimated. These changes are a function of the number of lineages present and the MCC tree clearly shows that the final (most recent) coalescent event coincides with the flattening of the BSP. This is clearly illustrated by looking at the LTT plot, which counts the cumulative number of LTT (figure 3b). This flattens where there are no longer any new lineages (i.e. at the time of the last coalescent event), coincident with the flattening of the BSP. The lack of genealogical information at later times is also visible in the increased size of the highest posterior density confidence intervals in the BSP over this period.",

This means that the final coalescent event will occur quite some time before the final sampling event (in figure  3a , there are 11 sampling events after the last coalescent event: gen23-gen33). From this period onwards, there are no new lineages (see LTT) and therefore no change in the effective population size is imputed. This issue (a form of left censoring in the 'backwards in time' coalescent context) represents a limitation to how far forwards in real-time the BSP can confidently be used to estimate N e .

Strictly, the skyline plot is an estimate of the harmonic mean of the effective population size over an inter-coalescent interval [5] . When the inter-coalescent periods are large, as they are in the end of the simulation, CIs on the estimate of the harmonic mean of the effective population size need not overlap with the actual value over the whole interval, and non-overlap does not represent a technical problem with the estimation. Figure 4 shows the effects on the BSP of sampling increasingly more epidemiologically linked sequences from a simulated epidemic. Here, we simulate an epidemic with R \u00bc 1.35 and k \u00bc 1 over 36 generations, with the resulting epidemic incidence curve shown in black. The purple curve (0% randomly sampled) shows the BSP inferred by sampling (one sequence per generation) from just one lineage, that is one direct descendent generation-to-generation. These closely related samples then represent an epidemiologically linked cluster and the resulting BSP is very poor at capturing the changes in the effective population size. In comparison, the green curve (100% randomly sampled) is the BSP inferred by sampling the same simulated population but this time completely randomly (once again one sequence per generation). The intermediate curves represent intermediate degrees of randomly sampled epidemiologically linked sequences. The final effective population size is proportional to the percentage of random sampling and only in the 100 per cent randomly sampled BSP is there continued growth (although small) beyond the last coalescent event (for corresponding LTT plot, see the electronic supplementary material).",

This selection step aimed to limit the impact of demographic stochasticity on incidence curves at the start of the simulated epidemic. The three resulting datasets had real-time growth rates of r % 0.05, r % 0.13 and r % 0.2, respectively. For each of these simulated datasets, sequences were randomly sampled per generation log-proportionally, and the BSPs were estimated from these sequences. This random sampling was then repeated four more times (on the same original simulated epidemics) so that five sampled sequence sets were generated for each simulation (table 3; we are not interested here in exploring between-simulation variation). We analysed these datasets with BEAST using the same non-parametric model for the growth of N e as earlier, and then estimated the growth rate by fitting an exponential curve to the portion of the BSP that showed near exponential growth (truncating the curve following the last coalescent event). The resulting non-parametric estimates of the growth rates along with CIs for the parametric estimates are shown in table 3. The same samples were also analysed using BEAST to estimate an exponential growth rate for a parametric coalescent model with assumed exponentially growing effective population size. Figure 5a and table 3 show the resulting estimates of growth rates against the true values for the growth rate for each of the sampled sets. Even after correcting for the artificial flattening of the BSP, the exponential parametric model appears to be more accurate at estimating growth rates. The larger spread in estimated growth rates for higher simulated growth rate is probably a result of the larger truncation of BSPs owing to earlier flattening of LTT corresponding plots, and the corresponding loss of information on coalescence in the phylogeny.",

This is our major justification for assuming neutrality in the work presented here --but it should be noted that such an assumption would be expected to have more dubious validity later in a pandemic, when immunity, vaccine and antiviral use influence viral evolution. Of course, the presence of selection would also limit the applicability of coalescent methods to infer population dynamics.

The interpretation of the absolute value of the estimated effective population size, N e , and what relationship this quantity has with the actual number of individuals infected is not obvious. While the effective population size is significantly less than the number of individuals infected towards the end of the simulation (this is not the case early on), this number increases with sampling density. In most studies, N e is assumed to be the ideal (Wright -Fisher) population size that gives the same coalescent rate seen in the imputed phylogeny. That N e is invariably less than the true population size is often attributed to population structure or other heterogeneity, such as in infectiousness. In addition, in this study, we quote the median posterior N e estimates, which tend to be significantly smaller than the mean. Recent studies [34] conclude that the coalescence rate is a function of the prevalence, through sampling effects, as well as the incidence, although for a short generation time disease such as influenza, the difference between these is limited (effectively just a factor of the mean generation time).

            "text": "Owing to the way in which BSPs are computed, a slowing or even flattening off at later times will often be present and can easily be misinterpreted as evidence for a slowing of epidemic spread. While this may not be a problem for computing the demographic history of many populations, it will be most significant when applied in real-time to an epidemic when the infected host population is increasing exponentially. If one knows a priori that the number infected is growing exponentially, then coalescent estimation can be improved by a parametric exponential model (as for analysing H1N1 influenza in Fraser et al. [8] ) or even by using a more detailed epidemic model [35] . Another interesting approach that has recently been proposed is to replace Kingman's coalescent by a birth -death model, which perhaps better describes the process of infectious disease transmission [36] . This method would probably have the same advantage in accuracy as the exponential growth model, and may also avoid the problems observed when the infectious population is small (or more precisely when the proportion sampled is not small). This method should be included in future simulations.",

Alternatively, the LTT graph should be inspected to estimate the time after which there are no new lineages. We suggest that any changes evident in the BSP from this time period onwards should be disregarded. This applies most strongly during the exponential growth phase of disease spread when the imprint of such growth will be reflected in longbranch lengths at later time periods in the phylogeny.",
