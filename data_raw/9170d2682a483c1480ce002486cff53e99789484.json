FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray RP) test is an emerging diagnostic method in fast detecting multiple respiratory pathogens; the methodology and clinical significance of FilmArray RP in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis were evaluated in this study. Methods. Specimens from 74 patients with CAP were analyzed and compared using FilmArray RP, traditional multiple PCR assay, bacterial (or fungal) culture, and serological detection. Results. FilmArray RP and multiplex PCR showed 100% coincidence rate in detecting coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4). There were 15 viral specimens tested as disagreement positive results. FilmArray RP had higher detection rate in detecting dual viral and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The positive bacteria (or fungi) were found in 25 specimens. Conclusions. This study demonstrated the capability of FilmArray RP for simultaneous detection of broadspectrum respiratory pathogens and potential use in facilitating better patient care.",

            "text": "Nowadays, the golden standard for CAP diagnosis is still based on the chest radiography; however, a broad range of chest radiographic changes could be induced by various agents, a single and dual bacterium/virus, or mixed pathogens coinfections. These alterations of chest radiography are only helpful in specific cases to confirm a microbial cause of pneumonia [4] . Current diagnostic methods identify a pathogen in only 30%-40% of CAP patients [5, 6] , and the frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in CAP impairs pathogendirected antimicrobial therapy [7] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has been shown to be reliable for diagnosing the pathogens, especially for those that are difficult to culture [4] . In addition, PCR method has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting multiple microorganisms and yields results faster than culture and serological methods [8] . Most importantly, the results of PCR are not affected by prior use of antibiotics. The findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia in the past has been underestimated [4] . With multiple PCR assay, detection of multiple RNA or DNA targets in a single tube has the potential for rapid identification of complicated respiratory viral pathogens [9, 10] . The conventional techniques of microbial detection have high accuracy, but they are time-and labor-intensive, with limited range of detection and can be subjective, relying very much on technical expertise for the interpretation of cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture [11] . Direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA) and immunochromatographic antigen testing, although rapid, have poor sensitivity for the detection of most viruses [12] . The serological methods also have low sensitivity. Therefore, an assay that is capable of rapid detection and accurate identification of multiple pathogens is desirable.",

            "text": "Microorganism measurement is an integral part of CAP patient management. Accurate and rapid etiological diagnosis helps prevent secondary infection, prevent the use of unnecessary antibiotics, facilitate more timely use of antiviral drugs, and shorten hospital stays [13] . In our study, even with bacterial (or fungal) culture, antibody IgM detection, multiple PCR, and FilmArray RP, there were 18/74 cases (24.32%) of CAP that could not find the pathogens. The multiplex real-time PCR can detect a broad spectrum of respiratory microorganisms promptly, which makes it possible for clinician to treat the patients with specific antimicrobial agents. However, the main limitations of PCR method include the handling of whole batch samples (at least 8 samples) for cost and labor saving, the different boxes to do extraction, the training of specialized biologist that may be the main reason of DNA/RNA extraction and amplification being easily contaminated, and results interpretation (the frequency of false positive or false negative results hinders the use of PCR in clinical practice). Thus, the PCR is not appropriate for instant point of care especially to some severe patients. Compared with multiple PCR, the measurement time of FilmArray RP needs only about 1.2 hours and there is no need to do the experiment in batch. The single test set makes it meet the requirement of clinician to decide whether the patients should be quarantined or not. For some virus, such as Flu A, rapid diagnosis may help prevent secondary OC43 + HRV RSV + HRV HRV spread, beneficial for preventing virus nosocomial transmission. In children and adults, neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0.5-2.5 days when administered within 48 h of onset of symptoms [14] . Early use of neuraminidase inhibitors reduces the development of complications such as pneumonia [15] . From these points, the FilmArray RP offers potential advantage in patient's treatment. Due to undeveloped immune system, mixed infections with two or more respiratory viruses are common in children but are not easily detected by conventional methods; hence, the biological significance of dual infections currently is not well understood [16] . It will have more clinical significance to analyze the association between age and pathogens. In our study, FilmArray RP had higher sensitivity in detecting the dual viral infection than multiple PCR. Similarly, from previous study, RSV is the predominant virus inducing severe pneumonia in the population [17] [18] [19] and is found to be the most common cause of severe respiratory disease in infants [20] . RSA and Flu A continue to be the major causative agent in dual viral infection. In this study, the detection rate of rhinoviruses was higher than for other respiratory viruses, though its role in pneumonia is still questioned [21] . The prevalence of adenovirus-associated CAP is fairly low (3/74, 4.1%), which is similar to the previous study, but this type of infection is important to recognize because it might induce severe and fatal necrotizing pneumonia (especially serotypes 3, 7, and 14) [22] . For this, PCR is substantially more sensitive for identification of adenovirus than antigen detection [23] . Due to the wide range of pathogens responsible for CAP, in moderate or severe infection, broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover should be initiated before deescalating to narrow spectrum pathogen-directed agents once a microbiological diagnosis has been made [24, 25] . The ability to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia could have very important significance in patient's management, which may help clinicians treat patients more promptly and appropriately. In hospital, it is not uncommon of mix bacterial-viral coinfections. When bacterial culture identify positive, combining viral infection is frequently ignored by clinician. On the other hand, the decision to prescribe antibiotics may be influenced by the lag of diagnosis; especially in children, empirical antibiotic therapy is almost always initiated in these patients [26] because of their immunocompromised and concerns for severe disease. In previous study, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a causative agent of community-acquired atypical pneumonia, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes acute respiratory infections and is a common cause of CAP [27] . We used serological method to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae rather than culture. To Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumonia detection, culture is highly specific but it is a complex process that has a long turnaround time, technically demanding, and offers limited sensitivity. Serology and PCR methods may provide a rapid diagnosis [28] . The limitations of serologic method include Chlamydia pneumoniae IgM or IgG reactivity might be caused by heterotypic antibodies. The test is evidently unable to discriminate between past and persistent infections [29] . Previously, weak positive results were frequently observed in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumonia detection in our lab; the reason needs further clarification. Comparing the methods mentioned above, FilmArray RP has high specificity and sensitivity and could obtain result in a very short time.",

In addition, FilmArray RP results in overall decreased duration of antibiotic use of half a day, a shorter stay (a quarter of a day less) in the hospital following admission and reduced time spent in isolation (a third of a day less) for patients who were viral positive after implementation of the FilmArray RP [12, 31] .
