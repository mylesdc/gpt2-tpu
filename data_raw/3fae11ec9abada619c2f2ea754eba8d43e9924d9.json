            "text": "The technique of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) utilizes four (or six) primers targeting six (or eight) regions within a fairly small segment of a genome for amplification, with concentration higher than that used in traditional PCR methods. The high concentrations of primers used leads to an increased likelihood of non-specific amplification induced by primer dimers. In this study, a set of LAMP primers were designed targeting the prfA gene sequence of Listeria monocytogenes, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as well as Touchdown LAMP were employed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP reactions. The results indicate that the detection limit of this novel LAMP assay with the newly designed primers and additives was 10 fg per reaction, which is ten-fold more sensitive than a commercial Isothermal Amplification Kit and hundred-fold more sensitive than previously reported LAMP assays. This highly sensitive LAMP assay has been shown to detect 11 strains of Listeria monocytogenes, and does not detect other Listeria species (including Listeria innocua and Listeria invanovii), providing some advantages in specificity over commercial Isothermal Amplification Kits and previously reported LAMP assay.",

Moreover, Nagamine et al., has advanced the method by putting forward loop primers that accelerate the LAMP reaction [2] . Therefore, the LAMP assay theoretically has the advantage of specificity, selectivity, and rapidity over polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3, 4] , nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [5, 6] , strand displacement amplification (SDA) [7] , rolling circle amplification (RCA) [8] , helicase dependent amplification (HDA) [9] , and cross-priming amplification assay (CPA) [10, 11] . For practical application of LAMP as well as reduction of the rate of false positive results in LAMP reactions, most researches currently focus on development of closed-tube detection to reduce aerosol pollution and cross pollution, which include the use of turbidity [12] , SYBR Green I [13] , PicoGreen [14] , GelRed TM [15, 16] , lateral flow dipstick [17] , hydroxynaphthol blue dye [18] , malachite green [19] , microfluidic chips and GMR sensors as well as calcein used by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd [20, 21] . However, there is still no report studying non-specific amplification and cause of false positive results in LAMP reactions at present.",

The Tm value and melt curve were obviously different from those of the positive controls, and were therefore as attributed to non-specific amplification, which may be caused by partial complementation among primers of LAMP. The detection time with 10% DMSO was slightly longer than with 7.5%.

The experiment with L. invanovii ATCC49954 was repeated four times and all four repeated reactions were negative. Therefore, the initial false positive result may have been caused by slight aerosol pollution of DNA templates. [19] ; however, the optimized LAMP assay required an extended amplification time of 50 min, and even with the lengthy reaction time, two strains (Listeria monocytogenes J2-064 (stereotype: 1/2b) and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC19115 (stereotype: 4b) were not detected, as shown in Table 4 . Extending the amplification time further to 1 h, led to non-specific amplification of negative controls.",

This is especially true when the concentrations of primers, Mg 2+ , dNTPs and DNA Polymerase in reaction mixtures are as high as those used in Real-time PCR. The concentrations of these 4 factors must be strictly controlled to avoid non-specific amplification in real-time PCR [24] as well as LAMP reactions. There are instances in which standard PCR amplification reaction conditions do not produce acceptable results. Addition of DMSO and use of Touchdown temperature conditions have been used improve PCR results. We investigate these approaches for the first time for optimization of LAMP reactions. Unfortunately, with the information presently available it is not possible to predict which enhancing agent is best for any particular target. But DMSO has been frequently used in this capacity [25] . The results presented here using DMSO in LAMP reaction mixtures indicate that, DMSO can increase amplification with LAMP at low concentration and can inhibit activity of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase. We had tried to enhance the reaction of LAMP with betaine, Tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethylene sulfoxide, and formamide, but their effect was not as good as that of DMSO, because of the limitation of length, no more tautology here. While DMSO may not necessarily be the best enhancing agent [26, 27] , i.e., the manufacturer of the commercial Isothermal Amplification Kit used in this experiment may have found some favorable enhancing agent, but their reagents are proprietary, and DMSO served to decrease non-specific amplification in the specific experiments presented here.",

This improvement may be due to the high temperature inhibiting the formation of primer dimers and promoting the correct combination of primers and template. The biggest advantage of LAMP is that the reaction can be performed isothermally, and people argue all the time that all we need is a simple water bath for the rapid detection, so the advantage may be compromised by the developed Touchdown LAMP assay, we made such efforts here just to reveal or verify the main cause for false positive results of LAMP and inspire people to modify and improve LAMP technology, my colleagues and I have also been looking for a more suitable method, which can not only keep the advantage but also improve the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP.",
