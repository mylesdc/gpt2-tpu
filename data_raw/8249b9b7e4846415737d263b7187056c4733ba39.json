This active field of research has attracted approximately 110 experts in virology and bioinformatics/computational biology from Europe and other parts of the world to attend the two-day meeting in Glasgow to increase scientific exchange between laboratory-and computer-based researchers. The meeting was held at the McIntyre Building of the University of Glasgow; a perfect location, as it was originally built to be a place for \"rubbing your brains with those of other people\", as Rector Stanley Baldwin described it. The goal of the meeting was to provide a meaningful and interactive scientific environment to promote discussion and collaboration and to inspire and suggest new research directions and questions. The meeting featured eight invited and twelve contributed talks, on the four main topics: (1) systems virology, (2) virus-host interactions and the virome, (3) virus classification and evolution and (4) epidemiology, surveillance and evolution. Further, the meeting featured 34 oral poster presentations, all of which focused on specific areas of virus bioinformatics. This report summarizes the main research findings and highlights presented at the meeting.",

            "text": "During the two-day conference, about 110 participants from 20 countries contributed in productive discussion on the four topics: (1) systems virology, (2) virus-host interactions and the virome, (3) virus classification and evolution and (4) epidemiology, surveillance and evolution. A number of high quality presentations were given by leading virologists and junior scientists. In addition to the eight invited speakers, we had twelve talks selected from the contributed submissions (see http://evbc.uni-jena.de/events/3rd-evbc-meeting). It was clear that the distinction between laboratory and computer researchers is often blurred. That collaborating teams of individuals with different skill sets are often a road to success, while individuals working alone can still make massive contributions. Data-driven research is now mainstream, and the scale and complexity of datasets is ever increasing. Discussions highlighted how virology, like all of biology, is now a data science, exploiting methods from dimensionality reduction of large datasets to data visualisation. We took from this that virus bioinformatics is evolving and succeeding as an area of research in its own right at the interface of virology and computer science and that there are many ways to be a successful researcher. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and are mainly associated with respiratory and enteric diseases. In humans, there are four coronaviruses known to cause rather mild respiratory symptoms; however, the appearance of zoonotic viruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, exemplified that coronaviruses can also cause severe and lethal diseases in humans. Within their target cells, coronaviruses replicate their RNA genome at host-derived membranes in the host cell cytoplasm. The Replicase Complex (RC) that is synthesizing the viral RNA is encoded on the genomic RNA and comprises a set of 15-16 non-structural proteins (nsps). Besides canonical functions associated with RNA synthesis, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase and methyltransferases, a wealth of additional enzymatic activities, such as endoribonuclease, ADP-ribosylation and de-ubiquitination, are included within the coronaviral RC, suggesting that various virus-host interactions are taking place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. However, our knowledge about host factors at the interface between the RC and the host cell cytoplasm is rudimentary. To identify the composition of the viral RC and adjacent host cell proteins composing the RC-microenvironment, we engineered a biotin ligase into a coronaviral RC. This allowed us to biotinylate, affinity-purify and identify specifically all viral components constituting the coronavirus RC and host cell proteins that are in close proximity ( Figure 1 ). Amongst the >500 host proteins constituting the RC-microenvironment, we identified numerous proteins associated with vesicular trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related processes and translation initiation. Notably, following the detection of translation initiation factors at the RC, we were able to visualize and demonstrate active translation proximal to the site of viral RNA synthesis of several coronaviruses. Collectively, our work established a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors of unprecedented breadth. Many of the coronavirus RC-proximal host proteins and pathways have also documented roles in the life cycle of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, suggesting considerable commonalities and conserved virus-host interactions at the RCs of a broad range of RNA viruses.",

The classification of pneumonia into Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) and Ventilated-Acquired Pneumonia (VAP) indicates the source of disease by a wide variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Respiratory tract infections and in particular pneumonia represent the most common cause of sepsis [5] . Long-time associated with bacterial infection, sepsis definition became more in focus as a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen, which leads to organ failure [6] . However, Influenza Virus (IV) as a pneumotropic virus can lead to lung failure and systemic host reaction with subsequent multiple organ failure. IV circulates worldwide and causes highly contagious respiratory diseases characterized by mild to severe symptoms. The seasonal IV-associated bronchopneumonia is one of these infectious diseases with the highest population-based mortality rates [7] . Besides virulence factors, the sudden increase of pathogenicity is the most striking problem of influenza accompanied by bacterial co-infection. In a single-centre study conducted at the Jena University Hospital during the winter season 2017/2018, we detected 1197 influenza-virus-positive samples and 89 S. aureus-positive respiratory specimens. However, the diagnosis of a co-infection was significantly lower with 17 samples. Interestingly, the mortality rate increased dramatically from single infection (approximately 20%) to co-infection (approximately 80%). Even larger studies indicating similarly dates and also the Spanish flu of 1918 showed that co-infection results in high mortality rates [8] . While the pathogen-host interaction-induced severe dysregulations of the immune response is under investigation in many studies, the regulatory effects between the different pathogens and the subsequent impact on the host are barely understood. In a multifactorial process, a wide range of pathogen factors and pathogen-regulated signalling events are involved in co-pathogenesis. This process is associated with elevated host-response, changed repair-processes, and modifications in the cellular immune response [9] . It is shown that primary IV-infection inhibits the apoptosis mechanism and the following infection with S. aureus inhibits IV-induced apoptosis by procaspase-8 activation [10] . Various models are available for studying the mechanisms of the viral-bacterial interference. However, the use of murine models is adversely regarded because of obvious discrepancies between men and mice despite the attempts of humanized murine models to fill the gaps. New methods enable investigations with cost-saving and efficient cell culture models as an excellent supplement to animal experiments. Organ-on-a-chip technology allows species-specific investigations for different cell types and also immune cells. Using this method, viral-bacterial interference can be investigated in a human-specific manner. The human respiratory epithelium is a pseudostratified epithelium that constitutes the first line of defence against invading respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses. Although several studies have now shown that both viral transcript production and the innate immune response to infection vary widely among single influenza-infected cells, the cause of this extreme heterogeneity remains unclear [11, 12] . More specifically, it remains unknown how key innate immune components are distributed among the different cell populations found in the respiratory epithelium and how the latter may influence the host response to infection. To determine the distribution of these innate immune components and to examine how specific cell types respond to influenza infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to acquire transcriptomes from primary human Airway Epithelial Cells (hAEC) infected with Influenza A Virus (IAV) ( Figure 2 ) [13] . A low MOI was used to infect hAECs with either Wild-Type (WT) pandemic IAV or an NS1mutated form of the virus (NS1R38A) that impairs its ability to counteract Interferon (IFN) and produces an amplified innate immune response. We then annotated both host and viral transcriptomes of more than 19,000 single cells across the five major hAEC cell types for mock, WT, and NS1R38A conditions. We observed a large heterogeneity in viral burden; however, in contrast to what was found in previous studies, no absence of viral genes was detected. Interestingly, in both WT-and NS1R38A-infected cultures, there was a significant decrease in the fraction of ciliated and goblet cells compared to mock hAECs. We also identified a number of cell-type-specific innate immune responses, including the expression of type I and III IFNs in all major cell types. Collectively, our results represent the first comprehensive report on how individual cells contribute to the antiviral response during IAV infection in the context of the human respiratory epithelium.

Besides being the ultimate bacterial killers, phages can change bacterial surfaces to prevent recognition by the human immune system. In cystic fibrosis, they can allow their hosts to cope with anaerobic conditions found in mucus-laden lungs, and in many bacteria, they encode potent toxins [14] .

            "text": "Viral mutation rates (including recombination rates) have remained difficult to quantify due to a lack of evolutionary calibration points. For example, on a short time scale of thirty years, a constant recombination rate of five events per year has been observed for Siphoviridae bacteriophages [31] , but when longer timespans are assessed, mutation rate estimates may drop dramatically by orders of magnitude [32] . One way of obtaining ancient calibration points in viral evolution in the absence of fossil data is by exploiting their association to hosts. One of the most conserved constituents of the human gut virome is the widespread and abundant bacteriophage crAssphage [23] . Recently, near-complete genome sequences of crAss-like viruses were detected in faecal samples of a range of wild non-human primates living on different continents, including Old-World monkeys, New-World monkeys and apes [33] . Strikingly, these genomes revealed a strong collinearity with human-associated crAss-like viruses, suggesting that the association of crAss-like viruses with the primate gut biome may be millions of years old. Moreover, these findings open the door to investigations into viral mutation rates at long time-scales, once again illustrating how viral metagenomics opens up a treasure trove for virus discovery [34] , as well as evolutionary analyses of these smallest and most abundant biological entities on Earth. Viromics or viral metagenomics has been proposed as an alternative method to qPCR-based approaches for the detection of pathogenic viruses linked to food-and water-borne illness in the aquatic environment [35, 36] . The main advantage is that viral communities can be investigated without prior knowledge of the genome sequences or genotypes of the viruses present in the sample. There are, however, several drawbacks associated with viromics, such as laboratory and computational costs, scalability and the issue of viral dark matter in which sequence data are classified as \"unknown\". In her presentation, Evelien Adriaenssens focused on the latter aspect and showed that reconstruction of Uncultivated Virus Genomes (UViGs) [37] and classification into families reduced the fraction of completely unknown sequences, particularly for RNA viruses. Using read mapping approaches followed by visualisation and analysis with Anvi'o [38] , she showed that they can identify pathogenic virus genomes present in the Conwy River catchment area, mainly found in wastewater [39] , and showed changing abundance patterns between sample sites and types. Using species-level clustering and differential read mapping, comparative genomics and phylogenetics, she could gradually descend from the bigger picture of viral diversity to strain-level resolution, identifying the genotype of potentially pathogenic viruses. This workflow is ideally suited to find new pathogenic viral species and identify markers for wastewater contamination of the environment.",

Methodological advances, such as High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS), and new capabilities to recover and assemble genome sequences has unearthed vast numbers of previously-undescribed viruses from environmental, human clinical, veterinary and plant samples. How such viruses can be incorporated into the current virus taxonomy is a major challenge, especially at the family and species levels, which have been historically based largely on descriptive taxon definitions of phenotypic properties that \"sequence-only\" viruses often lack. These assignments typically encapsulate descriptions of replication strategies, virion structure, and clinical and epidemiological features, such as host range, geographical distribution and disease outcomes. If \"sequence-only\" viruses are to be formally placed into the classification maintained by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as recently proposed [40] , then their assignments will have to be based largely or entirely on metrics of genetic relatedness and any other features that might be inferred from their genome sequences. However, there are no published guidelines in the ICTV code on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered as new species or new families (https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code).",

For eukaryotic viruses, there was large-scale consistency between such genetic relationships and their current family-and genus-level taxonomic assignments, irrespective of genome configurations and genome sizes. The analysis pipeline, \"Genome Relationships Applied to Virus Taxonomy\" (GRAViTy), diagrammatically summarised in Figure 4 , predicted family membership of eukaryotic viruses with close to 100% accuracy and specificity; this method should therefore enable the vast collection of metagenomic sequences to be classified in a manner consistent with the current ICTV taxonomy. Preliminary analysis of such datasets revealed that over one half (460/921) of (near)-complete genome sequences from recently-generated eukaryotic virus datasets could be assigned to 127 novel family-level groupings, more than double the number of eukaryotic virus families in the ICTV taxonomy.",

            "text": "The field of ancient DNA covers a wide range of research topics, spanning from human evolution, megafauna to pathogen evolution. Despite the recent advantages in ancient DNA techniques and modern metagenomic screening tools, the identification of authentic viral sequences from ancient material is still challenging. The materials that are mainly used in ancient DNA research, teeth and petrous bones, already limit the number of detectable viruses by their nature. Only viruses that are present in the bloodstream can be detected. The fast evolution of viral pathogens and therefore the comparability to modern variability in viruses makes it even more difficult to identify their ancestors reliably. The highly-fragmented and degraded nature of ancient genetic material and the high risk of modern contamination are causing further problems in the analysis. For the detection of viruses, a wide variety of software utilizing different approaches like HMMs, dedicated marker genes and complete genome references are available to screen these ancient samples for the presence of pathogens. Each of these approaches has its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses. In a competitive alignment approach using all complete virus genomes as a reference, we were able to detect three Hepatitis-B Viruses (HBV) during our regular screening. All three samples originated in Germany and dated to the mediaeval times (1000 BP) and the Neolithic (5000 and 7000 BP). After sequencing and competitive mapping against 16 HBV references, complete HBV genomes could be recovered from all three samples. This resulted in the oldest human pathogenic viral genome that is known up to know. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the medieval strain was genotype D and surprisingly conserved. The ancient Neolithic strains were closer together than to any other modern and closest to strains from Old-World monkeys. These findings might suggest reciprocal cross-species transmission between human and ape. Furthermore, we could show that the genomic structure of ancient strains closely resembles the structure of modern HBV strains. Since publishing these results, we and others detected more HBV-positive samples, supporting the notion that viruses will become more important for the aDNAcommunity ( Figure 5 ). The new HBV genomes we reconstructed support our earlier findings. A bigger number of HBV cases spanning over longer time frames opens the door for reliable diachronic analysis and maybe even epidemiological analysis. Besides the recent findings of ancient viruses (e.g., Parvovirus), an open question still remains how we could detect and reconstruct extinct or highly-altered virus genomes. Bioinformatic protocols for the detection of unknown viral protein families based on long sequencing reads and high coverage data are published and available, but due to the above-described nature of aDNA, applying these methods is not straightforward, and strong optimization needs to be carried out. Still, these HBV and other findings have opened a new door within the aDNA community and blazed a trail for upcoming viral ancient DNA studies. This work was done by a team composed of Ben Krause-Kyora, Julian Susat, Felix M. Key, Denise K\u00fchnert, Alexander Immel, Alexander Herbig, Almut Nebel and Johannes Krause. [43] [44] [45] ; C: one ancient strain [46] ; B: one ancient strain [45] ; A: two new ancient strains, three ancient strains [45] Viruses are not always pathogens, and they are also an important and inseparable part of the biosphere and should be studied as such. Unfortunately, the wider functional and evolutionary role of viruses in the biosphere is not yet widely accepted in most disciplines, a good exception being marine biology/ecology, where viruses are already accepted as important players. How the virosphere is related to the rest of the biosphere can be examined in several different ways. One of these ways is a protein domain-based view. We analysed how virosphere protein domain occurrence is related to the occurrence of protein domains in all (sequenced) organisms (we called the last the phylogenomic space of protein domains). This is based on the distribution of protein domains in viruses and in organisms (by superkingdom), i.e., which protein domains are found in viruses (or a specific set of viruses) and to what extent and where these domains are found elsewhere in organisms. In our analysis, we used predefined protein domain databases Pfam, Superfamily and Gene3D. Domains found in the virosphere can be found in a different number of organisms, starting from a few organisms for some viral domains up to all organisms in the others. However, if we specify a narrower set of viruses (Baltimore class, viral family or host range), differences between viral taxons appear. Therefore, the heterogeneity of viruses is also very clearly expressed by where in the phylogenomic space the domains that are found in different viral taxons are located. A few examples are shown in Figure 6 . An important conclusion from our analysis is the existence of virosphere-specific protein domains (domains not found in cellular organisms), even at the level of structural homology. Several evolutionary routes that may lead to virosphere specificity (absence in cellular organisms) will be discussed. Considering the new knowledge on virus-to-host gene transfers in eukaryotes during the last ten years, it is clear that the virosphere is a source of functional and structural novelties also for this superkingdom. A possible route for the genesis of novel domains in viruses (as well as in organisms) is double coding or overprinted genes. We have developed a web-tool cRegions (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/cRegions/), which helps to find potential double coding regions (and other embedded functional elements) in coding sequences [47, 48] . Of course, there exist many domains that are shared by viruses and organisms. Beside others, virus-to-host gene transfer is one process leading to shared domains. A number of examples for this kind of transfer have been described; however, they are all based on sequence-to-sequence comparison. Taking into account the very fast evolution of viruses, the sequence similarity may fall below the confidential detection limit relatively fast. We applied structure-guided information to detect more ancestral virus-to-host transfers. Our data show that \"as a proof of principle\", using protein structure-guided HMM models, it is possible to detect V2Htransfers not \"visible\"; with BLAST analysis. Figure 6 . Distribution of the protein domains found in three viral families according to their occurrence in different superkingdoms. Protein domains as they are defined in SCOPat the superfamily level and the occurrence of these domains according to Superfamily assignment (www.supfam.org).

This is achieved with an iterative combination of the sequence-based aligner MAFFT [51] and the structure-based aligner LocARNA [52] . For our example case, we were able to predict structures in the genus Flavivirus [53] that are consistent with described structures in the literature (Figure 7) . Further, we predicted novel structural elements in coding regions of genomes. [53] . The resulting alignment calculated by VeGETA has structure annotations for the complete genomes, including 5' UTR, coding regions and 3' UTR. Here, we extracted the 5' UTR from the alignment and visualized the annotated structure elements. These elements agree with the literature [54] , as we were able to reconstruct the SLA, SLL, SLBand cHPelements accurately. The first two elements were recognized by the viral replication mechanism (NS5) [55] . The sequence embedded in the SLB structure is known to play a role in the genome circularization of flaviviruses [56] , whereas the cHP facilitates the translation of the coding region by pausing the translation machinery and finding the correct starting triplet [57] .

Furthermore the clade to which the H5N8 strains belong is unusual because unlike the highly-pathogenic H5N1 strains, they reassort frequently, picking up different neuraminidase subtypes. By using both host and neuraminidase subtype as discrete traits, it was also shown that reassortment was preferentially occurring in Anseriformes species (ducks, geese, etc.).",

            "text": "Avian Influenza A Viruses (AIVs) circulate among wild and domestic bird populations worldwide. While some strains only cause mild to asymptomatic infections, known as Low Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LP), High Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HP) can have an extremely high mortality rate in both domestic and wild bird populations, leading to huge economic loses ( Figure 8A ) [61] . Thus, surveillance of AIVs is crucial for early detection of outbreaks. Although virulence is a polygenic trait, molecular determinants of virulence have been well characterised for AIVs, such as a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site within the hemagglutinin protein, which enables a systemic viral spread within the host [62] . We hypothesise that the parallel evolution of HP lineages from LP ancestors may have been facilitated by permissive or compensatory secondary mutations occurring anywhere in the viral genome, preceding or following the appearance of a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site. We used a comparative phylogenetic and structural approach to detect shared mutations evolving under positive selection across the whole genome of HP AIVs of the H7NX and H5NX subtypes and developed a model that statistically assesses genotype-phenotype associations. We present cumulative evolutionary and structural evidence that supports the association between parallel mutations and the evolution of the HP phenotype. Parallel mutations occur frequently among HP lineages of the same viral subtype ( Figure 8B ). Many of the mutations have been previously determined to increase viral fitness in terms of their biological properties, whilst most of these are ranked as stabilising to protein structure, supporting that these are rather permissive/compensatory. The mutational panel provided here may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. Circulating AIVs that do not have a polybasic cleavage site yet, but show all or some of the amino acid changes ranked, should remain under surveillance. Year of circulation, virus subtype and consensus sequence for the polybasic Cleavage Site (pCS) within the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein are indicated for the selected outbreaks used in this work (C1-C9). Each outbreak corresponds to a distinct genotype, defined as well-supported clusters within all viral genome segment trees (data not shown). (B) MCCtree for the HA protein with reconstruction of ancestral states for site 143, as mutation A143T was found to be evolving under parallel evolution and to be associated with the HP phenotype, occurring in 4/9 of the HP clusters analysed. This mutation is a non-conservative amino acid change located within an antigenic pocket site. Branches within the trees are coloured according to the corresponding amino acid states in nodes (tip states not shown). Ancestral nodes preceding the emergence of a mutation associated with the HP lineages are represented with coloured circles. The probabilities of a given amino acid state occurring within ancestral/descending nodes are indicated. The HP clusters of interest are highlighted with blue circles. Mutations strongly associated with an HP phenotype may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages.",

However, for the majority of human RNA virus species, human infections are acquired only from non-human reservoirs. The evolution of human transmissibility is poorly understood. Through parallel analyses of 1755 RNA viruses, we identified at least 90 nodes across 39 genus-level phylogenies associated with transitions involving the gain of human infectivity and/or transmissibility. Human-infective and human-transmissible viruses evolve independently, and at least 73% of human-transmissible RNA virus lineages emerged directly from non-human virus lineages in diverse mammal or bird taxa. Negative sense single-stranded RNA virus lineages generate a higher proportion of strictly zoonotic viruses. Our analysis demonstrates that RNA viruses from mammal/bird lineages not currently known to be infective to humans are a likely source of future epidemics in human populations, a public health threat recently designated \"Disease X\".",

Phylodynamics for Tracking Epidemic, Endemic and Evolving Viral Strains, by Samantha Lycett Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens in animal and livestock populations can have important economic and health consequences globally. The ability to foresee where, in which host species and under what conditions outbreaks could occur is key to developing prevention and control strategies. Sequencing pathogens from infected animals has become much more affordable and widespread in recent years, especially during outbreaks and in endemic disease settings with targeted surveillance programmes. Consequently, there are growing collections of animal virus sequences from around the globe. In this talk, the use of viral sequence data together with phylodynamic methodologies for understanding the transmission patterns in animal populations was discussed, using Avian Influenza (AI), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) as examples",
