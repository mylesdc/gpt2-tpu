This study aimed to characterize the diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) by identifying the starting point of the epidemic as well as climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence and intensity of transmission of the disease. The study was carried out in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1 , where H1N1 caused the largest impact. The units of spatial and temporal analysis were the municipality of residence of the cases and the epidemiological weeks of the year 2009, respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm, parametric inference was performed through a two-part spatiotemporal model and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) algorithm. We identified the most likely starting points through the effective distance measure based on mobility networks. The proposed estimation methodology allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, and provided evidence of different patterns for chance of occurrence and risk of influenza throughout the epidemiological weeks. The results indicate the capital city of Curitiba as the probable starting point, and showed that the interventions that focus on municipalities with greater migration and density of people, especially those with higher Human Development Indexes (HDIs) and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigation of effects of future influenza pandemics on public health. These results provide important information on the process of introduction and spread of influenza, and could contribute to the identification of priority areas for surveillance as well as establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control. The proposed model also allows identification of epidemiological weeks with high chance of influenza occurrence, which can be used as a reference criterion for creating an immunization campaign schedule.

From an epidemiological point of view, influenza epidemics and pandemics are associated with changes in the structure of society that favor the spread of new strains in specific ecological, social, and spatial contexts [1] . The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged from the combination of genetic segments from the human influenza virus, avian influenza virus, and swine influenza virus, and was first identified in April 2009 in Mexico and the United States [2] . The virus spread rapidly across the globe and on June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared influenza A (H1N1) as a pandemic [2] . In April 2009, preventive actions were initiated to delay entry of the virus to Brazil. In border regions, seaports and airports began to utilize sound alerts and distribute information for the purpose of early identification of symptomatic individuals. Despite these efforts, on July 16, 2009 , the Ministry of Health officially announced sustained transmission of the H1N1 virus in the Brazilian territory [3] . The first cases of H1N1 influenza in Brazil were imported from countries that already had sustained transmission of the disease [4] . According to Ministry of Health data, up to the epidemiological week (EW) 47 (11/22/2009 to 11/28/2009), 30,055 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) had been registered, with 93% identified as resulting from H1N1 infections. The H1N1 pandemic disproportionately affected the southern and southeast regions of Brazil, with Paran\u00e1 being the most affected state, accounting for 52% of the total cases reported in the country [5] . Despite low lethality rates, the rapid spread of the disease generated panic in Paran\u00e1. As in other parts of the country and the world, preventive measures were taken, such as the closure of schools, restaurants, and public places, in addition to social distancing and changes in hygiene habits [6] . Although the 2009 pandemic provided extensive knowledge and experience for public health professionals, the mechanism responsible for the spread of influenza is not yet fully understood [7] . The present study modeled the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in Paran\u00e1, using efficient computational methods to identify climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the chance of H1N1 introduction and, once introduced, the intensity of spread within the city. The model was further used to identify the most-likely starting points of H1N1 diffusion into the state of Paran\u00e1. These results will contribute to evaluation of timely control measures and decision making by public health authorities.",

The average temperature in the state is 18.5\u02daC, and the climate is divided into two regimes: a tropical regime that predominates in the North, West, and Coastal areas with average temperatures of 22\u02daC, and a subtropical or temperate regime in the mid-southern area with average temperatures between 10\u02daC and 22\u02daC. Tourism is one of the main sectors of the economy, and Paran\u00e1 has the 5th highest Human Development Index (HDI) in Brazil. The population of Paran\u00e1 is about four times less than in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, with 11 million inhabitants; approximately 2 million reside in Curitiba, the state capital and most populous municipality. Iguazu falls, at the border between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, is also an important touristic region attracting people around the world.",

Any medical doctor diagnosing a suspected case should notify to the National Notification System, SINAN [8] . Suspected cases were subsequentely confirmed or discarded based on the results of laboratory tests or by ascertaining an epidemiological link between the suspected case and a previously confirmed one. Laboratory testing was carried out in 27% of the suspected cases. In July 2009, there was a recommendation for restricting notification to patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) only. However, in Paran\u00e1, this recommendation was not followed, as the proportion of mild cases remained high throughout the epidemic [5] . Time series of influenza cases were created by summing the number of weekly confirmed and autochthonous cases, from April 5 to September 26, 2009 . We used the municipalities of residence as the spatial unit for analysis, and epidemiological week of symptom onset as the temporal unit for analysis. On some occasions, there was no record for initial day of symptoms. In these cases, missing data were estimated using imputation technique, and the corresponding value for first day of symptoms was calculated as 2.76 days prior to the day-of-report (the mean time between onset of symptoms and notification of illness), following the estimation of Code\u00e7o et al.

Climatic factors may also influence human behavior with regard to contact rate and aggregation patterns. Poverty rate and HDI can be important global determinants of flu occurrence and intensity since they are markers of vulnerabilities that includes health, education and income components. Intercity bus, boat and airplane transportation are supposed to impact the chance of occurrence, since they facilitate the displacement of people between municipalities. Also, pendular migration can increase the occurrence of flu since it favors the disease dissemination. As influenza virus spreads through human contact, population density and bus transportation are potential factors to increase the intensity of transmission. Also, the density of physicians is supposed to impact the intensity of the disease because reflect municipalities' development and health workforce.

In order to assess the municipality(ies) that is(are) more likely to be the starting point(s) for Influenza A (H1N1) introduction in the State of Paran\u00e1 during the 2009 pandemic, we tested the correlation between the shortest path tree of candidate municipalities against the estimated arrival times in the remaining municipalities. In order to do that, we calculated the shortest path tree C j for each of the potential sites of origin of the epidemic and the arrival times of the epidemic. The arrival times in each municipality were defined (using results of the spatiotemporal model described above) as the first epidemiological week in which the probability of having an excess chance of influenza was greater than 0.90.

During the study period, influenza cases were mainly concentrated in the municipalities within the metropolitan, northern, and western regions of Paran\u00e1, where the highest rates of the disease were observed. In general, the maps suggest that higher altitudes and poverty rates may be related to a lower concentration of cases. Municipal HDI, demographic and medical densities, and pendular migration presented heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns compatible with the most affected regions of the state. Higher rates of influenza were observed in municipalities with primary means of transport with the exception of intercity highways, where this relationship was not confirmed. The was no apparent relationship between the total number of cases reported weekly and climate covariates. Table 1 shows the effects of covariates that were retained in the final spatiotemporal model, expressed in terms of chance ratio and the relative risk of the disease in Paran\u00e1. We found that pendular migration, presence of air transport, and HDI significantly contributed to increase the chance of influenza. Population density, municipal road transport, municipal HDI and maximum temperature represented risk factors for the disease intensity. The effect of the covariate maximum lagged temperature of one week (lag 1) was assumed to vary over time, and therefore is omitted from Table 1. The variables minimum temperature, relative humidity, altitude, poverty rate, and medical density were not included in the spatiotemporal model due to multicollinearity. Presence of boat transportation in the municipality, the existence of intercity road transport, and rainfall did not contribute significantly to either the chance of occurrence or intensity of influenza A (H1N1) in Paran\u00e1 and were also not included in the final regression model.",

The actions recommended for this phase were aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality due to the disease through the early diagnosis and treatment of cases that presented greater risk for severe outcomes or death. In EWs 14 through 18, the period of introduction of the virus in Brazil, there was a significant increase in the incidence of influenza A associated with increased temperature.

Analogously, the value of the temporal correlation coefficient \u03c1 = 0.509(0.508 \u2212 0.511) confirms the short-term persistence of the number of confirmed and autochthonous cases of influenza A (H1N1). An effect significantly different from zero was also observed for the parameter that relates the effects of the spatiotemporal interaction of both processes, such that \u03d5 = 0.211(0.208 \u2212 0.216) indicates that the occurrence of cases of the disease also have a heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern. Fig 6 shows the map of the posterior probabilities of infuenza A (H1N1) chance exceeds 1 for some epidemiological weeks. As we are particularly interested in increased chance, we can visualize the level of uncertainty associated with estimating the chance of influenza when it is greater than 1. The probability maps revealed heterogeneity in the diffusion process of influenza A in Paran\u00e1, expliciting underlying geographical differences which caused some municipalities to reach the peak of the epidemic before others. There was high chance of influenza A in the capital Curitiba in the first week of April (EW 14), when the virus was installed in the national territory. From EW 24 (06/14 to 06/20), outbreaks of virus began to spread, concentrating mainly on sites that were geographically distant but important from a socioeconomic perspective. Beginning with EW 28 (07/12 to 07/18), there was a substantial increase in the probability of occurrence of influenza cases in Paran\u00e1 as a whole, characterizing the beginning of the sustained transmission period according to an official announcement from the Ministry of Health. The epidemic spread rapidly throughout the state, reaching the peak for chance of occurrence in EW 31 (08/02 to 08/08). Overall, from EW 35 (08/30 to 09/05) onwards, there was a progressive reduction in the chance of influenza occurrence, culminating in EW 38 (09/20 to 09/26) when few municipalities still had a high probability of disease occurrence, mainly those in which the virus was identified precociously. Fig 7 shows the excess of influenza risk, that is, in the probability P(Risk > 1). In EW 14 (04/05 to 04/11), which marked the beginning of the study period, the probability of excess risk was considered low for all municipalities of Paran\u00e1. However, in EW 25 (06/21 to 06/ 27), a period of high risk of transmission, there was an increased risk of influenza in the state capital, Curitiba. From EW 29 (07/19 to 07/25), the week following the official announcement of sustained transmission of the disease, there were significant increases in the risk of influenza A for two of the most populous municipalities in the western region of Paran\u00e1, two municipalities in the southwest and northwest regions, and another in the north-central region, in addition to Curitiba, which maintained a high risk. Since then, other areas of dissemination appeared, increasing the risk of spread of the disease, especially to neighboring municipalities. From EW 32, there was a slow and progressive reduction of the risk of influenza A (H1N1). At EW 38, the risk of disease transmission was considered low for all municipalities. Fig 8 illustrates the analysis of candidate municipalities as the starting points of the spatial diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) in Paran\u00e1 in 2009. The values in the center of the blue squares in the first column of the matrix represent the Spearman correlation coefficients between the time of arrival of the epidemic and the effective distance. The upper triangular part of the matrix shows the scatter plots which produced the correlation coefficients for each of the candidate municipalities. As expected, regardless of origin the greater the effective distance of the candidate municipality, the longer the arrival time of the epidemic. It is also easily observable that the municipalities of Pinhais and Curitiba presented the highest correlations and, therefore, are strong candidates for the origin of the process of diffusion of influenza. It is noteworthy that the connectivity matrices and, consequently, the effective distances for both municipalities, are quite similar (correlation equal to 0.94). This is due to the fact that Pinhais has a very strong connection to Curitiba, the State Capital. The number of individuals frequently traveling to Curitiba is 20 times larger than to the second main destination, and concentrates almost 84% of the flow from Pinhais. Therefore, the paths from Pinhais to other municipalities are mostly governed by those from the Capital.",

The proposed methodology for estimation allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, which showed different patterns throughout the epidemiological weeks for the occurrence and intensity of influenza transmission. Pendular migration data have been increasingly used to describe population mobility in epidemic models [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The present study showed that the pendular migration is significantly associated with the chance of occurrence of influenza, such that municipalities with greater flow of people have a greater chance of occurrence of the disease.

            "text": "In addition to sociodemographic factors that may favor the establishment and maintenance of the virus in individuals, it is also known that influenza virus is better adapted to replicate at temperatures lower than the average for most common infectious agents [42] . Temperature may also directly or indirectly influence human behavior with regard to contact rate and aggregation patterns in ways that increase the risk of disease transmission [43] . Our results showed that maximum temperature in the week prior to case reports significantly affected the risk of influenza for several weeks. We found evidence early on that an increase in maximum temperature favored increased risk of influenza, possibly reflecting patterns of human aggregation. This counterintuitive result may be partially explained by the fact that with lower temperatures, people leave the home less, which may reduce the intensity of transmission. In Brisbane, Australia, Hu et al. [44] observed significant increases in the incidence of influenza A (H1N1) associated with decreases in maximum temperature with a one-week lag. Lopez et al. [45] also found a negative correlation between temperature and the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) in a semi-arid region in India. In this study, a significant increase in the risk of influenza transmission was associated with a drop in temperature from weeks 21 to 28. From an ecological point of view, few authors have verified the impact of climatic factors on influenza in tropical regions, where temperatures and relative humidity are generally higher [46] [47] [48] . In addition, to our knowledge there are no studies that consider that the effect of temperature on the risk of influenza can vary over time, as proposed in this work.",

The municipalities of Pinhais and Curitiba proved to be strong candidates for the origin of spatial diffusion of influenza. According to the Gazeta do Povo newspaper on July 18, 2009 (page 4), \"a 24-year-old man may have been the first victim of influenza A (H1N1), known as swine flu, in the Curitiba region\". The Hospital and Maternity Ward of Pinhais was quarantined in July 2009 for disinfection, and four employees who lived with infected patients were given temporary leave as a means of prevention [6] . From a methodological point of view, this result showed how complex spatiotemporal patterns of propagation can become surprisingly simple, if measures of conventional geographical distances are replaced by the probabilistic concept of effective distance.",

            "text": "The present study does have a few limitations. First, a common limitation in ecological studies is the inability to control for effects of confounding factors at the individual level. A second limitation is probable sources of information bias, including under-reporting in asymptomatic persons, infected persons that do not seek medical help, or as a result of changes in the reporting system that occurred after July 1, at which point diagnostic efforts were focused on cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, risk groups, and outbreaks. Collected during an emergency scenario and restricted to clinical cases, the data do not provide a full picture of the influenza transmission landscape. It is possible that detection differed between municipalities. On the positive side, previous analysis showed that Paran\u00e1 had the most sensitive surveillance system among the Brazilian states, with significantly higher reporting rate of mild cases [5] . Within the state the three metropolitan regions, Curitiba, Foz do Igua\u00e7u and Londrina-Maring\u00e1, presented similar mild-to-severe ratios, suggesting a certain level of homogeneity in the notification pattern. Finally, due to lack of available information the temporal data associated with some explanatory variables differs from that of the dependent variable. For example, the reported cases of influenza refer to 2009, while the covariates poverty rate, municipal HDI, and migration data were derived from the 2010 Census. It is, however, reasonable to assume that sociodemographic information did not undergo significant changes over the course of a single year.",
