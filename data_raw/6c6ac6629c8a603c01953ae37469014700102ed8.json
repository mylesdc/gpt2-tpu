All hospice care programs in Taiwan until then had been hospital-based. A universal health insurance program started in Taiwan in 1995 and now covers nearly all inhabitants (21,984,415 beneficiaries at the end of 2003, equivalent to a coverage rate of 97.3%) [12] . During the early years of National Health Insurance (NHI), admission to hospice wards was reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, as in acute wards. The payment for services of nurses and other ancillary staff was included in the room fee. This method of reimbursement put the intensive-care hospice at a great disadvantage. After years of negotiation, the Bureau of National Health Insurance began to implement a special program for hospice wards in July 2000. The payment changed to a per-diem lump sum and was generally improved. Any hospice ward was free to join the new program, which also had stricter requirements on personnel and facilities.",

After computing the utilization of hospice beds for each day, we found that there were indeed cyclic fluctuations around the year. Because data were only available for a few years and the numbers of hospice wards and beds had increased over time, it did not seem appropriate to deploy a conventional time series analysis, e.g. the autoregressive integrated moving average method [3, 4, 17] . Instead, we performed a before-and-after comparison of monthly utilizations between 2002 and 2003 and plotted daily utilization. The analysis was limited to those hospitals that offered hospice inpatient services throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. Because insurance claims were normally submitted after the patients' discharge, the claims for the final month of the available datasets contained no data for patients who were still hospitalised at the end of that month. Thus, the data for December 2003 were not analysed.",

The unit of hospice/hospital ward utilization was the patient-day, i.e. each claimed day of hospitalisation. Conventionally, the discharge day is not counted as a hospitalisation day in insurance claims. For example, if a patient was hospitalised from 1 January to 7 January, the per-diem fees for physician and room services were payable only from 1 January to 6 January. We used two-sample t-tests to compare the age distributions of those admitted in May/June 2003 with those admitted in May/June 2002, and Pearson's chi-square test to compare the sex and diagnosis distributions. We also used one-way analysis of variance to compare the age distributions of those admitted in May/ June 2003 to hospice wards of different accreditation levels and locations. A P-value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Release 13.0 for Windows, 2004, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Taiwan The influence of the SARS epidemic on hospice utilization varied widely among the 15 wards studied (Table 1) . Even during the peak period of the epidemic, three wards showed growth in utilization and one was unchanged, while two seemed temporarily to cease operating. The recovery also varied from ward to ward: two months after the epidemic, four wards still showed a reduction in utilization of more than 20%.",

One could well imagine that the use of hospice services would be compromised because of fears during uncertain times. Our findings support this view.

Health consequences might not be a big issue among hospice patients. Instead, quality of care and humanity are the major concerns. The aggregate utilization of the 15 hospice wards during the peak period of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan was lower than that during the Chinese New Year holidays ( Figure  1 ). Like Christmas to Christians, the Chinese New Year holidays are important to most Chinese as occasions of family reunion. Usually hospital activities are kept to a minimum on these days. The daily curve of hospice utilization vividly illustrated the impact of the SARS epidemic. Hospice March/April May/June July/August September/October [15] .

In retrospect, it was reasonable and preferable to reduce hospitalisations. A similar phenomenon was observed simultaneously in childbirth in Taiwan [7] . Many deliveries were shifted from secondary and tertiary care hospitals to primary clinics. The question remains whether continu- ity and quality of care could be ensured. It is unlikely that patients shifted from the 15 hospices in the current study to the other six (unanalysed) hospices, which either quitted or joined the hospice program after the SARS epidemic. However, the possibility of patient flow to other non-hospice wards cannot be excluded. Our claims-based study could not determine whether the needs of patients with terminal illnesses were met during the epidemic, and threw no light on the psychological impact on patients and healthcare workers [20] .",
