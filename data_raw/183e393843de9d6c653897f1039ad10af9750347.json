            "text": "Background: Mathematical and statistical models are used to project the future time course of infectious disease epidemics and the expected future burden on health care systems and economies. Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemics-and the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamics-modellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (\"delay distributions\") were known. Methods: We estimated delay distributions in the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2006 and 2010. To do so, we used encrypted health insurance numbers to link 1.34 billion health care billing records to 4.27 million hospital inpatient stays. Because the four year period we studied included three typical influenza seasons and the 2009 influenza pandemic, we were able to compare the delay distributions in non-pandemic and pandemic settings. We also estimated conditional probabilities such as the probability of hospitalization within the year if diagnosed with influenza. Results: In non-pandemic [pandemic] years, delay distribution medians (inter-quartile ranges) were: Service to Admission 6.3 days (0.1-17.6 days) [2.4 days (-0.3-13.6 days)], Admission to Discharge 3 days (1.4-5.9 days) [2.6 days (1.2-5.1 days)], Admission to Death 5.3 days (2.1-11 days) [6 days (2.6-13.1 days)]. (Service date is defined as the date, within the year, of the first health care billing that included a diagnostic code for influenza-like-illness.) Among individuals diagnosed with either pneumonia or influenza in a given year, 19% [16%] were hospitalized within the year and 3% [2%] died in hospital. Among all individuals who were hospitalized, 10% [12%] were diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the year and 5% [5%] died in hospital. Conclusion: Our empirical delay distributions and conditional probabilities should help facilitate more accurate forecasts in the future, including improved predictions of hospital bed demands during influenza outbreaks, and the expected effects of hospitalizations on epidemic dynamics.",

Much effort has been invested in mathematical modeling of influenza dynamics in order to design improved control strategies [4, 5] and to estimate their economic impacts [6] . A fundamental limitation of such studies is a lack of quantitative information concerning the relationships between influenza infection and health care system utilization. In particular, how should we expect changes in influenza transmission dynamics induced by control measures [5, 7, 8] to translate into (i) changes in influenzaassociated visits to physicians' offices or hospitals and (ii) health care system burdens from influenza-associated hospitalizations?",

Then, we filtered all individuals with influenza-like illnesses that had a hospitalization record in DAD. We were therefore able to establish relationships between physician visits associated with influenza-like illness and hospitalization (even if influenza or pneumonia was listed in only one record of the sequence for a given patient). Note that individuals who have influenza-like illnesses and present with pneumonia are often given a diagnosis of pneumonia rather than influenza.

For example, P(Hospitalized | P&I diagnosis) is defined as the probability that an individual who was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during a given influenza year was hospitalized during that year; the reason for hospitalization may not have been related to pneumonia or influenza. Similarly, P(P&I diagnosis | Hospitalized) denotes the probability that someone who was hospitalized during the influenza year was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza that year; the P&I diagnosis might have occurred before, during or after the hospitalization. The one exception is the final row of Table 4 , where P(Died in hospital | Hospitalized) denotes the probability that someone who was hospitalized during a given influenza year died in hospital that year, which could have happened only after hospitalization (though potentially after multiple distinct hospitalizations); note that P(Hospitalized | Died in hospital) would not be exactly 1 because some individuals who died in hospital in a given influenza year were hospitalized before the beginning of that influenza year.

Pneumonia stands out as having smaller fluctuations over the course of the week. Figure 2 shows the weekly billings time series over each of the four influenza years in our data set. All the diagnoses display an annual oscillation. Pneumonia and tonsilitis have the least pronounced cycle while influenza has the most pronounced cycle. All diagnoses, including pneumonia, show a stronger seasonal peak during the 2009-2010 influenza season, which was dominated by pandemic H1N1. The dips just before the New Year are presumably driven by the holiday season (and associated delays in processing records), as is the case for well-known childhood disease time series [11] . We note that virological testing practices for influenza changed in Ontario during the 2009 pandemic. While fairly systematic testing was conducted for the first few months of the outbreak, testing restrictions were imposed in mid June 2009 [12] . The extent to which this policy change influenced the number of OHIP billing diagnoses is not clear.

Figure 3 reveals that short delays (e.g., < 30 days) are most common overall; the exceptions are a very long tail in the distribution of delays from service to admission, and a roughly flat distribution for influenza-related service to mortality (for which sample sizes may be too small to draw confident conclusions). Delay distributions are similar for influenza and \"other respiratory\" diseases; pneumonia generally has a longer time from admission to discharge or mortality. The latter pattern may be driven by the more substantial negative tail of delays from service to admission, which represents people who were admitted to hospital during the focal season but were first billed for services relating to one of the diagnostic codes listed in Table 1 some time after their admission. Normalizing the distributions in Fig. 3 by the total counts in the diagnostic category yields the estimated probability densities in Fig. 4 ; these densities are normalized, and shown, on a 30 day timescale rather than the 100 day timescale presented in Fig. 3 (in order to focus on pairs of events that are more likely to be causally connected). The leveling-off of the influenza distribution at a higher value than the pneumonia and other respiratory diagnoses in most of the plots (admission to discharge, admission to mortality) is an artifact of the smaller number of influenza cases; if the total number of cases is 10,000, then the non-zero values of the distribution cannot go below 10 \u22124 . Figure 5 summarizes and facilitates comparison of the various delay distributions. Delays corresponding to the 2.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 97.5% quantiles are interpolated from the cumulative delay distributions.",

We also fitted four-component finite mixtures of Poisson distributions; with 7 parameters (four rate parameters and three parameters determining the relative weights of the mixture components) these captured much more of the overall pattern, but still left some features unexplained. Other models, such as a finite mixture of negative binomial distributions, may provide better summaries; how complex a summary is most useful (e.g. a simple Gamma vs. a many-parameter finite mixture) will depend on particular applications.

Fortuitously, the data years available to us included the 2009 influenza pandemic, so we were also able to compare distributions in non-pandemic years with a pandemic year. Furthermore, we were able to compare various outcome probabilities given specific events (P&I diagnosis, hospitalization, and death) during different years. We emphasize that these conditional probabilities reflect associations, not causal links. Neverthless, they are useful for identifying patterns in the data that may be valuable to explore more thoroughly in the future. For example, we found that the probability of hospitalization for an individual who was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the pandemic year was, surprisingly, lower than in nonpandemic years; mortality in hospital was roughly the same for both pandemic and non-pandemic years.",

For example, approximately 5% of people admitted to hospital died there, and if they died in hospital then the probability that they had been diagnosed with influenza or pneumonia within the year was 10%.",
