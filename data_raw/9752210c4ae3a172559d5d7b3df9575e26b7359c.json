Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza H5N1 prompted development of pandemic preparedness plans. National systems of public health law are essential for public health stewardship and for the implementation of public health policy [1] . International coherence will contribute to effective regional and global responses. However little research has been undertaken on how law works as a tool for disease control in Europe. With co-funding from the European Union, we investigated the extent to which laws across Europe support or constrain pandemic preparedness planning, and whether national differences are likely to constrain control efforts.",

There is insufficient understanding across Europe of the role and importance of law in pandemic planning. States need to build capacity in public health law to support disease prevention and control policies. Our research suggests that states would welcome further guidance from the EU on management of a pandemic, and guidance to assist in greater commonality of legal approaches across states.",

SARS and the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 galvanized political and public health communities to strengthen international, national and local preparedness and response capacities, and the emergence of H1N1 influenza has tested those responses. The International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) represent an important international commitment to strengthening global capacity and acknowledge that law is part of the public health armamentarium underpinning cooperative national and international responses [2] . Whilst global disease surveillance capacity, in particular, has been considerably strengthened through the IHR, management of disease outbreaks, including pandemics, remains grounded in notions of national sovereignty. The same can be noted with regard to European co-operation, where regulations concerning surveillance and early warning are drafted with full respect for domestic law [3] [4] [5] [6] . Harmonization of public health laws is not considered to be within the competence of the EU [7] . National systems of public health law are essential for influenza pandemic control, and international coherence will contribute to effective regional and global responses [1] .",

The persons who completed the questionnaire were in all cases except one, the persons who attended the review workshops. Workshops Four workshops were held (London, Toulouse, Prague and Lisbon), with a participant from each state attending one workshop. Building upon information provided through the questionnaires, we explored how national state laws might assist or constrain public health interventions in the context of the influenza pandemic scenarios previously described through the survey instrument and also, with the emergence and global spread of H1N1v in early 2009, how contemporary national responses were impacted by current national laws. Respondents then analysed how differences between national legal systems and between specific laws might support or hinder regional responses to pandemic influenza, and the impact of national laws in the following areas:",

In some states such as Belgium and France, however, there are general powers enabling any proportionate measure for a public health purpose. In other states, such as Ireland, there is a broad power to make regulations to prevent the spread of infectious disease and to treat people suffering from infectious disease that could authorise measures such as compulsory examination and treatment. Examples of proposed pandemic measures not supported by law included the use of unlicensed drugs, vaccines and health workers, closure of borders, control of media information and reporting, obligation of workers to work where there was risk to health and safety, compulsory isolation, quarantine, vaccination and prioritisation of people in access to vaccines and antivirals. Plans of some states, for example Estonia, recognised the need to ensure a legal framework for measures while plans of most states made no mention of legal underpinning.",

Several participants identified problems arising from a lack of expertise in public health law in their state, inhibiting implementation of pandemic planning.

While some states' laws authorise compulsory vaccination and treatment, other states' laws prevent vaccination or treatment without consent.

Only in two states were lines of command thought to be clear, coordinated and detailed. One role of law is to provide an inviolable framework for policy and the application of powers. Where pandemic plans have been prepared independently, and in ignorance or neglectful, of law, and where the legal framework has not been updated to reflect plans, then confusion is inevitable. A common theme in workshop discussions was the lack of clarity within states and across states as to the authority responsible for the management of different aspects of disease control. Authorities in one state are not always clear which body is their equivalent in other states, and whom to contact. This is a particular problem in states where powers are devolved to regional or local levels. For example in Sweden, where the system is decentralised and law places responsibility at regional/local level, there are 21 regional preparedness plans with their own responsible public health bodies. Further work needs to be undertaken on making clear pandemic responsibilities and competences. This is an issue of concern, given the lead-in time we have been given for a pandemic resulting from SARS and avian influenza H5N1. It is hoped that the H1N1v pandemic, a pandemic associated with limited morbidity and mortality, will provide an opportunity to establish responsibilities and hierarchies in management.",

In some cases attempts have been made to amend laws in recognition of IHR obligations and pandemic planning, without addressing the outdated science and jurisprudence that underlay old legislation, resulting in an inaccessible collection of uncoordinated and unconsolidated laws. Lack of public health legal expertise across Europe compounds this inaccessibility. While rapporteurs reported an intention by their states to make national laws compliant with the IHR by 2012, there appears to be insufficient understanding in many states of the role of the IHR, of what is required in the way of compliance in Annex 1 of the IHR and of the relationship of the IHR to state plans and laws, despite guidance on legislative compliance provided by the WHO[15]. Our results suggest that lack of understanding of laws by persons working in public health has contributed to lack of coherence between the IHR, plans and laws in some states. As has been noted elsewhere[16] the IHR (2005) like its predecessor regulations, relies on nonbinding recommendations and guidance ('soft law') rather than on legal obligations, such that compliance by signatory states cannot be assured.",

In some states disease measures are clearly specified in advance, and in others measures are to be determined where the need arises. States differ in the range and the nature of intervention measures authorized by law, the extent to which borders will be closed to movement of persons and goods during a pandemic, and access to healthcare of non-resident persons. Some states propose use of emergency powers that might potentially override human rights protections while other states propose to limit interventions to those authorized by public health laws. These differences could create a problem for European strategies.",

The results of our research suggest that states would welcome further guidance from the EU on management of a pandemic, and guidance to assist in greater commonality of legal approaches across states. There will be ramifications of incoherence of laws across states for movement of populations, transportation of drugs, access to healthcare and for human rights and data protection. There is a need for further analyses to determine the public health implications of differences in laws, and whether regions beyond Europe are more coherent in their legal responses to pandemic influenza.",
