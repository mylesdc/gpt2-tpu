A range of compounds currently available with broad antimicrobial activity have been tested for activity against EBOV. Using live EBOV, eighteen candidate compounds were screened for antiviral activity in vitro. The compounds were selected on a rational basis because their mechanisms of action suggested that they had the potential to disrupt EBOV entry, replication or exit from cells or because they had displayed some antiviral activity against EBOV in previous tests. Nine compounds caused no reduction in viral replication despite cells remaining healthy, so they were excluded from further analysis (zidovudine; didanosine; stavudine; abacavir sulphate; entecavir; JB1a; Aimspro; celgosivir; and castanospermine). A second screen of the remaining compounds and the feasibility of appropriateness for in vivo testing removed six further compounds (ouabain; omeprazole; esomeprazole; Gleevec; D-LANA-14; and Tasigna). The three most promising compounds (17-DMAG; BGB324; and NCK-8) were further screened for in vivo activity in the guinea pig model of EBOV disease. Two of the compounds, BGB324 and NCK-8, showed some effect against lethal infection in vivo at the concentrations tested, which warrants further investigation. Further, these data add to the body of knowledge on the antiviral activities of multiple compounds against EBOV and indicate that the scientific community should invest more effort into the development of novel and specific antiviral compounds to treat Ebola virus disease.",

Ebola virus is the prototype species [1, 2] (formally designated Zaire ebolavirus) and was responsible for the large outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in parts of West Africa first recognized in December 2013 [3] . EBOV is the most virulent species of the family with a case mortality of up to 90%, whereas the Reston species is virtually non-pathogenic in humans [4] . In response to the outbreak in West Africa and the threat of further outbreaks in the absence of approved and proven therapeutics or vaccines, there has been increased international, political, humanitarian and scientific momentum to identify treatment strategies. In this context, during the 2013/2014 EBOV outbreak, Public Health England (PHE) was approached by several academic and commercial entities requesting rapid evaluation of repurposed drugs and experimental therapies for EBOV, using its Containment Level 4 (CL4) facilities. With support from the Ebola research funding initiative from the Wellcome Trust, a project to determine the viable drug candidates for further development was developed. The eighteen candidates in this report were selected from sixty credible leads by a scientific panel; they covered a range of potentially promising mechanisms of action against EBOV. Brief details of the compounds nominated for inclusion are outlined below:",

Both compounds were shown to inhibit lentivirus-based pseudotypes expressing EBOV glycoprotein [10] \u2022 Gleevec and Tasigna (market names for imatinib mesylate and nilotinib, respectively): Specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors originally developed as anticancer compounds and proposed to inhibit phosphorylation of the VP40 matrix protein which is required for EBOV exit from cells [11] . During large-scale screens of antivirals against EBOV, other groups have identified Gleevec [12] and Tasigna [13] as potential EBOV inhibitors \u2022 Aimspro (anti-inflammatory immuno-suppressive drug): Originally developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by the production of hyperimmune serum in goats injected with inactivated HIV IIIB, the serum has revealed the presence of a range of components, including the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, proopiomelanocortin, arginine vasopressin, \u03b2-endorphin and corticotropin-releasing factor [14] \u2022 NCK-8 and D-LANA-14: Small molecules that mimic the properties of antimicrobial peptides, NCK-8 [15, 16] and D-LANA-14 [17] have demonstrated potent activity against drug-resistant bacteria and their biofilms. The activity of this class of compounds is attributed to their membrane disrupting properties [18] [19] [20] . Peptide mimics [21] and several other small molecules have demonstrated activity against EBOV. Owing to the membrane-disrupting [22, 23] [6] and VeroE6 for being widely used in EBOV studies [25] [26] [27] . Compounds were sourced commercially (Selleck Chemicals, Boston, MA, USA; and Dalton Pharm Services, Toronto, ON, Canada) wherever possible or directly from the supplier if they were not readily available (BGB324, BerGenBio, Bergen, Norway; JB1a, Avipero, Edinburgh, UK; Aimspro, Daval International, Eastbourne, UK). NCK-8 and D-LANA-14 were synthesized and characterized in Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, India. Stock solutions of these compounds were made at double the final dilution to take into account an equal volume of virus suspension to be added. Several stocks were supplied in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. After dilution, the highest concentration of DMSO was \u22640.05%, except for omeprazole and esomeprazole, where the highest concentrations were 10% and 7.5%, respectively.",

Vascular catheters were inserted prior to arrival to allow safe access to the intravenous route of delivery at CL4. Animals were challenged via the subcutaneous route with a dose of 10 3 TCID 50 guinea pig-adapted EBOV that had been passaged five times in vivo [31] . The challenge preparation was back titrated in VeroE6 cells to confirm the dose. At 6 h post-challenge, treatment was initiated with the compounds BGB324, NCK-8 and 17-DMAG. BGB324 was dissolved in 0.5% (w/w) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/0.1% (w/w) Tween-80 to give a concentration that equated to 100 mg/kg in 1 mL. Doses of 1 mL were given orally twice daily.

Doses were delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and scheduled for every other day. A negative control group consisted of guinea pigs that were EBOV challenged, but received no treatment.

            "text": "The recent outbreak of EBOV disease in West Africa [3] has highlighted the urgent need for therapeutics. These needs might be met most quickly and efficiently if an existing drug with a known safety profile could be repurposed to treat EBOV effectively. Our study screened eighteen theoretically-promising antiviral therapies against EBOV using in vitro and in vivo experiments with live virus at CL4. Given the seriousness and long running extent of the West African EVD outbreak, we developed an experimental workflow to rapidly screen compounds for antiviral activity in order to focus efforts and resources on only the most promising therapies. In the first in vitro screen using 500 TCID 50 /well (multiplicity of infection (MOI) approximately 0.01), half of the compounds failed to show any activity, so these compounds were excluded from further study. For a second screen using 5000 TCID 50 /well (MOI approximately 0.1), eight of the remaining nine compounds continued to demonstrate a mean reduction in viral replication. In this screen, the drug Tasigna was not retested due to compound unavailability, but additionally, the drug Gleevec was included since it was reported to operate via the same mechanism and demonstrated better in vitro efficacy. The in vitro screens used viral RNA levels as a readout based on previous antiviral testing work [33] and infectious doses of MOI 0.01-0.1, similar to levels used in other anti-EBOV testing studies [6, 34, 35] . Given that the compounds tested in our study were chosen due to their perceived potential effectiveness for use against EBOV, the negative results demonstrate the importance of testing therapies using the actual live pathogen to determine effects. They also highlight the uncertainties inherent in extrapolating the mechanism of action data to drug repurposing, no matter how rational.",

            "text": "Of the eight compounds that showed repeatable antiviral activity against EBOV in vitro, three were selected for in vivo studies using the guinea pig model of infection (i.e., 17-DMAG, BGB324 and NCK-8). Whereas omeprazole and esomeprazole demonstrated in vitro activity against EBOV, the results were in line with a previous report using pseudotyped viruses where the values of drug concentration causing 50% inhibition (IC 50 ) were in the region of 50 \u00b5M [10] . This suggested that doses required for potent inhibition would be difficult to achieve without concomitant and significant toxicity (the licenced dosing for 40 mg esomeprazole, 20 mg esomeprazole and 20 mg omeprazole generates median maximum plasma concentrations of 1.59-9.61 \u00b5M, 0.51-4.78 \u00b5M and 0.15-3.51 \u00b5M, respectively [36] ). Gleevec (brand name for imatinib mesylate) was not followed through for in vivo testing since the optimal dosing requirement (i.e., continuous dosing) was not feasible for the current set-up of the animal model at CL4. The requirement for continuous dosing is due to the short half-life in rats of a similar compound [37] . Additionally, the plasma concentrations of Gleevec usually reach 2-3 \u00b5M at normal dosages [38] . Others have suggested that the concentration for effective EBOV inhibition is 20 \u00b5M [11] , which would not be possible. However, the data from the in vitro studies with live EBOV reported here show effects even when 0.74 \u00b5M was used. NCK-8 and D-LANA-14 are membrane-active small molecules that mimic the properties of natural antimicrobial peptides and may negatively impact the viral envelope and cellular lipid bilayer. Out of the two molecules, D-LANA-14, was less active; hence its efficacy was not assessed in the animal model. The guinea pig model of EBOV disease was used in this work since it presents a robust, accessible and broadly reflective rodent model for the screening of countermeasures [39] . Importantly, the model also allows catheterized animals to be used, allowing direct access to the intravenous route. This is the preferred route of delivery for many antiviral compounds and is compatible for work at the highest microbiological containment [30] .",

However, the survivor in the BGB324-treated group did not show the significant loss in weight that is typical of EBOV-infected guinea pigs [31] and that was exhibited by the survivor in the untreated group. Both surviving guinea pigs exhibited an increase in temperature typical of EBOV infection in this model [31] . It is possible that these observations are a consequence of broad guinea pig responses, since these animals were outbred individuals and there were subtle differences between their responses. The effects of BGB324 were proposed to be due to the inhibition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors [40] . Thus, it could be speculated that other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including the two in this study (Gleevec and Tasigna), would also not have demonstrated protective effects.",

All animals treated with NCK-8 exhibited weight loss and temperature increases, in line with the levels of untreated animals. Interestingly, this class of compounds has been tested against bacterial pathogens [15, 19, 41] and has been found to be quite effective. Other peptide mimics have demonstrated antiviral activity against EBOV, as well [21] . However, it should be noted that although NCK-8 showed high levels of antiviral activity, the cell monolayers were phenotypically different for both VeroE6 and MRC-5 cell lines. This observation warrants further investigation, especially the dependence of activity on the concentration of the compounds. Nevertheless, NCK-8 was well-tolerated when tested in guinea pigs and led to the recovery of one animal from EBOV infection.",

Therefore, it is likely that there is a non-compatible interaction with a component of guinea pig physiology that results in a toxic effect. To further test the effectiveness of 17-DMAG against EBOV, an animal system where the compound has shown to be non-toxic should be used, such as the mouse. However, due to the mouse model not being as relevant to human disease as the guinea pig [43] , the value of conducting such studies may be counterproductive.",

Candidates for this study were chosen via a project-specific selection committee (comprising of members from PHE, academia and the Wellcome Trust), not by screening approaches of a large number of compounds [12, 44, 45] , so were more selective based on perceived activity against EBOV.
