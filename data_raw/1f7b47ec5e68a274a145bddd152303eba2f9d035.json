After less than three months, 182 countries were affected by the pandemic accounting for about 150,000 infected cases and 3000 mortality. Successful H1N1 pandemic management strategies' shaped by making changes in health behavior. The aim of this study was to document patients' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and its prevention. We performed a cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) on preventive measures of Influenza A (H1N1) involving 322 patients attending Klinik Kesihatan Jinjang, a primary health care clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from May 10 to 26, 2010 using a face to face interview with a structured pre-tested questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were females (56.8%), Malays (43.2%) aged between 18-27 years old (28.9%). There were significant association between knowledge on the complication of H1N1, effectiveness of the treatment, preventive measures of Influenza A (H1N1) and race (p<0.001) and educational level (p<0.001). There were also significant associations between attitude scores of these patients and their gender (p=0.03), and educational level (p=0.001). Practice scores related to H1N1 were found to be significantly associated with race (p<0.001) and educational level (p<0.001). The significant associations were observed between knowledge and attitude (p<0.001), knowledge and practices (p<0.001), as well as attitude and practices related to H1N1 (p<0.001). Knowledge has a crucial effect on patients' attitude and practice particularly in a pandemic spread. So health policy makers should attempt to disseminate information about preventive measures to community in order to improve their preventive practices during pandemics.",

            "text": "across the globe with substantial clinical impact (WHO, 2009) . During the first wave of A (H1N1) influenza in Malaysia, 14,912 cases were reported from May 15, 2009 until Jun 4, 2010 and a total number of 88 deaths were recorded across the country in 2010 (Ministry of Health Malaysia; 2010) . Effective pandemic management requires support from the population at risk for measures undertaken to mitigate the pandemic's spread. Previous studies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 have shown that individual beliefs and perceptions play an important role in subsequent desired behavioral change (Tang and Wong, 2003; Lau et al., 2003) . Higher perception on effectiveness of measures undertaken (Lau et al., 2003; Tang and Wong, 2004) and higher perceived threat of the disease led to higher rates of positive behavioral change, and better knowledge also increased the uptake of preventive measures (Leung et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2005) . Similarly, in an anticipated H5N1 epidemic, these factors also influenced both self and community protective behavior (Lau et al., 2007) During the current influenza pandemic, studies have found that the individual's emotional status mediates behavioral response (Jones and Salathe, 2009) ) and that perceived severity and susceptibility to disease and perceived effectiveness of specific behaviors resulted in the corresponding recommended behavior changes (Rubin et al., 2009; Seale et al., 2009) . To increase positive perceptions, clear dissemination of information is vital to reduce misconceptions (Lau et al., 2009) . It is therefore important to perform behavioral studies in different populations to understand the determinants that influence behaviors. However, there have been few studies (Mohd Shahriman et al., 2009; Zairina et al., 2011) on the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the influenza A pandemic in Malaysia. As such, there is a need to understand the factors influencing such behavioral changes to promote effective management of influenza A pandemics in this country. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associated with complications of H1N1, effectiveness of treatment, preventive measures and health promotion of Influenza A (H1N1) among patients attending Klinik Kesihatan Jinjang in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2010.",

The questionnaire was consisted of 4 parts: A: demographic characteristics, B: knowledge C: attitudes and D: practices of participants using both open and close questions. The questionnaire collected information on basic demographic data on age, sex, ethnicity and education level as well as questions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices on pandemic influenza A (H1N1). Questions on knowledge were used to assess the respondent's general knowledge on pandemic influenza A and on the recommended preventive measures. Questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions towards pandemic influenza A and these preventive measures. Questions on practices were used to assess the actual compliance and practices of these measures. Respondents' were asked to rate their agreement with the statements in the questionnaire, which were scored either yes/no or on a 4 point Likert scale.",

This concurred with the findings of Wisedjinda (2009) and Zairina et al., (2011) confirming a significant association between attitude and practices. This study has some limitation as the study population was only confined to adults and limited in one health centre which its generalizability is questionable. Although results in this study are useful in pandemic preparedness, the community response may change over time as compared to the time of study.
