AVI-7288, a positively charged antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMOplus) targeting the viral nucleoprotein gene, was evaluated as a potential therapeutic intervention for MARV infection following delayed treatment of 1, 24, 48, and 96 h post-infection (PI) in a nonhuman primate lethal challenge model. A total of 30 cynomolgus macaques were divided into 5 groups of 6 and infected with 1,830 plaque forming units of MARV subcutaneously. AVI-7288 was administered by bolus infusion daily for 14 days at 15 mg/kg body weight. Survival was the primary endpoint of the study. While none (0 of 6) of the saline group survived, 83-100% of infected monkeys survived when treatment was initiated 1, 24, 48, or 96 h post-infection (PI). The antisense treatment also reduced serum viremia and inflammatory cytokines in all treatment groups compared to vehicle controls. The antibody immune response to virus was preserved and tissue viral antigen was cleared in AVI-7288 treated animals. These data show that AVI-7288 protects NHPs against an otherwise lethal MARV infection when treatment is initiated up to 96 h PI.",

In humans, Marburg virus disease (MVD) typically begins with high fever accompanied by a severe headache, chills, myalgia and malaise. For many patients, this is followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. After about 5 days, more than 75% of the patients develop some form of hemorrhagic manifestation such as mucosal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis, and ecchymosis [2] . Later stages of the disease can manifest in multiorgan failure, shock, and coma. Acute liver failure, with concomitant increases in liver-associated enzymes, is a common disease manifestation [3] . Case fatality rates can approach 90%, with death typically occurring 8-16 days following the onset of symptoms [1, 2] .",

These genes and their products represent potential targets for the development of therapeutic agents. There are currently no licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for MARV infection, although several approaches are actively being pursued for postexposure therapeutic interventions. Daddario-DiCaprio et al. showed the first complete postexposure protection of nonhuman primates against MARV infection using a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector expressing the MARV GP [4] . However, the construct was given just 20-30 min after viral challenge and safety and efficacy of this therapeutic modality in human subjects remains unproven. Postexposure administration of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2, a strategy designed to mitigate coagulopathy seen in severe MARV infections, failed to provide substantive protection of infected monkeys [5] . Recent studies using liposome formulated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the NP gene of MARV in guinea pig and nonhuman primate models are promising [6, 7] . In addition, studies have demonstrated the importance of the MARV NP gene in both viral assembly [8] and viral RNA synthesis [9] , highlighting the critical role the NP gene plays in the life cycle of the MARV.",

            "text": "Antisense oligomers, such as AVI-7288, are synthetic molecules designed to interfere with the translation of gene products by sterically blocking mRNA resulting in the inhibition of gene expression [10] . AVI-7288 is designed to prevent viral replication by binding to NP mRNA in a sequence-specific manner, thus sterically blocking translation. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are uncharged antisense compounds composed of moieties with 6-sided morpholino bases linked by phosphorodiamidate linkages, as opposed to a ribose base as in RNA, linked through methylene phosphorodiamidate. PMOs are attractive as antiviral agents due to their metabolic stability, and bioavailability [11, 12] . PMOs and peptideconjugated PMOs (PPMO) have been shown to inhibit the replication of Ebola virus [13, 14] , coxsackievirus B3 [15] , influenza A virus [16, 17] , alphaviruses [18] , vesiviruses [19] , dengue virus [20] , and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [21] . In a previous report, we introduced a new class of positively-charged PMO (PMOplus) containing piperazine linkages within the molecular backbone and containing a limited number (between 2 and 5) of positive charges [14] . The positive charges may enhance both cellular penetration and avidity to the negatively charged RNA target sequence of the virus. We previously showed that administration of PMOplus, in a combination therapy containing antisense agents targeting NP and VP24 of MARV, provided 100% protection of cynomolgus macaques when given 30-60 min after infection [22] . Subsequently, we showed that a single agent designated AVI-7288, targeting the NP of MARV, was as effective as the combination therapy [23] . In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of AVI-7288 alone in cynomolgus macaques in a delayed timeto-treatment study in which the PMOplus was administered 1, 24, 48, or 96 h following infection with MARV.",

Animals were sedated for blood collection procedures using ketamine (100 mg/mL)/acepromazine (10 mg/mL) at 0.1 mL/kg administered intramuscularly. Four days before viral challenge, a blood sample was collected for determination of \"baseline\" values for each animal's serum chemistry values, hematology, and coagulation parameters. The macaques were randomized into five groups with six animals (including at least one female) in each group. Animals were challenged with 1,830 plaque forming units (PFU) of MARV Musoke by subcutaneous injection. AVI-7288 was administered once daily for 14 d by bolus IV injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg beginning approximately 1, 24, 48, or 96 h after virus challenge. An infection-control group received IV saline (0.9% NaCl) according to the same regimen as AVI-7288, beginning 1 h after challenge. Table 1 summarizes the animal groupings and treatment regimens.

One saline-treated monkey died on day 9 and all the animals in this control group succumbed by day 11 PI (Fig 1) after developing characteristic MVD signs such as fever and petechial rash. In contrast, 83% (five of six) of the monkeys in the 1, 24, and 96 h PI treatment groups survived. All of the monkeys (six of six) in the 48 h PI treatment group survived (Fig 1) . Although the death of the one animal that died in the 1 h PI treatment group was attributed to complications associated with anesthesia administration, and there were only mild signs of MVD in this monkey, this mortality was treated as a treatment failure and was included in the survival statistics. The differences in survival between the PBS-and AVI-7288-treated groups were highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001), while the differences in survival between groups receiving AVI-7288 treatments were statistically indistinguishable. No significant differences were observed in animal body temperature or weight during the course of the study (S1 ",

A recent report demonstrated post-exposure treatment protection of rhesus monkeys from MARV-Angola strain with treatment delay up to 3 days [7] . AVI-7288 has previously been shown to be highly effective in providing survival benefit in cynomolgus macaques infected with the Musoke strain of MARV, however, the PMOplus therapy in these experimental studies began on the day of infection [23] . In contrast, a treatment regimen for infected humans would usually need to be initiated in a longer post infection time period. Hence, it is important to determine the potential benefit of AVI-7288 when initiation of treatment is significantly delayed after infection. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine the survival benefit provided by AVI-7288 when initially administered up to four days after infection with the Musoke strain of MARV, utilizing the cynomolgus macaque animal model.",

The difference in survival rate between the control groups and the treated animals was highly significant. Furthermore, differences in survival between groups receiving AVI-7288 treatments at different times PI were not statistically distinguishable. Two of the three AVI-7288 treated animals (0197 in the 24 h group and 9172 in the 96 h group) that succumbed to infection were slow to mount an IgG immune response (1:30 and 1:270 titers, respectively). However, a low IgG titer was not adequate to provide a reliable marker of survival as several of the survivors had low IgG titers on day 14 PI. There was no notable relationship between the magnitude or duration of the MARV-specific IgG response and the time of AVI-7288 dosing or macaque survival. Overall, the results of this study indicate that, when administered IV once per day for a total of 14 days, AVI-7288 protects cynomolgus macaques against MARV even when the treatments are initiated as late as 96 h after viral infection.",

            "text": "Of the 21 treated macaques that survived the viral challenge, IHC revealed the presence of MARV antigen in organs of nine animals. One monkey had faint staining for viral antigen in macrophages within foci of inflammation in the thyroid gland. Although it is possible that this is an indication of persistent viral infection in the thyroid, it is more likely that these macrophages contain viral antigen due to phagocytosis of cellular debris containing viral antigen. Similarly, another animal had viral antigen in acellular debris within a tonsillar crypt. This probably reflects persistence of isolated viral antigen rather than the presence of intact, viable viral particles. However, eight of the male monkeys had testicular lesions with positive viral antigen in the foci of testicular inflammation; this might indicate that these macaques had persistent MARV infections at the time of their deaths. This is consistent with findings in humans who died of MARV during the original 1967 outbreak in which autopsy revealed large necrotic lesions in the testicles [29] . Furthermore, a man who survived MARV infection during this outbreak is believed to have infected his wife via sexual contact more than 6 weeks after his clinical recovery and viable MARV was subsequently recovered from his seminal samples as late as 16 weeks after his discharge from the hospital [30] . The possibility of venereal transmission may not be confined to MARV; a household contact of an Ebola patient from the 1995 Kikwit outbreak was presumably infected by sexual intercourse and four out of five convalescent patients examined had seminal fluid samples that were PCR positive for Ebola virus [29] . Given the on-going large Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, sexual transmission of the virus is a concern [31] . Interestingly, although eight of the survivor male macaques in this study had MARV antigen in their testicular lesions, none of these tissues yielded viable virus by plaque assay suggesting that the treatment suppressed viral replication in the animals' testes. Additional research needs to be done to clarify the potential for viral persistence in the testis.",

We demonstrated the efficacy of this compound administered up to four days after infection with MARV in a cynomolgus macaque animal model. It should be noted that infected animals first became PCR positive on day 5 and first showed clinical signs of disease on day 8 post infection. Administration of AVI-7288 resulted in marked improvement in survival and amelioration of laboratory and pathological manifestations of MARV disease. The current Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa reminds us of the need to identify effective antiviral products in advance of such emergency situations. As such, this is an area of filovirus therapeutics development that deserves further study, particularly to further define the limits of when treatment can be successfully initiated. Furthermore, AVI-7288 has recently been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in humans [32] and should be further developed as an effective MARV therapeutic. ",

A) Average daily rectal temperature (\u00b0F) of macaques in the saline treatment group (filled circles; red line) and the 1 h post-infection treatment group (open circles; blue line). Fever was first observed on day 6 post-challenge. B) Changes in average daily body weight of macaques in the saline group (filled circles; red line) and the 1 h post-challenge treatment group (open circles; blue line). (TIF) S2 Fig. Responsiveness scores. Changes in responsiveness scores obtained from individual animal observations (the average of two observations per day) for the saline treatment group (filled black circles) and macaques that succumbed (open circles). The scoring parameters were: 0: active; 1: mild behavioral depression; 2: moderate behavioral depression; 3: head down, hunched; 4: severe behavioral depression; 5: moribund and nonresponsive. The earliest observation of a change in responsiveness was seen on day 8 post challenge. (TIF) S3 Fig. Serum viremia (genome copies/mL) over time. Mean serum virus genome equivalents per mL serum was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The dotted line represents the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.33 x 10 5 genome equivalents/mL. (TIF) S4 Fig. Serum viremia (genome copies/mL) for individual macaques for days 4 through 8 post challenge. Each animal is represented by filled circles for AVI-7288 treatment groups and open circles for the saline treatment group. The dotted line represents the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.33 x 10 5 genome equivalents/mL. No animals had quantifiable viral genome copies on day 4 post challenge, but all animals had quantifiable viral genome copies on day 8 post challenge. Most, but not all animals, first presented with quantifiable viral genome copies on day 5 post challenge. (TIF) S5 Fig. Viral load in tissues. Tissue viral load of macaques exposed to MARV and treated with saline or AVI-7288 at 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 96 h post challenge. (TIF) S6 Fig. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Analysis of serum ALT levels for macaques on day 8 post challenge. (TIF) S7 Fig. Serum bilirubin. Analysis of serum bilirubin levels for macaques on day 8 post challenge. (TIF) S8 Fig. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Analysis of serum (A) ALP and (B) GGT levels in macaques treated with AVI-7288 96 h post challenge. Since all the animals in the saline treatment group succumbed to infection after day 10, animals in the 1 h treatment group were included for comparison. (TIF) S9 Fig. Platelets and MPV. Analysis of (A) platelets and (B) MPV from macaques in all treatment groups on day 8 and day 10, respectively, post challenge. (TIF) S10 Fig. Coagulation. Analysis of serum (A) activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and (B) prothrombin time (PT) over the course of the study. Since all the animals in the saline treatment group succumbed to infection after day 10, results from the 1 h and 96 h treatment groups were compared. (TIF) S11 Fig. Cytokines. Analysis of the cytokines (A) IL-6, (B) MDC, (C) MIP-1\u03b2, and (D) TARC from macaques in all treatment groups on day 8 post challenge. (TIF)",
