Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system-and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii.",

The organism is frequently pandrug-resistant and capable of causing substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with severe underlying diseases, both in the hospital and in the community [1] . Rapid identification of this pathogen is critical for the appropriate therapy and outbreak control. Conventional methods, such as a phenotypic system and commercial phenotypic method, have successfully identified most Acinetobacter species. However, these methods can not distinguish Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU, and require specific media and several days of incubation [2] . DNA-based methods have been successfully applied in the detection of A. baumannii [3, 4] . However, these methods have been hampered by inconsistent results with culture-based methods. Moreover, most protocols developed for identification of A. baumannii by PCR have used primers complementary to a universal region found in several different bacterial genera, so that DNA from bacteria belonging to other genera might also be amplified [2, 5] . However, as progress is made towards better outbreak control, more sensitive tools will be required in order to detect low level of A. baumannii. Therefore, further efforts are needed to develop next generation molecular tools for field use with a goal that such tools can complement, or in some situations, replace the existing molecular methods for A. baumannii detection.",

The method has been used to detect different humaninfecting plasmodium species [14] . This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp). In this study, we demonstrated the utility of this method for the detection of A. baumannii and distinguishing A. baumannii from Acinetobacter genomic species 3, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus by using species-specific primers and comparing it to an automated identification system VITEK 2 system and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The VITEK 2 system uses a fluorescencebased technology for routine identification of gram-negative bacteria [15] . A. baumannii ATCC19606, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter genomic species 3, Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU and clinical samples A. baumannii ATCC19606 was kindly provided by Wang [16] . Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU were kindly provided by Zhou et al. [17] . A. baumannii ATCC19606, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth at 37uC. Pure genomic DNA was extracted from A. baumannii ATCC19606 using a TaKaRa MiniBEST Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.2.0 (TaKaRa Code: DV810A), and the genomic DNA was subjected to serial 10-fold dilutions in sterilized distilled water to produce concentrations ranging from 100 ng/mL to 1 pg/mL and assess the correlation between time to amplification and amount of target DNA. In addition, the number of colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) was determined by using plate count. To test the limits of detection of RealAmp, overnight cultures were serially diluted (ten-fold) in Luria-Bertani broth from starting inocula of 1610 7 CFU/mL to 10 1 CFU/mL before DNA extraction. In addition, to evaluate the specificity of RealAmp, DNA extracts from the array of bacterial species were tested (Table 1) . One hundred and sixtytwo spontaneous early-morning sputa from patients evaluated using light microscopy (WBC $25 and epithelia cells ,10 per 1006field) were qualified. Ninety sputum samples identified as A. baumannii positive and 72 sputum samples as A. baumannii negative by VITEK 2 system (BioM\u00e9rieux Inc, France), were used to assess the RealAmp assay. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A. baumannii ATCC19606 DNA was used as a positive control. Blood sample DNA from healthy individual was used as a negative control. Each of the molecular tests was carried out and interpreted by independent researchers blinded to the origin of the specimens and the laboratory results. Samples with discrepant results in the 2 tests were retested.",

The primers forward outer primer (F3), backward outer primer (B3), forward internal primer (FIP), backward internal primer (BIP) and loop backward primer (LB) listed in Table 2 for the RealAmp test were designed by targeting the conserved regions of the pgaD gene of A. baumannii (GeneBank accession numbers: FJ866500, CP003856, CP003500, CP001937, CP002522, CP001921, CP000863, CP001172, CP001182, CU459141, CP000521, NZ_GG704572). The target selection for primer design can be accomplished by using the Primer Explorer (http://Primer Explorer.jp/e/v4_manual/In. dex.html). The primer specificity was checked using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) against human DNA and other Acinetobacter sequences in the nonredundant GenBank database.",

Forty microliters of sterilized distilled water was added to the tube containing the precipitate and mixed. The tube was heated on a heat-block at 100uC for 15 minutes, and then placed on ice for 10 minutes. Finally, the tube was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatants were collected and used in the RealAmp and PCR assays.",

However, multiplex PCR can pose several difficulties, including poor sensitivity or specificity and/or preferential amplification of certain specific targets. The presence of more than one primer pair in the multiplex PCR increases the chance of obtaining spurious amplification products, primarily because of the formation of primer dimers [20, 22] . Real-time PCR assay have many advantages over conventional PCR, including rapidity, lower contamination rate, higher sensitivity and easy standardization.

The RealAmp test does not require time-consuming steps for DNA purification, or downstream processing for amplicon detection. More importantly, the interpretation of results from this closed-tube test does not require highly experienced staff. A small LCD panel is available to display the results (as positive or negative). These features make the RealAmp assay an excellent option for the molecular test of A. baumannii even in basic healthcare settings. However, the disadvantage of the device is that it can accommodate only eight samples once and uses nonspecific dye [24] . Therefore, modification is required to expand the device to accommodate more samples.",

To our knowledge, A. calcoaceticus is an environmental organism, which has never been involved in serious human disease, and therefore it should not be misidentified as A. baumannii [26] . The natural habitats of A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU are unknown, as are the differences in their epidemic behaviors, resistance mechanisms, and pathogenicities. Acinetobacter genomic species 3 can be found regularly on human skin, as well as in aquatic environments [27] . Acinetobacter genomic species 3 has also been implicated in nosocomial infections, but its tendency for epidemic spread and resistance development is far less obvious than that of A. baumannii [27] . For epidemiological and clinical purposes, it is very critical to differentiate among these species correctly. In our study, the species-specific primers were designed to distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. However, the previously reported LAMP test based on A. baumannii targeting the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer sequence could not effectively distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU [13] .",

Moreover, the slower rate of metabolism of A. baumannii could cause weaker fluorescent biochemical reactions in the reaction wells of VITEK 2 ID-GNB cards, and this may cause more discrepant identifications with the VITEK 2 system [28] . Joyanes et al. [15] found that the VITEK 2 system identified 91.6%, 100%, and 76% of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and A. baumannii isolates, within 3 h. However, the RealAmp assay could detect A. baumannii isolates which would not be affected by biochemical reactions. In addition, for the RealAmp assay, the targets for detection are representative sequences from the pathogens, alive or dead. Culture-based assays, on the other hand, detect all living bacterial cells grown in the culture media. Table 3 . Sensitivity and Specificity of the RealAmp assay compared to VITEK 2 system and PCR assay. VITEK To be objective, there are more elements and factors to be considered when culture-based assays are performed, such as how to keep the cells alive and what selective media to use for visualizing the colonies. The RealAmp method will be more attractive for field use if the LAMP reagents can be made into dry powder and stored at room temperature without requiring a cold chain. In summary, this study has shown that the RealAmp method is a potential of field use as a tool for detection of A. baumannii.",
