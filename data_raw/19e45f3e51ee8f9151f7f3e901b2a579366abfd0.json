The rate of complications has been estimated to be around 1/4000 cases for the GBS-like syndrome, and may be considerably higher for the teratogenic effects, although much remains unknown about the precise extent of the possible sequelae in fetuses and infants. A significant contributing factor to this knowledge gap is that up to 80 % of Zika virus infections may be asymptomatic, and these 'silently' infected women with potentially affected fetuses and babies may go unnoticed.",

In addition, 7DMA shows modest anti-ZIKV activity in mice. Ribavirin and favipiravir are already approved for use as antiviral drugs in humans for other indications, but showed less in vitro antiviral effect against ZIKV than 7DMA. 7DMA and 2CMC were initially developed for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) which is distantly related to ZIKV, and studies have shown that these compounds have activity against other flaviviruses much more closely related to ZIKV like dengue virus (DENV). Of interest, other anti-HCV nucleoside analogues like the approved sofosbuvir and mericitabine (in clinical trials) also showed in vitro activity against DENV. GS-5734 and BCX4430 are two very broad spectrum anti-RNA virus nucleoside analogues that are currently in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. According to the manufacturer, BCX4430 reduced mortality in ZIKV-infected mice, but this data has yet to be published.",

Also, a major challenge is how and when such antiviral treatment would be applied, if available. The drug should be active in cells of the nervous system; it should cross the blood-brain-barrier and the placenta, and should be safe for pregnant women, their fetuses, and infants, which are by no means trivial concerns. For example, the unfavorable toxicity profile of ribavirin including teratogenicity limits its use to treat ZIKV infections in pregnant women. In addition, a lesson learned from treating other RNA viruses is that monotherapy can cause the rapid emergence of resistant viruses, stressing the need for development of drugs with different modes of action to reduce the likelihood of selecting out resistant strains.",
