Here we also provided the absolute number of self-reported symptoms and a visualisation of the mixing patterns by degree.

For at home and at other places the distributions of degree were fairly similar. During weekdays participants reported more contact persons at work or university, then during the weekend. There were no large differences in the total degree distributions (see 'at all locations') between weekdays and weekends. We investigated which covariates influence degree using a regression model. Firstly, we investigated which theoretical distribution best fitted the empirical distribution using the R package 'GAMLSS'.",
