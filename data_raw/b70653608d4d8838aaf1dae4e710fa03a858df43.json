A slippery sequence, U UUU UUA, and a stem-loop are well-defined RNA features modulating \u22121 frameshifting in HIV-1. The GGG glycine codon immediately following the slippery sequence (the 'intercodon') contributes structurally to the start of the stem-loop but has no defined role in current models of the frameshift mechanism, as slippage is inferred to occur before the intercodon has reached the ribosomal decoding site. This GGG codon is highly conserved in natural isolates of HIV. When the natural intercodon was replaced with a stop codon two different decoding molecules-eRF1 protein or a cognate suppressor tRNA-were able to access and decode the intercodon prior to \u22121 frameshifting. This implies significant slippage occurs when the intercodon is in the (perhaps distorted) ribosomal A site. We accommodate the influence of the intercodon in a model of frame maintenance versus frameshifting in HIV-1.",

The tightly controlled mechanisms that maintain fidelity can, however, be superseded by programmed events, one of which is programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [1] . PRF involves tRNA slippage either 5\u00b4(\u22121) or 3\u00b4(+1) relative to the mRNA followed by continued translation in the new reading frame. PRF has mostly been studied in the context of eukaryotic viruses, and, more rarely, in bacteria, yeast and higher eukaryotes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, there is growing recognition of PRF as a regulatory mechanism used by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes ( [9] [10] [11] and references therein). In the HIV-1 mRNA, \u22121 PRF results in translation of enzymatic domains and determines a specific ratio of enzymes to structural proteins critical for virus infectivity [12] , [13] .",

            "text": "PRF utilises a specific cis-element within the mRNA sequence where the change in reading frame occurs. In HIV-1 this sequence is a heptanucleotide string termed the 'slippery sequence' U UUU UUA (spaces separate codons in the 0 frame). Frameshift sites often contain additional RNA structural elements 3\u00b4of the slippery sequence that further stimulate frameshifting; in most viruses the downstream structure is a pseudoknot, although stem-loops and protein binding sites can also be used [14] [15] [16] [17] . For most strains of HIV-1, however, this structure is atypical and has been shown by NMR studies to be a stem-loop of two parts with an internal purine bulge, although recently it has been proposed that a network of pseudoknots exists in equilibrium with the widely accepted stem-loop structure [18] [19] [20] [21] . While slippage can occur using a minimal 25-nucleotide sequence containing only a 'slippery' element [22] , the downstream structure further stimulates the event to give frameshift efficiencies in the order of 5-10% dependent on the assay system used [23] . In vivo, the RNA helicase DDX17 modulates \u22121 PRF in HIV-1 [24] . The nucleotides immediately upstream of the slippery sequence, as well as distal elements of the HIV-1 RNA that affect the ribosomal density along the HIV-1 mRNA by modulating the rate of translation initiation, can also affect the efficiency of \u22121 PRF [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, the frameshift efficiency measured in vitro with the element alone placed between different bicistronic reporter systems is surprisingly similar to the in vivo rate [29] .",

This implied that the intercodon was present in the ribosomal A site prior to frameshifting. Interestingly, stop codons are found at the intercodon position immediately 3\u00b4of slippery sequences in several backward frameshift elements, such as those of Rous sarcoma virus and barley yellow dwarf virus [2] , [34] , as well as at the positions of forward frameshifting in +1 PRF elements [4] , [7] .",

We show that sense codon substitutions of the natural GGG intercodon significantly altered frameshift efficiencies. When this was substituted with a stop codon this efficiency was further modulated by over-expression of its decoding factors. Over-expression of the eukaryotic release factor, eRF1, decreased frameshift efficiency while cognate suppressor tRNA could increase frameshifting in competition with endogenous eRF1. Integrating these findings with current frameshift models, we propose a modified model of frameshifting in HIV-1 that takes into account the influence of the intercodon.",

A control element for normalisation of data contained a nullified slippery sequence (CUUCUGA) with the 3\u00b4Luc + gene in the original 0 frame such that output data reflect equimolar amounts of the two reporters synthesised. The human antizyme 1 (OAZ1) frameshift element of 120 nucleotides [7] was cloned into the dual luciferase vector but with the 3\u00b4Luc + in the +1 frame to ensure Luc + production only by a +1 frameshift. The same nullified construct (described above) was used for data normalisation. Constructs containing termination signals for readthrough assays were produced as described [39] , with the 3\u00b4Luc + gene in the original frame to ensure and measure continued translation only when termination failed. For data normalisation in this series, a construct containing the near-cognate UGG codon was used to produce equimolar amounts of both reporters.

Membranes were then blocked for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in TBST (40 MM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 MM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-eRF1 [48] (1:10000 dilution, a kind gift from Dr Adam Geballe (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA)) in TBST containing 5% (w/v) BSA, washed (3\u00d7 with TBST), incubated (1 h at 4\u00b0C) with rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) and 2% (w/v) milk powder, and washed (3\u00d7, with TBST). Finally, the membranes were incubated (1 h at 4\u00b0C) with goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) in TBST containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, and washed (3\u00d7, with TBST) before ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions and the membranes exposed to X-ray film. eRF1 expression was quantified relative to \u03b2-actin and the non-transfected control using the ImageQuant\u2122 TL software (Applied Biosystems).",

This observation is consistent with functional studies demonstrating that mutations perturbing \u22121 PRF dramatically effect replication efficiency of HIV-1. Moreover, recent observations indicate that only those mRNAs undergoing frameshifting are packaged into nascent HIV-1 virus particles, emphasising the importance of the PRF element [51] , [52] . The conserved consensus sequence of the \u22121 PRF element of HIV-1 is shown in Fig. 1A . In an alignment of 3534 HIV-1 sequences, derived mostly from patient blood samples, we noted the intercodon following the slippery sequence was almost as highly conserved as the slippery sequence itself (Fig. 1B) . Although minor variation was observed at the third position of the intercodon, 94.7% of sequences listed were GGG with G in this third position. The next most common codon was GGA (4.2%), and GGC was the only other codon with significant frequency (0.8%) (Fig. 1B) . The remaining 0.3% may represent 'noise' from non-functional sequences not detected by the exclusion criteria. The consensus \u22121 PRF element derived from these data is shown in Fig. 1C .",

Our examination of the sequence downstream of the intercodon corresponding to the extended stem-loop showed it is not as highly conserved as the intercodon that forms the start of the stem-loop (Fig. 1C) .

Caution is warranted in interpreting these results, as the (non-frameshifted) short-form Renilla luciferase generated by this reporter, terminated at the intercodon, is truncated by 15 amino acids compared to the other constructs. The same relative results between these constructs were observed in a different bicistronic reporter system using the fluorophores EGFP and DsRed.T4 (S1 File), however [29] . Collectively, these data suggest that the GGG intercodon of the HIV-1 frameshift element influences frameshifting in at least two ways: in a minor fashion by promoting the lower stem structure and increasing the chance for \u22121 PRF to occur, but also more markedly by exerting another major influence that is not explained by current models of \u22121 PRF.",

This model predicts that a purine would stack more easily than a pyrimidine due to its larger size and, therefore, would lower frameshift efficiency by providing greater stability for frame maintenance. By contrast, a pyrimidine in the same position would tend to be less effective [54] . Our results with GGG versus UGA (Fig. 2) were the opposite to that expected if such a stacking mechanism were dominant. We tested this further with a series of frameshift constructs with all four bases (A, G, C, T) for the first position of the intercodon, while the third base was either in the NGG or the NGA format. The order of frameshift efficiency for the NGG series was UGG>GGG>CGG>AGG whereas for the NGA series it was GGA>CGA>AGA>UGA (Fig. 3 ). In particular, the two purine bases, G and A, resulted in substantially different levels of frameshifting, which would not be predicted if base stacking were responsible for the major effect of the intercodon. Intriguingly, the two first base U codons, UGG (12% frameshifting) and UGA (3.5% frameshifting) were at the extremes. Notably, UGG is decoded by a tRNA while UGA is decoded by the eukaryotic protein release factor eRF1.",

First, we tested whether down-regulating eRF1, using RNAi, would affect the natural competition that occurs between eRF1 and near-cognate tRNAs at stop codons in vivo. Dual luciferase constructs where the downstream luciferase sequence was in the same frame as the upstream luciferase reporter but separated by a stop signal were used for this purpose. We established that at the weakest stop signals, where the near-cognate tRNAs more effectively compete with the release factor, up to 3% readthrough can occur even with endogenous levels of eRF1. Cellular levels of eRF1 mRNA and protein were decreased two-fold 120 h after transfection of the vector expressing shRNAs (\u03b1-eRF1), compared with the shRNA negative control (\u2212) (Fig. 4A & B) . Cellular eRF1 protein was depleted using two vector-expressed shRNA sequences, si90 and si1186 (adapted from si1187) known to target eRF1 mRNA [43] . Both shRNAs reduced eRF1 mRNA and protein expression similarly (see S2 File for si1186 data). For both shRNAs, the physiological significance of reducing eRF1 was demonstrated with increased readthrough of *4.5-fold at the weak termination signal, UGA CUG (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4C ). This reduction in eRF1 resulted in a *30% increase in frameshift efficiency (P < 0.01) at the natural antizyme frameshift element where frameshifting naturally occurs with a UGA intercodon (Fig. 4D ). This suggested that the cell was responding to the lowered concentration of eRF1 as expected.",

Although we did not observe this effect when eRF1 was over-expressed, given our uninterpretable results from depleting eRF1 we used suppressor tRNAs as an alternative decoding molecule of stop signals. Near-cognate tRNAs are naturally occurring potential suppressors of stop signals. They interact with termination codons by forming one or two base pairs with their anticodons but compete poorly with all but the weakest of stop signals. Artificially constructed cognate suppressor tRNAs that can form three Watson-Crick codon:anticodon interactions are highly competitive with eRF1 for decoding stop signals. If the changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency observed in Fig. 5E were mediated by a more general but unexplained property of eRF1, we would not expect to observe changes when using suppressor tRNAs. By contrast, if suppressor tRNAs modulated \u22121 PRF efficiency, then competition must be occurring between the suppressor tRNA and the endogenous eRF1 at the UGA intercodon within the ribosomal A site.",

Specifically, the role of GGG, found immediately after the slippery sequence, has been evaluated for its role in frameshifting in HIV-1. This 'intercodon' is almost as highly conserved as the slippery sequence itself and is more conserved than the other nucleotides of the stem-loop (Fig. 1) . The primary role of this intercodon in supporting \u22121 PRF efficiency does not appear to be either maintaining the structure of the lower stem-loop, or stacking of its first nucleotide on the last codon of the slippery sequence ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) . A strategy to test whether this intercodon has as its primary function an involvement in decoding before frameshifting utilised a stop codon substitution of the GGG intercodon. Both protein and tRNA decoding molecules for stop signals were then used to probe the decoding function of the intercodon. In this system, over-expression of the cognate decoding protein, eRF1, caused a reduction in-1 PRF (Fig. 5 ). This implied that the intercodon occupied the ribosomal A site and was available for decoding prior to at least a proportion of frameshift events. Suppressor tRNAs mitigated eRF1-induced reduction in \u22121 PRF efficiency, reinforcing the conclusion that the observed effects of eRF1 were specific to decoding activity in the A site of the ribosome.",

First, levels of eRF1 were reduced with expected effects on readthrough at a test stop codon and +1 antizyme frameshifting with a specific shRNA targeting eRF1, but not with the control shRNA, as expected. However, translation of the HIV-1 frameshift element was affected differently from these other test systems. The control and test shRNAs both affected frameshifting with the native element (not containing a stop codon), and yet neither affected the element where GGG was substituted with UGA. We speculate that expression of shRNAs may have triggered the innate interferon response, activating the kinase PKR to decrease translation initiation efficiency by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [56] [57] [58] . A slower translation rate increases frameshift efficiency in HIV-1 [28] . There is also evidence that the HIV-1 frameshift element is regulated by endogenous small RNAs [10] .

The amino acid corresponding to the last codon of the slippery sequence (UUU, coding for phenylalanine in the \u22121 frame; or UUA, coding for leucine in the 0 frame) has been found to be 20-30% phenylalanine and 70-80% leucine in the protein product of \u22121 PRF [3] , [60] , [61] . Incorporation of phenylalanine (the minority product) in this position would occur before the intercodon reaches the A site if the ribosome frameshifts prior to peptidyl transfer, resulting in UUU occupying the A site and being decoded by tRNA Phe . This pathway has been described in detail by Liao et al. (2011) [60] . Incorporation of leucine, by contrast, could occur either before or while the intercodon occupies the A site [32] , [60] . A possible pathway for the latter scenario, in which leucine is incorporated into the peptide chain while the intercodon occupies the ribosomal A site, is described below.",

The tRNA Gly interacting with the GGG intercodon may be distorted in the A site, essentially [26] , is positioned in the A site. The extended stem-loop is at the entrance to the ribosome, with the first nucleotide of the intercodon (orange) in the +13 position. B. The lower stem of the structure unwinds and allows the slippery sequence into the decoding centre. The stable upper stem-loop is positioned near the entry channel of the ribosome. Tension arising from resistance to unwinding may allow slippage from the A and P sites at this stage. C. After partial unwinding of the stable upper stem-loop, binding of tRNA Gly to the intercodon, perhaps in a distorted state, competes with \u22121 frameshifting. D. The tRNA Gly bound to the intercodon is decoded and translation proceeds in the 0 frame. This is the most common event, resulting in the translation of the Gag product. E. If the tRNA Gly is not decoded, \u22121 frameshifting by the E and P site tRNAs occurs to relieve tension on the mRNA, resulting in the translation of Gag-Pol. An incoming tRNA Arg is shown. unstable and poorly accommodated for peptide bond formation [32] . Consistent with this model, ribosomal mutations that increase the rate of accommodation negatively affect \u22121 PRF efficiency [67] .",

Different tRNAs, with their unique primary structures, modifications, and cellular concentrations would be predicted to have different binding capabilities to a distorted A site codon (as in Fig. 7C ). Consistent with this prediction, we observed a variation in frameshift efficiency among different intercodons decoded by different tRNAs (Fig. 3) . UGG (tRNA Trp ) was less capable, and AGG and CGG (tRNA Arg ) more capable of maintaining the reading frame compared with GGG (tRNA Gly ). A third base A (GGA, AGA and CGA intercodons) all produced significantly lower levels of frameshifting (i.e. better frame maintenance) than their third-base G counterparts, perhaps because A\u2022U wobble-base pairing is stronger than G\u2022U. Alternatively, the ribosome may undergo an incomplete translocation at this stage, resulting in elongation continuing in the \u22121 reading frame [31] . In a +1-frameshifting system, out-of-frame tRNAs are capable of influencing frameshifting, indicating substantial plasticity of the ribosome in these unusual circumstances [69] .",

For our studies a stop codon as the intercodon was artificially created for the HIV-1 site. In these cases, the decoding molecule is not a tRNA but a protein release factor, which, unlike a tRNA, does not interact solely with the triplet codon but also the downstream sequence of the mRNA [70] , [71] . Of interest is that the release factor has been shown to recognise disturbed stop codons in the A site of the bacterial ribosome [72] . Such an extended interaction between the release factor and mRNA:ribosome complex would be expected to compete strongly with frameshifting if the stop codon was occupying the ribosomal A site-more so than tRNA with the canonical mRNA:tRNA codon:anticodon interaction (and particularly if the intercodon is distorted in the A site). Consistent with this prediction, we found that the UGA suppressor tRNA was less able to prevent frameshifting than eRF1 at the HIV-1 site (Fig. 6C ). This effect would be predicted to depend upon the efficiency of decoding by the molecule during accommodation, after occupying the ribosomal decoding site, in addition to the concentration of the decoding molecule in the cell. In a distorted decoding site it is not easy to predict which decoding molecule (eRF1 or suppressor tRNA) would be the more efficient decoding molecule.",

However, in those ribosomes that do not 'escape' when the intercodon is in the A site, the tension placed on the mRNA is instead relieved by disruption of the codon:anticodon interactions of the P (and possibly E site) tRNA(s) to result in a 'spring-like' movement of the tRNAs and re-pairing in the \u22121 frame [62] .",

Indeed, the E site plays a general role in frame maintenance in prokaryotic ribosomes [75] . Three 16S rRNA mutations located in helices 21 and 22 increase \u22121 PRF with the HIV-1 element [26] , and these are involved in E site tRNA binding. The model presented in Fig. 7 is consistent with these observations, although our experimental data are not directly informative in this regard. For HIV-1, slippage might occur first at the E site followed by slippage at the P site [26] , [76] , as opposed to the simultaneous-slippage model proposed originally [3] . Additionally, in yeast Bekaert and Roussel (2005) showed bioinformatically when X XXY YYZ is in the P and A ribosomal sites the two nucleotides immediately upstream in the E site are highly biased, suggesting an extended signal. In yeast, high frameshift efficiency corresponded to a pseudouridine at tRNA position 39 that might decrease stability of the P or E site tRNA interactions [77] .",

            "text": "Several reasons suggest caution, however, in direct comparisons of our data with data from these studies. The dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element, while the HIV-1 Mtype element contains only a one-base spacer, or alternatively an 8-base spacer if only the more stable upper stem-loop is considered. This may lead to a pause in the case of the elements with large spacers, compared with a decrease in translation rate occurring earlier at the HIV-1 element until a more marked pause occurs when the stable upper stem-loop abuts the ribosome [63] . The ribosome has two mechanisms of helicase activity, which may differ with respect to these two downstream structures [65] .",

By contrast, prokaryotic elements contain an upstream internal Shine-Dalgarno sequence which helps pause the ribosome. There is known allosteric communication between the A site and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which may contribute to differences in the mechanism of \u22121 PRF in these cases [81] .

            "text": "During HIV-1 evolution the GGG intercodon may have been selected to give a level of frameshifting that produces a ratio of enzyme to structural proteins that best supports virus replication. The work presented in this study supports the hypothesis that \u22121 PRF in HIV-1 occurs relatively frequently with the slippery sequence at the E and P sites, and highlights that events during decoding of the intercodon are critical for frameshift efficiency. Namely, competition between decoding the GGG intercodon (resulting in regular translation with a maintained reading frame) and \u22121 PRF occurs in a portion of HIV-1 frameshift events. This scenario can be integrated into existing models of frameshifting and supports the notion that frameshifting in HIV-1 is a heterogeneous process. [29] .
