Bahrain is linked to the eastern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by a 25-km causeway that was launched in 1986. It is considered one of the busiest bridges in the region and has traffic statistics of almost 20 million passengers both ways based on 2013 data. However, despite this heavy traffic and the proximity to an area that is considered to have the highest reported cases and outbreaks, this is the first reported MERS-CoV case from that area. The reason for this observation is not clear, and no serology tests were performed on camels or humans in Bahrain to evaluate the genetic susceptibility, antibodies, or possible carrier state. We cannot confirm whether there were undetected cases.",

The importance of strict, wellorganized infection control policies should be addressed nationally and internationally. The rates of nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV are very high for reasons that are under investigation. In view of this, hospitals should upgrade their infection control measures and protocols when handling suspected or confirmed cases, which can prevent outbreaks.",
