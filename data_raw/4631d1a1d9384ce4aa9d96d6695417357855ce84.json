            "text": "Background: This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results: MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions: More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.",

China accounted for 17% of the global burden of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in 2013 and this is predicted to increase by 10% by 2025 [2] . The latest nationwide epidemiological survey in China reported that the 12-month prevalence of any mental disorder (excluding dementia) among the Chinese population was 9.3% and the prevalence of anxiety, depression and alcohol use disorders in this population all appear to be increasing [3] . Moreover, mental disorders increase the risk of suicide [4, 5] and China has one of the highest suicide rates in the world [6] .",

For example, a community-based survey among the general population in a north-western city of China (Xi'an) found that less than one quarter of individuals with a mental disorder diagnosis had sought mental health services in their lifetime [8, 9] . Structural barriers related to mental health service use include a scarcity of available human and financial resources and disparity in their distribution [10] . Individual factors include widespread stigmatising attitudes, poor recognition of mental disorders, low perceived need for treatment and limited knowledge of available services [8, 11] . These individual factors can be summarised by the concept of 'mental health literacy (MHL)', which has been defined by Jorm et al. as \"knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid in recognition, management, or prevention\" [12] .",

Early surveys in Australia [12] and other highincome countries [13, 14] typically reported relatively low levels of MHL in members of the public, leading to a wide range of interventions and campaigns to improve MHL [15, 16] . Evidence from these interventions has shown that improvements in MHL assisted in promoting early detection of mental disorders, reductions in stigmatising attitudes and enhanced help-seeking behaviours [17, 18] .",

However, some components of MHL, predominantly related to attitudes and knowledge, have been studied in China for many years [27] . For example, a variety of research activities on stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness had been conducted among the Chinese population [11, 28] . Examples of culturally specific beliefs about the causes of mental health problems in traditional Chinese culture include viewing mental illness as a punishment for the misconduct of family members and/or their ancestors, or beliefs that mental disorder are inflicted by a supreme being [29] . To further explore and counter these beliefs and to disseminate scientific knowledge, a number of studies focusing on knowledge about mental health problems have been conducted in China [22, 23, 30] .",

Initial thematic analysis used the framework outlined by Jorm et al. [12] , which was then modified according to the new themes that emerged. As the MHL domains vary among different types of participants, MHL domains were firstly analysed according to the type of participant (i.e. lay people, professionals and patients/carers), followed by three broad categories of MHL (i.e. knowledge, beliefs and behaviours/skills), and then more detailed subthemes.",

Delivery methods included face-to-face lectures, bulletins or booklets, although a few MHL studies used computers [23, 38] or the internet [39] . Related to the commonly-used KAP delivery method, most interventions focused on evaluation of changes in knowledge or attitudes. Though a limited number of surveys asked about respondents' intentions to provide help or first aid to others with mental health problems, no interventions aiming to promote such actions were found in this review. Furthermore, compared to the relatively large number of interventions targeted to patients or their carers (n = 21, accounting for 44.7% of all interventions) and non-mental health professionals and GPs (n = 16, 34.0%), little attention has been paid to MHL interventions for members of the public (n = 10, 21.3%). validation study of one (out of eight) of its questionnaires about mental health knowledge awareness among middle school students [42] , despite this questionnaire being originally developed for the general population.

However, there are differences in their geographic distribution, with most studies focusing on urban areas (n = 251, 71.7%) (see Fig. 2c ) and provinces in the east or south of China (see Fig. 3 ). Such geographic differences may be related to the uneven distribution of mental health service resources, which are clustered in and around big cities in economically booming areas in China [19] . The lack of locally available mental health service networks and mental health resources make it challenging to conduct MHL-related research in rural, remote or other less-developed regions. On the other hand, due to relatively low levels of education and the strong influence of traditional culture, people in these regions are more likely to have poorer MHL [48] , longer delays in receiving treatment, and more premature death related to mental disorders [49] . Therefore, more highquality MHL research in rural and less-developed regions in China is needed, and could be considered a matter of priority for the Central and local governments of China to achieve the aspirational goal of knowledge awareness rates set by its National Mental Health Plan [20] .",

In countries such as Australia where there has been a substantial increase in MHL research over the past 10 years, there has been a major focus on common mental disorders, most notably depression [17, 18] . Given the importance of early helpseeking, self-help and social support in reducing the burden of disease related to depression, this may also be a useful strategy for public education in China. The increasing prevalence of depression [50] and more mass media reports of depression cases or suicide cases related to depression among celebrities may also contribute to the greater awareness of depression among the population [51] . Psychosis has long been a priority in mental health management in China, partly due to its relatively greater burden on individuals and families, as well as its perceived influence on the safety and stability of the whole society [10] . The relatively high number of studies focusing on suicide is likely to be explained by concern about the suicide rate in China, which is among the highest in the world. In comparison, anxiety disorders have been the focus of relatively little MHL research (n = 29), although these disorders are reported to be the second most prevalent category of mental disorders in China [9] (with the first being mood disorders). The limited number of studies on substance use, bipolar disorder, mania or OCD and the gap in trauma/PTSD studies highlight the need for a wider range of mental disorders to be covered in the field of MHL research.",

However, this review suggests that current MHL interventions in China have paid relatively little attention to members of the public but have focused mainly on patients/their carers or non-mental health professionals. While there is a need to further support carers of people with severe mental illness, it is also necessary to improve MHL in members of the Chinese public to enable them to better assist those with mental health problems in their social networks.

This lays a foundation for developing interventions to assist members of the public to help others with mental health problems in the community. As the Chinese mental health system faces considerable challenges due to the increasing numbers of people seeking help for mental disorders [3, 9] and the severe shortage of mental health professionals [48] , such interventions could play a role in building capacity in non-mental health professionals and empower community members to work together to improve population mental health [7] .",

Some of these are of good quality and have been widely adopted in relevant research [43, 46, 47] , which facilities comparison between studies. Still, insufficient validation of tools used for measurement of MHL found in this review should be addressed in future studies.",

Nevertheless, it is important to consider several limitations of this review when interpreting its findings. While this review was comprehensive and broad, we did not perform any quality assessment of included publications, although we only included peer-reviewed publications. MHL related studies published before the year of 1997 were not included, but we believe that this number is not large judging by the time trend of MHL publications observed in this review.",

The research has involved a diversity of settings and participants. MHL research into a broader range of mental disorders, such as substance use disorders, bipolar disorder and trauma, are warranted. Interventions targeted to the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, including help seeking and skills to help people who are developing mental health problems, are also needed. Such programs should be evaluated with higherquality study designs, such as controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for MHL measurements should also be addressed in future studies. Findings of this review provides evidence to policy makers, practitioners and consumers, and assists in underpinning future research areas.",
