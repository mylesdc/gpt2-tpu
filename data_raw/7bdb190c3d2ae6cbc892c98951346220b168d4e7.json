In this study, the two diagnostic assays that targeted respectively on Mp-antibody and Mp-DNA were retrospectively investigated. Methods: A total of 3146 children were clinically diagnosed to have CAP and were confirmed by chest X-ray during March 2015 to February 2016 in Children's hospital of Hebei Province (China). Both of the sera and sputum samples were collected in 24 h after their admission. The Mp-antibody was examined by the passive particle agglutination assay and a fourfold or greater increase of antibody titers of paired sera or\u22671:160 titer of single serum was set as the serology positive. Mp-DNA in the sputum samples was tested by a multiplex-PCR method named GeXP assay (multiplex PCR combined with automated capillary electrophoresis). In order to eliminate the false positive results caused by the asymptomatic carriage after infected by M. pneumoniae, the inconsistent samples were tested by the real-time isothermal transcription-mediated RNA amplification assay (SAT).",

Among these, the multiplex-PCR has been accepted as a more practical diagnosis method in M. pneumoniae CAP, because the existence of clinical similarity resulted from Mp and other agents [7] and the common appearance of the viral co-infections [8] . Thus, in the recent study, the M. pneumoniae was added into our previously used pathogen panel that included 20 types/subtypes of viruses [9] . Meanwhile, several other groups have also designed the multiplex-PCR for the early detection of M. pneumoniae infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , but so far, the direct comparison between multiplex-PCR and serology test in larger pediatric clinical samples has rarely been reported [6] . Besides, the M. pneumoniae RNA detection (real-time isothermal transcription-mediated RNA amplification assay, Mp-SAT) that targeted on the specific 16SrRNA has been invented and investigated [18, 19] , which could eliminate the false positive cases resulted from the previous infection or the nonpathogenic carrier state [20] .",

Determination as well as comparison between laboratory diagnosis methods of M. pneumoniae infection for childhood CAP in larger clinical database has not been reported. In the present study, we applied a multiplex-PCR, named GeXP assay, to detected 13 types of pathogens including M. pneumoniae in 3146 sputum samples from hospitalized CAP children. Meanwhile, their serum specimens were also collected to be tested the antibody against M. pneumoniae. After the comparison between serology and GeXP assays on the same patient, about 93.7% of cases were diagnosed to be either positive or negative based on these 2 methods. We randomly chose 46 samples from 198 samples that had been tested to be inconsistent by serology and GeXP assays, redo the Mp-SAT and found 97.8% diagnosis agreement between SAT and GeXP assays, but not with the serology testing. Further analysis revealed that children in whom M. pneumoniae was only examined to be positive by GeXP or serology were significantly younger than those of both methods positive. About 37% of patients have virus-Mp coinfection, which were most observed in infantile patients. Seasonal distribution analysis revealed that the virus-Mp coinfection were predominant in spring and winter, while Mp-only infection was more frequently identified in summer and autumn.",

            "text": "Only a few reports have thus far described the comparison between serology and mono-PCR assays for M. pneumoniae detection in pediatric CAP patients [28] [29] [30] [31] . Using the paired sera samples, three independent research groups all observed excellent diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods [28] [29] [30] , in [31] . This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the proportion of paired sera. Because in our results, only 13% patients provided their second sera specimen, the good concordance could be observed between these paired sera with multiplex-PCR, On the other hand, after comparing the mono-PCR and serology assay, Kim proposed that a single titer \u22671:640 were considered to indicate the acute M. pneumoniae infection [31] . But in clinical, a presumptive diagnosis could be made from a single acute-phase serum titer \u22671:160 [24] . Therefore, if we interpret the Multiplex-PCR positive samples as truly indicating Mp infection, the high 'false positive rate' of serology testing (42%, 179/422) may caused by the proportion of paired sera and the criteria of diagnosis. Besides that, the serology 'false positive rate' was probably due to the other two aspects: Firstly, the serology assay is claimed to detect both of Mp-IgM and IgG [22] , the positive serology results may be caused by an earlier (not current) Mp infection, which is still detectable in the blood. Alternatively, the current infection truly exists, but the amount of organism was below the detection limit of multiplex-PCR. It has been reported that the diagnostic accuracy of PCR may decrease at \u22657 days after onset of disease in contrast to serology [32] , especially patients who receive week duration of the antibiotic treatment [31] . Besides these mono-PCR studies, as reviewed by Loens et al. [6] , several groups have applied the multiplex-PCR in the detection of M. pneumoniae infection, but the comparison assays were set as culture and/or mono-PCR, which are more suitable for accuracy validation during the methodology establishment process rather than obtaining the clinical diagnostic significance. In addition, Due to the high viral coinfection prevalence reported by Chen (25.9% [33] ) and ours (37.0%), it is essential to recommend the use of multiplex-PCR assay to provide more pathogen information. More importantly, in Mp IgM-positive children, a negative PCR result was reported to be associated with coinfection by other pathogens [32] . Our results also demonstrated that the youngest children group exhibited highest Serology(+)/ Multiplex-PCR (\u2212) rate and highest coinfection rate. In young children, since the serology positive cases may be result from other pathogen infection, the multiplex-PCR should be used to rectify these sorts of false positive cases determined by serology. Furthermore, a number of studies have demonstrated a weak or deferred antibody response to M. pneumoniae in young children [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , suggesting a possible reason leading to the highest Serology (\u2212)/Multiplex-PCR (+) rate observed in the youngest patients group in our study. In conclusion, owing to the high coinfection rate and weak antibody response in young children, the Mp infection is needed to be monitored not only by the serology assay. A combination of serology and multiplex-PCR allows for both decreased 'false positive' and 'false negative' rates of serology assay.",

Previous work has shown that the colonization of M. pneumoniae may cause the false positive results [37] [38] [39] . To rule out the possible false positive results of multiplex-PCR (targeting Mp-DNA) caused by colonization, the SAT assay (targeting Mp-RNA) were applied and we found that a overwhelming majority (94.7%, 18/19) of Multiplex-PCR (+)/Serology (\u2212) sputum specimens were proved to be SAT positive. On the contrast, the randomly selected Multiplex-PCR (\u2212)/Serology (+) sputum specimens were all observed to be SAT negative. These data suggest that the multiplex-PCR assay would be more reliable when the serology assay exhibits the opposite results. However, we felt a verification experiment with larger sample size should be used in future work. Another limitation of this work is that the highly specialized equipment is needed, namely an automated nucleic acid extraction system, which could carried out 48 samples at one time in about 1 h. Many primary hospitals or clinical laboratories do not have this equipment, and the manual work would greatly increase the turnaround time.",
