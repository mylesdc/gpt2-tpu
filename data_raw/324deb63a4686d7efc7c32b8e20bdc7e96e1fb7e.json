The main components in licorice root were analyzed through HPLC. The contents of two components in spaceflight groups were higher than that of the ground control ones. Three acute inflammatory models including xyleneinduced auricular edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability were utilized to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of licorice pre and post spaceflight. The licorice extract showed the significant anti-inflammation activity. After the spaceflight, the pharmacological activity of licorice got higher than that of the ground control one. All of the models gained the tendency that the spaceflight group of species Hangjinqi had the strongest activity than other groups.

The subplantar injection of carrageenan in control rats induced an increase in paw thickness over 6 h. At 0.5, 1, 2, and 6 h after i.g. administration, pre-treament with licorice root extracts (0.5, 1, and 2 g/Kg) inhibited oedema in a dose-dependent fashion and dexamethasone significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the increase in paw thickness induced by carrageenan. Vascular permeability induced by acetic acid was measured by Evan's blue dye from the abdominal cavity. As shown in Table 4 , licorice extractions inhibited the acetic acid-induced extravasation of Evan's blue dye in mice approximately from 9.62% to 37.19% respectively as compared to a control (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Thus, it may have a membrane stabilizing effect that reduces the capillary permeability.

All models gained the tendency that the spaceflight group of species H had the strongest activity than other groups. The complex space environment such as cosmic rays, gravity, micro gravity, super vacuum, weak electromagnetic fields and other special factors can cause the changes in morphology and at cytogenetic, physiological and molecular levels (16, 17). Spaceflight induced a higher percentage of cells with chromosomal aberrations (18). The cytogenetic damage and hereditary mutation in plant seeds such as tomatoes, potatoes and fungi have been reported and the results of the space experiments showed that the spaceflight will generate mutation leading to the plant genetic variation (19, 20) . Quite a few researches on the space, the environment influence on plant development and metabolism were conducted in order to get new varieties plants of high-quality productive such as germination rate getting higher in wheat after the spaceflight and leaf chlorophyll content increasing in tomatoes and cucumbers. Space science provides a novel and unique opportunity for plant breeding.",

It was demonstrated that weightlessness alone could somewhat trigger genomic alterations and result in increased gene expression, while ionizing radiation would enhance the effect of weightlessness. As two important components in licorice root, liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid play significant role not only in pharmacodynamic action but in the quantity control. In this study, the HPLC analysis showed that the contents of liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid in licorice roots were higher in the spaceflight group than that of the ground control group.

At this point, the comparison of anti-inflammatory activity between the spaceflight licorice and the ground control one was conducted through three kinds of inflammatory models and evaluated the changes in pharmacological activity after the spaceflight. The experimental results showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of the space group in two species was higher than that of the ground control group.

Licorice roots extract were administrated orally to rats; three acute inflammatory models demonstrated the diversity of pharmacological activity after the spaceflight.
