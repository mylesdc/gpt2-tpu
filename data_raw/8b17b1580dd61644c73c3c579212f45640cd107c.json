Cell stiffness was assessed by measuring the entry time (ET) of a single cell into a microchannel with a 6 \u00d7 9-\u03bcm cross-section under a constant pressure drop (\u0394P = 160 Pa). Primary neutrophils and monocytes, as well as the monocytic THP-1 cell line, were used. Cellular adhesiveness to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was examined using the laminar flow chamber method. We compared the properties of cells incubated with the sera of healthy volunteers (n = 5), patients presenting with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE; n = 6), and patients with ARDS (n = 22), of whom 13 were classified as having moderate to severe disease and the remaining 9 as having mild disease.",

Systematic measurements with the THP-1 cell line allowed for the establishment of a strong correlation between stiffening and the severity of respiratory status (mean ET 0.82 \u00b1 0.08 seconds for healthy subjects, 1.6 \u00b1 1.0 seconds for ACPE groups, 10.5 \u00b1 6.1 seconds for mild ARDS, and 20.0 \u00b1 8.1 seconds for moderate to severe ARDS; p < 0.05). Stiffening correlated with the cytokines interleukin IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10 but not with interferon-\u03b3, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, IL-6, or IL-17. Strong stiffening was induced by IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 but not by IL-10, and incubations with sera and blocking antibodies against IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, or TNF-\u03b1 significantly diminished the stiffening effect of serum. In contrast, the measurements of integrin expression (CD11b, CD11a, CD18, CD49d) and leukocyte-endothelium adhesion showed a weak and slow response after incubation with the sera of patients with ARDS (several hours), suggesting a lesser role of leukocyte adhesiveness compared with leukocyte stiffness in early ARDS.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been identified as a bilateral pulmonary inflammatory condition that follows direct or indirect lung injury [1] . Rigorous clinical management has not reduced the mortality of ARDS to <30 % [2] , mainly owing to a lack of understanding of ARDS pathophysiology. The sequestration of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, in the lung microvasculature [3] appears to be a key determinant of the pathophysiology of ARDS, leading to blood circulation blockage, microthrombus formation [4, 5] , uncontrolled inflammation, and injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane [1] . Researchers have attempted to clarify the mechanisms involved in leukocyte sequestration in many studies. Changes in leukocyte adhesion to vessel walls have been reported in various inflammation contexts [6] [7] [8] [9] , notably in ARDS [9] . In vitro studies [10, 11] have also shown that a fraction of circulating leukocytes of patients with ARDS, as well as patients with sepsis, trauma, and pneumonia, resulted in impaired deformability most likely caused by the densification of F-actin in the cortical region [6, 10] , suggesting a role of leukocyte stiffening in sequestration of leukocytes in lung capillaries [4] . However, the roles of leukocyte adhesion and stiffness remain unclear. Microcirculation impairments have been associated with abnormal concentrations of cytokines and endotoxins in various inflammatory diseases [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , but the case of ARDS has rarely been studied. Moreover, consensus conclusions have been difficult to draw due to the diversity of experimental conditions and models. For instance, some studies have failed to show any effect of interleukin (IL)-8 on leukocyte stiffness [12, 19] , whereas others have found a pronounced effect [16] . Additionally, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 have been reported to promote adherence in some conditions [12] , whereas no effects have been detected in other studies [8, 20] . Altogether, it appears that the triggering events of ARDS, mainly leukocyte sequestration in the lungs, remain largely obscure with regard to the mechanisms and biochemical signaling involved.",

All consecutive mechanically ventilated patients presenting with ARDS, as defined according to the Berlin definition [21] , were included when they were early in the course of the disease. Within 2 days of ARDS onset, the lower ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) was measured and used to classify the patients with ARDS according to the Berlin definition. Patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios <200 mmHg were assigned to the moderate to severe ARDS group, and patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio between 200 and 300 mmHg were assigned to the mild ARDS group. Volume assist control ventilation was used with a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of predicted body weight and a maximal plateau pressure of 32 cmH 2 O. The oxygenation goal was a pulse oximetry-measured arterial oxygen saturation of 88-95 % or a PaO 2 of 55-80 mmHg, with the FiO 2 and positive end-expiratory pressure adjusted as in the ARMA trial [22] . Five healthy volunteers from our medical department served as the healthy group. Six mechanically ventilated patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) were also enrolled as the ACPE group. Septic shock (SS) was defined in accordance with the 2001 Society of Critical Care Medicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/American College of Chest Physicians/American Thoracic Society/Surgical Infection Society International Sepsis Definitions Conference criteria [23] .

Cells incubated in sera were directed into microfluidic circuitry by varying the height of the macroscopic reservoirs (Additional file 1: Figure S1a ) connected to a microfluidic chip positioned on a microscope stage (Additional file 1: Figure S1b ). The ET into a microfluidic constriction is known to be a good indicator of cell stiffness [14, 25] . However, devices with a single constriction have been found to be poorly adapted for cells of elevated stiffness because the mismatch between the rectangular cross-section of microfluidic channels and the spherical shape of the cells allows for flow leakage around the cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1c [i]) and induces poor ET reproducibility. The device used in this study had two constrictions in series, C1 and C2, of similar width (W = 6 \u03bcm) and with heights of H 1 = 12 \u03bcm and H 2 = 9 \u03bcm, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S1d , e). A cell was first forced into constriction C1, where it occupied the entire crosssection of the channel and therefore prevented leaks in corners (Additional file 1: Figure S1c [ii]). Cell stiffness was then assessed by examining the cell's passage from constriction C1 into the narrower constriction C2. The ET of each single cell was determined by examining video microscopy sequences as the time interval between the leading edge of the cell touching the entrance of constriction C2 and the trailing edge of the cell clearing the entrance of constriction C2 (Additional file 1: Figure  S1c [iii], c[iv]).",

This leukocyte stiffening was associated with the severity of ARDS. The low expression of adhesion molecules of the integrin family suggested that leukocyte stiffening plays a more important role than adhesiveness in their sequestration in the lung microvasculature in the early phase of ARDS. Analysis of serum composition and the use of recombinant cytokines showed that cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 were major contributors to leukocyte stiffening by the sera of patients with ARDS. Finally, blocking Ab against IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 was found to protect leukocytes from serum-induced stiffening. Various methods have been employed to evaluate leukocyte deformability, but there is no standard tool for clinical applications. Microfiltration experiments, such as cell transit analysis, have been used to study sepsis and lung injury [10, 18] , but the transit times of cell suspensions through micropore filters remain qualitative and cannot distinguish between the effects of adhesiveness or stiffness, because both are possible in these assays. Conversely, single-cell methods, such as micropipette aspiration [19] , cell poker [15, 25] , or atomic force microscopy [14] , allow for precise mechanical measurements, but their throughput is too low for medical studies. The strategy of using microfluidics allows one to design higher-throughput experiments [14, 25] for adhesiveness or stiffness and to mimic the targeted physiological conditions of the geometry (approximately 6 \u03bcm) and pressure (about 100 Pa) of the lung microvasculature, as was done in the present study.

Additionally, the THP-1 cell line as a model was supported by the strong similarities of these cells to monocytes with regard to migration stimulated by N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine [32] , phospholipase D activation of adhesion [33] , increase in the mechanical strength of adhesion to endothelial cells induced by monocyte colony-stimulating factor [34] , stimulation with coronavirus responsible for an ARDS-like syndrome [35] , and the binding of chemotactic factors to THP-1 cells and neutrophils [36] .

To the best of our knowledge, the investigators in the only study in which leukocyte stiffness during ARDS was measured [12] reported that leukocyte populations were moderately stiffened and that very few cells (<5 %) had extremely high stiffness. We also found a bimodal distribution, but interestingly the population of highly stiff cells represented, in our data, approximately 50 % of all of the cells. This finding suggested that the earlier study of patients' cells [12] could have been biased by the trapping of the stiffest cells in the patients' microvasculature, whereas our serum-based findings, with a large proportion of more stiffened cells, would be more representative of patients' whole leukocyte populations. Our study is also the first to demonstrate leukocyte stiffening induced by incubation with the sera of patients with ARDS. The serum stiffening effect was rather rapid (<1 h), compatible with a role in the early triggering of leukocyte sequestration in the microvasculature. In the end, the associations of the severity of ARDS with leukocyte stiffening and the presence of leukocyte stiffening independent of SS support an intrinsic role for leukocyte stiffness in the pathogenesis of lung injury.",

            "text": "Regarding leukocyte adhesion evaluated by the expression of integrin receptors, the literature shows a very limited and rather slow upregulation of adhesion molecules in the plasma of patients with sepsis (e.g., CD49d for neutrophils) [8] [9] [10] . With our samples and with similar incubation conditions, faint effects of adhesion molecule upregulation were not detectable, whereas cell stiffening was found to be fast and strong. This finding suggests that circulating factors might favor leukocyte adhesion, but only after a delay of several hours. Interestingly, adhesion, as shown by laminar flow experiments after exposure to ARDS sera, was not significantly increased, further demonstrating that adhesion might not play a major role in early ARDS. In the end, one could conclude that leukocyte arrest in the microvasculature in ARDS might be triggered by rapid leukocyte stiffening at early time points (within 1 h), whereas adhesiveness may develop at later stages. Interestingly, similar scenarios have previously been proposed for other pathologies [37] [38] [39] .",

However, we found no correlation between IL-6 and leukocyte stiffening, suggesting that the role of IL-6, if any, is not dominant. Indeed, leukocyte stiffening appeared in vitro at IL-6 concentrations >10,000 pg/ml [20] , which is much higher than the content in the sera of our patients with ARDS. We found that TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 induced leukocyte stiffening. Similar effects were reported for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 at concentration thresholds >100 pg/ml [13, 20] . We showed a significant stiffening effect at <10 pg/ml for IL-1\u03b2 and at 20 pg/ml for TNF-\u03b1. For IL-8, previous researchers have reported no effects [13, 20] at 10,000 pg/ml and a transient (1 h) effect at 1000 pg/ml [17] . We found strong stiffening within 1 h with IL-8 at only 1000 pg/ml. Our experiments with Ab confirmed the direct participation of these three cytokines in the stiffening effect of serum, as monoblockade of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, or TNF-\u03b1 significantly reduced the effect. However, our results with pure recombinants and with sera mixed with Ab against each cytokine suggested that other substances, which remain to be identified, played additive and/or synergistic roles.",

Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, reduces neutrophil stiffening, but its efficacy for treating hemorrhagic shock has been found to be very limited [14, 40] . Blocking Ab against TNF-\u03b1 provided weak prophylactic and poor therapeutic effects in large cohorts of patients with sepsis [37] . Nevertheless, patients with sepsis and lung injury might benefit from the blockade of multiple cytokine pathways because researchers in recent studies of mice and humans have reported beneficial responses in cases of acute lung injury [38] and sepsis [39] . Our results regarding protection against stiffening by blocking Ab support the exploration of cytokine regulation for therapeutic purposes. Previous unsuccessful clinical assays have been based on long-term treatments, and future assays could benefit from regular monitoring of leukocyte stiffness during treatment with a microfluidic tool to adjust the treatment dose and time. This rationale would also be helpful for other therapeutic approaches, such as treatment with sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor that limited leukocyte stiffening in vitro [18] , benefited pulmonary function [41] , and improved the survival of patients with ARDS with sepsis [42] .",

The relationship between leukocyte stiffening and the severity of ARDS suggests a role for leukocyte stiffening in ARDS pathophysiology. Stiffness, rather than adhesiveness, might play an important role in leukocyte sequestration in early ARDS. IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 are major contributors to leukocyte stiffening in ARDS sera. Blocking Ab against IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 was shown to protect leukocytes from stiffening in sera.",
