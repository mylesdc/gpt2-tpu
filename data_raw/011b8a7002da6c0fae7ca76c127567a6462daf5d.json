Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (\u03fe85%) and low (\u03fd60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (\u03f360 to 85%). At an AH of less than 22 g \u00b7 m \u03ea3 , the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g \u00b7 m \u03ea3 , the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.",

Both influenza and SARS exhibit seasonality, with increased incidence during wintertime in temperate regions and perhaps during the rainy season in tropical regions (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Understanding infectious disease transmission is a complex problem due to the many factors involved, such as environmental conditions, human activity (e.g., more crowding in buildings during wintertime), hygiene, and host susceptibility. Environmental conditions are particularly compelling to examine when considering seasonality due to clear changes in weather throughout the year in temperate regions.",

The first studies of the effect of RH on influenza virus survival emerged in the 1940s (19, 20) , and more followed (21) (22) (23) (24) . The results indicated either a monotonically decreasing relationship between virus survival and humidity (i.e., lower survival at high humidity) or a \"U-shaped\" relationship with reduced survival at midrange humidities. Two studies described similar relationships for the SARS coronavirus and its surrogates (25, 26) . The seemingly conflicting results may be due to the use of different media for virus suspensions (13) .",

AH describes the mass of water vapor per volume of air (i.e., the concentration of water vapor in air), while RH describes the ratio of the actual concentration of water vapor to the maximum possible concentration, which varies strongly with temperature. Shaman and Kohn (12) have concluded that the relationship is stronger with AH than with RH. According to their analysis of virus survival in aerosols (24) and transmission in guinea pigs (16) , AH explains 50% and 90% of the variability in influenza virus transmission and survival, respectively, whereas RH explains only 12% and 36%, respectively, of the variability. In a study examining influenza virus survival in droplets at elevated temperatures (55 to 65\u00b0C), McDevitt et al. (27) also reported that AH is a better predictor than RH for virus inactivation. Shaman et al. (15) have modeled influenza-related mortality and suggested that changes in AH alone are the root cause of seasonal trends, whereas RH is a poor predictor. A causality analysis of global flu incidence data has shown that AH is a stronger driver than RH (18) .",

The relationship between survival and humidity is confounded by the fact that higher values of AH can only be achieved at higher temperatures, which are known to accelerate virus inactivation (28) . Epidemiological studies involving humidity have necessarily relied on data from outdoor weather stations, but almost all transmission probably takes place indoors, where people spend 90% of their time (29) . Indoor RH is very strongly correlated with outdoor AH during the winter heating season (30), so we cannot yet rule out RH as a predictor for influenza incidence. Finally, we have proposed a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between virus survival with RH that revolves around the extent of evaporation and the resulting increase in solute concentrations in droplets (13), but we are not able to identify one for AH.",

We exposed an enveloped virus to seven environmentally relevant RHs and four temperatures to test the hypothesis that RH is more important than AH in modulating virus infectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize that over the range of temperatures typically found indoors (19 to 25\u00b0C), temperature does not have a significant effect on infectivity. The resulting data set is larger than has been obtained previously and enables a robust analysis that goes beyond simple linear regression. Due to the challenges and biosafety concerns of working with the influenza virus and coronavirus, this study employed the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for the influenza virus (31, 32) and SARS coronavirus (33) . Our results provide novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets. This methodology may serve as a model for future efforts to study viruses that require more stringent biosafety protocols and to assess whether the results shown here are generalizable to other viruses.",

This study was designed specifically to compare the importance of RH, AH, and temperature as predictors of enveloped virus survival in droplets. Ultimately, we hope this work can help explain the trends in diseases caused by enveloped viruses and lead to improved disease control strategies. Our results suggest that in determining virus infectivity, the interaction among RH, AH, and temperature is complex and not easily captured by linear or log-linear regressions. Shaman and Kohn (12) found that AH was more important than RH in determining virus survivability, but they only evaluated each variable singly.

The random forest model fit the data best of all the approaches used (R 2 \u03ed 0.83).

Random forests have the advantage that they do not need a prespecified model to evaluate as regressions do. Random forests develop the model based on the data and can thus provide improved results for models based on correlated interacting variables (34) . They also directly supply a variable importance.

We previously proposed a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between influenza survival in droplets and RH, with partial evaporation and subsequent concentration of solutes explaining some of the results observed (13) . Briefly, when virus is released into the environment as part of a respiratory fluid droplet, RH, not AH, controls how much water evaporates from the droplet until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding air, as described by the Kohler equation. The amount of water lost affects salt and protein concentrations, and potentially pH, in the droplet, and changes in these properties could affect virus survival, although more work is needed to understand these effects on a physiological level.",

Larger droplets can take a long time to evaporate, especially at high humidity, while very small droplets are able to evaporate in milliseconds (37) . One potential explanation for why we observed a significant effect of temperature on virus infectivity at high humidities (\u03fe60%) and not lower humidities (Fig. 1) is because at lower humidities, the droplets evaporated and the virus was potentially in a \"desiccated\" state that was unaffected by changes in temperature. It is well known that other biological materials (e.g., bacterial spores, fungal spores, and nematodes) are able to survive in a desiccated state, and in fact, desiccation is used for the long-term preservation of microbial samples (38, 39) . Greiff and Rightsel (40) showed that removing the residual moisture from influenza virus to \u03f32% enabled the virus to maintain its titer level for 13 to 20 days at 28\u00b0C and 2.5 to 3.5 days at 45\u00b0C. However, \"overdrying\" and removing too much moisture produced a less protective effect; when dried to a residual moisture of 0.4%, the influenza titer was only maintained for 2 days at 28\u00b0C. In our study, at higher humidities (\u03fe60%), the droplets remained wet, and thus virus infectivity was potentially affected by both temperature-mediated exponential decay as defined by the Arrhenius equation and changes in droplet chemistry due to the partial evaporation of water. We speculate that at a very high humidity (\u03fe85%), virus decay is modulated by temperature changes (since the droplet is at near-physiological conditions), while at a midrange RH (60 to 85%), virus decay is due to changes in droplet chemistry due to evaporation. A full mechanistic explanation may be revealed by future research examining the chemistry of evaporating droplets and the physiological effect on virus.",

Contrary to our initial hypothesis that temperature over the range of that typically found indoors (19 to 25\u00b0C) does not have a significant effect on virus infectivity, we found that this small range can have profound effects on infectivity at a fixed RH of 75%. Over this range, virus infectivity decreases exponentially with increasing temperatures (Fig. 3) . During the wintertime, when most diseases caused by enveloped viruses reach peak incidence, building temperatures are typically lower than during the summertime in order to save energy and money. However, lower indoor temperatures create a more favorable environment for virus survival. For example, if the RH is constant at 60% in a building, our results predict that virus infectivity would be \u03f37.5% at 19\u00b0C but only \u03f32.8% at 25\u00b0C, a \u03fe2-fold reduction in infectivity.",

Additionally, this RH is likely to promote the growth and survival of some bacterial and fungal species (43, 44) . Mold grows best when the RH is above 60%, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends keeping indoor RH between 30% and 50% (45) .

            "text": "There are some potential limitations to this study. First, to overcome some of the challenges and technical limitations of working with human pathogens, previous research has suggested that bacteriophage Phi6 is an appropriate surrogate for infectious enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza, and SARS) (31) (32) (33) . The advantages of working with Phi6 include its biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) biohazard rating, the ability to rapidly and accurately quantify virus infectivity through plaque assays, and its extensive characterization. Phi6, influenza, and coronaviruses are all lipid-enveloped RNA viruses that are \u03f3100 nm in diameter. One important molecular difference is that Phi6 contains double-stranded RNA, while influenza and coronaviruses contain single-stranded RNA. It is unlikely, but possible, that this molecular difference could lead to differences in infectivity as a function of environmental conditions; however, this requires future research. Researchers recently evaluated the suitability of Phi6 as a universal surrogate and cautioned that it might not be an appropriate surrogate for all enveloped viruses in all environments (46) . Whereas only 1 to 10% of influenza virus particles are infectious (47, 48) , nearly all bacteriophage particles are thought to be infectious, and so infectivity may be much more labile for influenza virus than for the surrogate. As this study focuses on the patterns in decay as a function of temperature and humidity rather than the absolute value of decay, differences in lability are hopefully minimized. Additionally, one might argue that droplets are not representative of aerosols, but we have observed similar results for Phi6 infectivity versus RH in both stationary droplets and suspended aerosols (Fig. 5) . Finally, Phi6 was suspended in tryptic soy broth (TSB; growth medium for Phi6) for these experiments, which is very simple compared to the respiratory fluid that typically surrounds enveloped viruses that have been expelled into the environment. The medium composition can have a profound effect on virus infectivity (13) . We have previously hypothesized that mucin glycoproteins might provide a protective effect for viruses against changes in RH (13). Understanding how different media protect viruses from changes in environmental conditions should be a future research priority.",

Future efforts are also needed to study viruses that require more stringent biosafety protocols to assess whether the results shown here are generalizable to pathogenic viruses. Additionally, we recommend that future studies use more physiologically relevant media (e.g., respiratory fluid) to test the hypotheses that (i) medium composition has an effect on virus infectivity when exposed to different environmental conditions and (ii) glycoproteins provide a protective effect for virus in droplets against changes in RH and temperature.

For the plaque assays, we first performed serial dilutions of our working stock in TSB medium. We then mixed 50 l of the diluted Phi6 with 250 l of overnight cultured P. syringae, with the coculture inoculated into 6.5 ml of TSB soft agar prewarmed to 50\u00b0C. We quickly, but fully, hand-shook the mixture and poured it onto TSA plates, which we rotated by hand to allow the top agar to form a smooth even layer on the TSA. After drying, we sealed the plates in Parafilm and incubated them at 25\u00b0C for 24 h. To determine the concentration of infectious Phi6 in a sample, we multiplied the number of observed plaques by the appropriate dilution coefficient. We calculated the relative infectious ratio after aging Phi6 droplets at a given temperature, RH, and AH as relative infectious ratio (%) \u03ed N E /N C , where N E and N C are the measured Phi6 concentrations (PFU \u00b7 ml \u03ea1 ) for the exposed and control samples, respectively. Droplets as a model for aerosols. To examine whether the droplets serve as a valid model for aerosols, we examined virus decay in both under the same environmental conditions. We performed the droplet experiments as described above, with the exception of aging for 1 h to mimic the aerosol experiments. We studied the effect of RH on Phi6 in aerosols using a rotating drum (50) . Briefly, a Collison nebulizer aerosolized Phi6 from a suspension in TSB into the drum at a controlled RH. We collected an unaged aerosol sample onto a gelatin filter and a sample that had been aged for 1 h onto another gelatin filter. To determine the infectivity of Phi6 in aerosols, we dissolved the filters in TSB and performed plaque assay on the samples. We corrected the results for losses in the rotating drum (50) .",

We calculated all statistics in R version 3.4.2 (51) and JMP Pro 13. To calculate random forests, we used the randomForest package version 4.6-12 in R. The calculation was based on 50,000 trees and the default one variable used at each split, given the three explanatory variables available. We fitted virus infectivity as a function of temperature as exponential decay and calculated a coefficient of determination using Excel. We used a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences (P \u03fd 0.05) in Phi6 infectivity between different temperatures, RH, and AH in JMP Pro 13.",
