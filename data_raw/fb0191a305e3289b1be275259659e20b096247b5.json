            "text": "The Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm (SW) [1, 2] is the most influential algorithm for aligning a pair of sequences. It is an essential component of the majority of aligners from the classical BLAST [3] to the more recent mappers. Although most of these aligners do not use SW directly to align a sequence to the whole genome sequence due to the quadratic time complexity of SW, they extensively use it for seed extension and for constructing the final alignment, and spend significant amount of CPU time on this algorithm. Due to the critical role of SW, many efforts have been made to accelerate SW, taking the advantages of special hardware such as single instruction multiple data (SIMD), field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU) [4] [5] [6] . Among the three, SIMD based algorithms are most frequently used because they are compatible with most modern x86 CPUs. SIMD acceleration methods can be further divided into intra-sequence parallelization [7] and inter-sequence parallelization [8] . Inter-sequence parallelization is only useful when many pairs of sequencing reads are aligned simultaneously; intrasequence parallelization however parallelizes for each single pairwise alignment, so it can be used more flexibly in various applications such as that needs aligning a single read against a potentially large genome reference sequence. Farrar's Striped SW [9] with SWPS3's [10] improvement is the fastest intrasequence parallelized SIMD implementation running on x86 processors with the Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2) instruction set. Indeed, Farrar's algorithm has been embedded in several popular genomic sequence mapping tools, such as BWA-SW [11] , Bowtie2 [12] , Novoalign (http:// www.novocraft.com/) and Stampy [13] .",

Firstly, implementing a striped SW requires good understanding of SSE2 instructions and the more complex algorithm, which may take significant development time. Secondly, the original striped SW only gives the optimal alignment score but does not report the position or the detailed alignment, the information necessary for using SW as a component to construct the final alignment. How to report the position and alignment without affecting speed is non-trivial. Thirdly, while a few implementations report position and alignment, they are tightly integrated in a larger project and cannot be easily reused in other programs. Fourthly, when aligning a short read against a long sequence, we would like to know suboptimal alignments such that we can tell if the optimal position is trustworthy. Most existing libraries have not addressed this issue.",

We provide the library with an executable alignment tool that can be used directly to perform protein or DNA alignments.

Moreover, since this tool is sufficiently fast and memory-efficient for alignment to very large reference genome sequences, e.g. the human genome, it can also be used to validate alignments produced by heuristic read mappers.

The same SW parameter settings as the tests on the simulated data sets are used in the experiment. The detailed genome and read information is described in Appendix S1 in File S1. The command lines used for read alignments are shown in Table S2 in File S1. These results indicate that even while returning a full optimal alignment and one suboptimal score, our SSW algorithm is just as fast as Farrar's accelerated version.",

This step is especially important for aligning reads containing short insertions and deletions. Even though each SW run is short, it may be applied hundreds of millions of times within a single run of a mapper, and therefore even small inefficiencies result in wasteful resource usage. To quantify time savings with SSW, we compared the performance of our new method with the existing SW implementation within the MOSAIK mapping program [14] , which uses SW for the final read alignments. We found that the SSW library achieves a two-fold speedup of the entire MOSAIK compared with the current banded SW implementation within it (see Table 1 ). Notably, MOSAIK is a multi-threaded program and thus the SSW component in MOSAIK is running in parallel.",

Primary read mappers are often unable to map or properly align reads in structural variant (SV) regions, e.g. in regions of deletions, insertions, inversions, or translocations. Therefore, we developed a split-read aligner program, SCISSORS (https://github.com/wanpinglee/scissors) to map reads across structural variation event boundaries (breakpoints), rescuing reads not mapped, or inaccurately mapped by primary mapping approaches. We used our SSW library to align \"orphaned\" or severely \"clipped\" fragment-end read mates (in the case of read pairs where one end-mate is aligned with high mapping quality, but the other mate is either unmapped or mapped with many unaligned or \"clipped-off\" bases) to the genomic regions indicated by the well-mapped mates' coordinates. Inclusion of the SW mapping routines of our SSW library makes accurate and fast split-read alignment for SV detection possible. The split-read mapping functionality, using our SSW library, has also been implemented in the TANGRAM SV detection tool (https://github.com/jiantao/ Tangram). TANGRAM is used intensively in the 1000 Genomes Project [15,16] to accurately detect MEIs (mobile element insertions) (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/ technical/working/20120815meicalls/BC/).

            "text": "Our algorithmic improvements focused on speeding up the Farrar's implementation and gaining access to the optimal alignment (in addition to the optimal achievable score), as well as the score of the best secondary alignment. For speedup, we adopted the \"lazy F loop\" improvement proposed by SWPS3 [7] . Furthermore we obtained additional alignment information compared to SWPS3 without slowing down the original algorithm: (1) we record the optimal alignment ending positions during the SIMD SW calculation and generate the detailed alignment by a reversed SIMD SW and a banded SW. When the score matrix is filled by the SIMD SW calculation, we store the maximal score of each column in a \"max\" array and record the complete column that has the maximal score of the whole matrix. Next, we locate the optimal alignment ending position on the reference and the query by seeking the maximal score in the array and the recorded column respectively. The reversed SIMD SW locates the best alignment beginning position from the ending position by calculating a much smaller scoring matrix. Then, the banded SW (whose band is defined by the beginning and ending positions) generates the detailed alignment. Since the alignment generation using the reversed SIMD SW and the banded SW only calculates a very small portion of the whole SW scoring matrix when the query sequence is much shorter than the target, in most cases of genome sequence alignment the corresponding time cost is trivial (2) . We determine the secondary alignment score by seeking the second largest score in the \"max\" array. To avoid a similar sub-alignment of the primary alignment returned, we mask the elements in the region of the primary alignment of the \"max\" array and locate the second largest score from the unmasked elements ( Figure 4) . As a crucial step for locating the alignment position and estimating the suboptimal score, the \"max\" array generation is completed by adding an SSE2 command in the inner loop of Farrar's implementation and another command in the outer loop, so that this additional time consumption is limited. Figure 4 . Illustration of alignment traceback and suboptimal alignment score determination. An example SW score matrix is shown (penalties for match, mismatch, gap open and extension are 2, -1, -2, and -1 respectively). The bottom row indicates the maximum score for each column. The algorithm locates the optimal alignment ending position (the black cell with score 9) using the array of maximum scores, and then traces back to the alignment start position (the black cell with score 2) by searching a much smaller, locally computed score matrix (circled by the black rectangle). Finally, a banded SW calculates the detailed alignment by searching the shaded sub-region. The scores connected by solid arrows belong to the optimal alignment. The max array records the largest score of each column. After the optimal alignment score (marked by \"best\") is found, its neighborhood is masked, and the second largest score is reported outside the masked region (marked by 2nd best). The scores connected by dashed-line arrows trace the suboptimal alignment. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082138.g004",
