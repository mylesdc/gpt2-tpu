The first outbreak of influenza in pigs was described in the UK before the 1950s [2] . The avian-like H1N1 was introduced into the swine population after the transmission of H1N1 virus from wild ducks to pigs in the late 1970s [3] and since 1979 it has replaced the antigenically and genetically distinguishable North American classical swine H1N1 viruses [2] . The H3N2 subtype of human origin formed a stable lineage in European pigs in the early 1970s, but reassortant H3N2 has been dominant since the mid-1980s [4] . The H1N2 subtype was first isolated in Great Britain in 1994 [5] .",

In earlier studies in Finland, antibodies indicating the circulation of swine influenza have not been detected. In 1993, a swine influenza survey was carried out and blood samples from slaughtered pigs were examined. Antibodies against H1N1 were not found [9] . Boars were serologically screened for swine influenza antibodies before they entered boar stations from 1994 [10] until 2009 [11] . During 1997-2007, blood samples from pigs that originated from breeding herds and that were slaughtered from the test stations were tested for H1N1 antibodies [12] .",

The A (H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in Finnish pigs for the first time in November 2009. Before 2008, Finland was considered to be free from swine influenza. According to the results from the samples collected for disease monitoring in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, <0.1%, 0%, and 15.5% of the blood samples were serologically positive for antibodies against H1N1 in the HI test.

Human H3N2 viruses have been recovered from pigs [1] and it is possible that H3N2 seropositive samples were due to infection with human H3N2 viruses and the low H1N2 titers could be explained by reactions to the N2 component. The number of H1N2 and H3N2 positive samples did not increase over time. Therefore they cannot be considered as indication of a true circulation of these viruses in the Finnish pig population.",

Finland is free from Aujeszky's disease [29, 30] . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has never been detected in Finland [31] . Due to additional guarantees for transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) [30] , blood samples are annually monitored for TGE antibodies and crossreactive porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) antibodies, indicating PRCV infection has never been found in Finnish pigs. In addition, freedom from Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has been one of the basic criteria for the national health program for elite breeding herds that started in 1983 [32] , voluntary health classification programs for conventional pig herds launched by several slaughterhouse co-operatives in the 1990s [33, 34] , and the current health classification of pig herds [35] . In 2007, very few sow farms were either M. hyopneumoniae positive or had an unknown status concerning M. hyopneumoniae [36] . Some pig farmers reported short-lasting respiratory signs in pigs in the fall of 2008, when Finland was still considered to be free from swine influenza. Due to the emphasized importance of M. hyopneumoniae in the health classification system and knowledge about the restrictive policy concerning imports of live pigs, sampling and testing at that time were mainly conducted to rule out M. hyopneumoniae infection. Retrospectively, a higher number of H1N1 seropositive samples were found in pigs in herds with clinical signs than in samples of pigs collected for disease monitoring and in samples of pigs in special health class farms. Avian-like swine H1N1 does not necessarily cause coughing in pigs that are free from M. hyopneumoniae infection [37] , and subclinical infections are possible [38, 39] . This could have contributed to the delayed detection of influenza virus in Finland. Virus is expected to be found in the respiratory tract of pigs only during the first week after infection, and paired serum samples are recommended for serology that include a second sampling 3 to 4 weeks after acute disease [1] . Mild and short-lasting clinical signs are also reported in pigs infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [40] . Mild and short-lasting clinical signs may not motivate extensive sampling.",

The first H1N1-positive serum sample of a special health class farm was taken in July 2008. No H1N2 or H3N2 seropositive farms were detected.Diagnostic samplesThe results of samples taken from pigs in farms with clinical signs of acute respiratory disease show that in 2008 seven out of 18 (38,8%) farms tested had H1N1 antibodies. None of the farms had H1N2 or H3N2 antibodies. The first H1N1-seropositive samples were taken in August 2008. All 7 farms where H1N1 antibodies were detected in 2008 were located in 5 adjoining municipalities in Ostrobothnia(Figure 2). In 2009, a total of 24 farms submitted serological samples for antibody testing due to acute respiratory signs. Of these, samples from 13 (54,2%) farms tested positive for H1N1 antibodies. All antibodyor virus-positive farms with respiratory signs were located either in the same area as the positive farms in 2008 or in a separate area in southwest Finland(Figure 2).Virus detectionIn February 2009, the avian-like swine H1N1 influenza A virus (si522/09) was detected for the first time in porcine lung samples from a Finnish farm experiencing respiratory disease in sows and weaned pigs. Soon after that, a similar influenza A virus was detected on two other pig farms (si723/09 and si1563/09) with acute respiratory disease. These farms were localized in the same area. In 2009 and 2010 this swine H1N1 influenza virus was detected on 12 farms and two farms, respectively.TheA(H1N1)pdm09 virus was diagnosed in pigs on one farm in November 2009 and on two farms in 2010 (one in August and one in November).
