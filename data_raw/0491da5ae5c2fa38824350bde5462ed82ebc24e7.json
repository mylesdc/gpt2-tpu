Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters.",

Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E Conclusion: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.",

However, the diversity of gp120 has proven to be a significant challenge to HIV-1 vaccine development. The structure of gp120 contains variable loops (V1-V5) which likely hide critical conserved epitope sites favoured by the Nabs. Furthermore, the crystallography structure of gp120 indicates that the protein is covered by carbohydrates which facilitates viral escape from Nabs [4, 5] . Genetic variability in HIV-gp120 between groups M, N and O also affect the induction of Nabs [6, 7] . These factors complicate the design of an effective candidate vaccine against HIV.",

The question remains: \"can a single immunogen induce a broad immune response against a diverse virus like HIV\". To address this, several studies have been performed. A single and double recombinant HIV-1 gp120 protein has been used as a candidate immunogen in a phase III clinical vaccine trial. However, this vaccination was not effective to protect against HIV infection [10] [11] [12] . This lack of vaccine efficacy may be due to HIV diversity. While some single immunogens neutralize a few T-cell line adapted (TCLA) HIV-1 strains, none of the animal model or clinical studies demonstrated a broadly cross-reactive immunity against HIV-1 primary isolates [13] . Some studies demonstrated neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates, however no measure of cross-reactivity was obtained as the strains of HIV virus used in the Nab assay, contained the same HIV-1 gp120 as that used for vaccination.",

Amplification products corresponding to the full length of gp120 (1.6 kb) containing constant and hypervariable regions were generated by RT-PCR. The genes were completely sequenced and identified as subtype B. The V3 amino acid sequence of the amplified gp120s was compared with V3 subtypes B, C and A/E, point mutations as well as insertion and deletion mutations were detected (Fig 1) . In addition, the phylogenetic relations between the 14 different gp120 sequences and HIV subtypes B, C and A/E were revealed and genetic diversity between clones was identified (Fig 2) . Due to the limited number of nucleotides in the V3 region, the algorithm is applied to a longitudinal data set of the C2-V5 regions of HIV-1 gp120s using Neighbor Tree-Maker in the FASTA format. By this approach, epidemiological linkage was established between the HIV-1 gp120 clones and HIV-1 subtypes B, C and A/E. Most of the HIV-1 gp120 sequences were clustered from the HIV-1 subtype B isolate MN. This isolate was epidemiologically linked to the subtype A/E isolate 93TH975. The results revealed no particular homology between gp120 clones and HIV-1 subtype C isolate 96ZM651. Each gp120 variant was cloned into the pEF6myc-His vector for the expression and purification of recombinant gp120 proteins in vitro. Stable CHO cell lines transfected with the gp120 constructs selected for using blasticidine resistance and recombinant gp120 proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography.

The highest level of antibody titer was observed in hamsters that were immunized with 14 recombinant gp120 proteins. In contrast, the control group (adjuvant alone) did not develop detectable levels of specific antibody responses. Eight weeks after the third immunization, animals were vaccinated again with respective recombinant gp120 proteins. Results similar to the third immunization were observed against gp120 subtypes between the groups. The polyvalent vaccine group induced higher levels of anti-gp120 titers to MN and SF162 (subtypes B) than the subtypes C and A/E (Fig 4) . These results demonstrate that the polyvalent vaccine induces a higher antibody response to subtype B than the single gp120 candidate vaccine.",

Although Nabs have been shown to control some laboratory-adapted strains, these results cannot easily be extended to primary clinical HIV-1 isolates. In addition, induced Nabs from single HIV-1 envelope studies lacked cross-subtype neutralizing activity and could not neutralize other strains of HIV except the strain contained in the vaccine preparation [27] [28] [29] [30] .

For instance, HIV-1 subtype C has enormous genetic differences compared with the recombinant subtypes A/C.

The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS. Following a second wash with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with serially diluted sera. The plates were washed and incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated affinitypurified rabbit anti-hamster secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). After washing, color was developed with O-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride (OPD: Sigma, St. Louise, MO). The color reaction was stopped with 1 N HCl and absorbance was read at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). antibody assay Neutralization was measured as a function of reduction in luciferase reporter gene expression after a single round of infection in TZM-bl cells. TZM-bl cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, as contributed by John Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu. Briefly, 200 TCID50 of virus was incubated with serial 3-fold dilutions of serum sample in triplicate in a total volume of 150 \u00b5l for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. Freshly trypsinized TZM-bl cells (10,000 cells in 100 \u00b5l of growth medium containing 75 \u00b5g/ml DEAE dextran) were added to each well. Indinavir was added at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M to prevent virus replicaton in the case of HIV-1 MN. One set of control wells received cells + virus (virus control) and another set received cells only (background control). After a 48 hour incubation, 100 \u00b5l of cells was transferred to 96-well black solid plates (Corning Costar, Rochester, NY) for measurement of luminescence using Bright Glo substrate solution as described by the supplier (Promega, Madison WI). An assay stock of HIV-1 MN was prepared in H9 cells. Assays stocks of Env-pseudotyped viruses were prepared by tranfection in 293T cells. All virus stocks were made cell-free by 0.45-micron filtration and were stored at -70\u00b0C until use.",
