Microarrays are particularly attractive for the recognition of pathogens in clinical material since current diagnostic assays are typically restricted to the detection of single targets by real-time PCR or immunological assays. Furthermore, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of these signatures can require downstream sequencing of genomic regions. Many microarrays have already been produced with the aim of characterizing the spectrum of microorganisms present in a sample, including detection of known viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , assessment of bioterrorism [6, 7] and monitoring food quality [8] .",

There are a huge number of diverse species in nature, of which we have sequence information for only a tiny fraction. This makes it difficult to find oligonucleotides, either alone or in combination, that uniquely identify species of interest. Oligos may have homology to multiple species, which results in a complex and noisy hybridization pattern. Secondly, each nucleic acid sample tested will typically contain a mixture of DNA and RNA from the organism of interest, the host and from a variety of contaminants, which may all contribute to the resulting microarray profile. Furthermore, this may be complicated by the presence of multiple, possibly related, pathogen species, making it difficult to separate patterns due to cross-hybridization from a true positive result.",

Observed hybridization profiles are then compared to the theoretical profiles using a similarity metric, and a p value calculated using a set of experimentally obtained null probability distributions. E-Predict has been shown to produce useful results in a number of situations. However, at present, E-Predict does not contain any tools for visualization, and requires extensive customization and calculation before it is applicable to new arrays.

There are 24 distinct groups of human rhinoviruses represented on the array, including a group of oligos for all members ('human rhinovirus sp.), one each for human rhinovirus A and B, and several groups for distinct serotypes. Human rhinovirus 28 is not one of those serotypes specifically targeted by the array; however, as a serotype of the human rhinovirus A species, we would expect the groups for human rhinovirus sp. and human rhinovirus A to be prevalent amongst the results. As can be seen from Table 3 , the top hit from DetectiV is human rhinovirus sp., closely followed by human rhinovirus A, the expected result. The reason we have highlighted this array, however, is that the result for Enterobacteria phage M13 shows a higher mean normalized intensity than any of the rhinovirus groups. This is representative of a class of result from DetectiV whereby a virus group has a higher mean normalized log ratio, but a larger p value, than the top hit. Here, as in GSM40806, we see orders of magnitude between the p value for the top hit and that for Enterobacteria phage M13, which identifies human rhinovirus as being the infectious agent, but in this case we cannot rely on the mean normalized intensity. In this particular instance, Enterobacteria phage M13 is represented by 10 oligos, all of which have intensities far greater than the global median, but which vary considerably between 982 and 18,864.

This represents the final class of result seen by DetectiV, where the correct virus group does not have the smallest p value, but does have a much larger mean normalized log ratio than those groups that have smaller p values. The small p value of respiratory syncytial virus combined with the large mean normalized log ratio identifies respiratory syncytial virus as the only infectious agent. In this instance, human herpesvirus 5 is represented by 241 oligos, 167 of which are greater than the global median, but all of which have intensities less than 1,000.

For certain species it is impossible to find a large number of oligos that are unique only to that virus that meet the criteria for oligo selection. This is particularly problematic for closely related species and strains. In such cases, the 'best' oligos are added to the array, in the knowledge that multiple viruses may hybridize to them. This leads to noisy signals across multiple virus families, species and serotypes. Secondly, infected biological samples may contain many different virus species and strains, making interpretation difficult. Thirdly, it is known that certain oligos simply do not work, even when the array is hybridized with the species that those oligos were designed to. Without testing the array with each virus, we are incapable at present of predicting which oligos will work and which will not. With thousands of species per array, many of which cannot be cultured in vitro, it is unfeasible to challenge arrays with every species. Finally, we of course do not know, nor can we ever know, the complete genome sequence of every virus we may encounter. Therefore, though we think we have oligos unique to a species or strain, that is only ever in the context of our knowledge at the time of design, and they may not in fact be unique.",

Initial methods included visual inspection of the array [4] and clustering [18] , both of which are subjective and time-consuming. To combat this, Urisman et al. [9] have proposed a more robust method, E-Predict. E-Predict utilizes a pre-calculated energy matrix for each oligo on the array and uses a variety of normalization and similarity metrics to calculate a p value and similarity for each virus. The advantages of E-Predict are that it is quantitative, produces good results and is extensible, through the extension of the energy matrix. The disadvantages of the software are a lack of visualization tools, the need to customize parameters for different array platforms and hybridization conditions, and the availability of the software only as a CGI script on the Unix/Linux platform.",

Data can then normalized to a negative control (be that a specific probe, array or the global median), transformed by taking the log2 and then subjected to a t-test for each species on the array.

A statistically significant result may be obtained by a group of oligos that display intensities only marginally larger than the negative control (in this case the global median intensity). This is demonstrated by human herpesvirus 5 on array GSM40820 (Table 3) . However, we know that from a biological perspective, we would expect to see intensities far higher than the negative control, and that intensities only marginally higher result from low homology between the probe and the sample. We can therefore use the statistical significance (p value) in combination with our idea of biological significance (the mean normalized log ratio) to successfully call the correct result in over 98% of the arrays.",

When using DetectiV, it is only when looking for major changes between the top hit and subsequent hits, in terms of p value or mean log ratio, that it is possible to separate the true positives from the false positives. In many cases, using automatic rules will result in the correct result; however, there will inevitably be borderline cases where human inspection of the results is required. This is all the more important when considering the possible economic impacts of a false positive for certain species.

On application of DetectiV to the updated data, SARS was the top hit. Not only does this offer the promise of being able to extend the coverage of the array without adding further oligos, it also suggests that it is possible to detect viruses without having any unique oligos.

It may be that we can apply a similar method here to shrink the standard error for each virus species towards a common value, thus increasing sensitivity. It may also be possible to apply multiple-testing procedures to the resulting p values. The Bonferroni correction may be appropriate, in which the p values are multiplied by the number of comparisons, or a more conservative approach may be needed, such as that suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [19] , in order to control the false discovery rate.",
