            "text": "Notwithstanding these successes, docking retains crucial liabilities. As it is used to screen increasingly large compound libraries for new candidate ligands, the speed of the docking calculations has remained a goal for optimization. The need for efficient docking programs has become more pressing as the size of the accessible compound libraries has risen. Whereas docking campaigns in the early 1990s addressed libraries like the Fine Chemical Directory (MDL) of about 60,000 molecules, and the Available Chemicals Directory of about 250,000 molecules in the early 2000s, the advent of ZINC and related databases [66, 67] increased the number of purchasable molecules for screening to over 700,000 in 2005 and to almost 20,000,000 molecules of molecular mass less than 500 daltons today [68] . More crucial still is the need for sufficient sampling of ligand and protein states in docking, and of accurate evaluation of the binding energies of potential protein-ligand complexes. Conformational space grows exponentially with ligand size, and sampling this space remains challenging. A key issue is whether docking is sampling sufficiently, and how increased sampling relates to improved scoring and outcomes. This includes sampling the internal degrees of freedom within the ligand as well as sampling ligand poses between the ligand and the protein receptor.",

            "text": "Several widely-used docking methods have been introduced to address these problems, and to exploit the opportunities that large compound libraries present for the discovery of new ligands. The program FRED [69] exhaustively samples geometries defined by a regular latice, filters using pharmacophores, and then evaluates the remaining poses with an energy function. ICM [70] uses multiple stochastic runs to sample poses to be scored with an energy function, while GOLD [71] uses a genetic algorithm to sample poses and includes a variety of scoring functions. GLIDE SP [72] uses several levels of sampling and scoring, ending with a modified version of ChemScore with ten scoring terms [73] , and GLIDE XP [74] uses eighty parameters for scoring and is trained to reproduce binding affinity data for known complexes. Autodock 4 [75] and Autodock Vina [76] are different versions of the same grid-based energy approach with a genetic algorithm to sample poses. The DOCK series of programs have typically focused on physics-based scoring functions with relatively few terms and sampling by graph-matching between ligand atoms and receptor ''hot-spots''-points of likely complementarity for a particular ligand atom. There are two main branches of DOCK, the DOCK 6.x [77] and DOCK 3.x families, of which the former has focused more on accurate prediction of ligand geometries and adopted a wider range of scoring functions. Meanwhile, the DOCK 3.x programs have cleaved more tightly to physics-based scoring functions with fewer terms, and have focused on optimizing for the speed necessary to tackle large library screens. It is the latter program that has been most extensively tested by experiment for new ligand discovery, and is among the docking programs most thoroughly tested by direct comparison to prospective HTS, and crystallographic confirmation, at least in the literature.",

            "text": "DOCK3.5.54 managed a relatively rapid screening of chemical libraries by efficient sampling of possible orientations and by use of a flexibase [78] of pre-calculated ligand conformations [79, 80] . The former relied on an implementation of DOCK's traditional hotspot-based graph matching [81, 82] which focused the search for complementary ligand orientations to the protein likely to lead to favorable fits, while the latter eliminated the need to build ligand conformations on the fly, especially useful when docking the same ligand to multiple proteins as the time is saved for additional screens beyond the first. As we tried to optimize the program further, however, we found that the sampling of orientations behaved erratically as parameters were varied. When using histograms to limit the sampling, the orientations sampled were always a subset of what was possible at any given distance tolerance. Changing the histogram parameters always returned different possible graph clique matches, but did not return subsets or supersets of the possible orientations made by other histogram parameters, leading to confusion when trying to explore and optimize orientational sampling. Similarly we were concerned about the sampling of ligand conformations in the flexibase. The main issue was with the recombination of different conformations generated by OMEGA [83] into new conformations, which had the potential to create internal steric clashes. These conformations were often present in DOCK3.5.54 [79, 80] library screens. A scheme to filter for conformations without internal clashes in DOCK3.6 [84] was not entirely satisfactory, as these strained geometries were still generated and the filters were not entirely successful, leading to effectively good scoring decoy conformations. Additionally, problems with conformations in the flexibase to be docked, such as the sampling of aromatic hydroxyls out of plane, introduced further erors.",

We adapt an exhaustive graph-matching technique [85, 86 ] that ensures we sample all possible matching graph cliques. By graph cliques we mean superpositions of sets of ligand atoms on sets of receptor hot-spots ( Figure 1A) . Now, as we increase the amount of matches, ligand orientation sampling grows regularly, predictably and nonstochastically. This allows us to explore how, and if, increased ligand sampling leads to better docking performance, as judged by energies and enrichment of known ligands over matched decoys. This is crucial to understanding whether our core challenges in docking are sampling or scoring. We further explore whether physically improved calculations of ligand geometry, using an electrostatic term in the ligand conformation generation, as well as more realistic sampling of aromatic hydroxyls, leads to better docking performance. Alert to the need for efficiency in a method that seeks to rank order the protein complementarity of 20,000,000 unrelated molecules, we also explored software engineering for efficient docking, which ultimately improved the raw speed of the method. What results is a docking method whose sampling increases regularly and predictably while retaining its physics-based energy calculation and speed: on common 2.66 GHz cores, it can reliably dock the 1,400,000 compound library used in DUD-E [87] in as little as 1000 CPU hours. Given the ready accessibility of multi-core clusters, this speed allows us to test DOCK stringently using different parameters, on the DUD-E library of 102 diverse protein targets with a total of 22,805 ligands and 1,411,214 property-matched decoys. Several of the methods here may find wide application. The new program is called DOCK3.7 [88] and incorporates updates to the DOCK source code, the flexibase generation program mol2db2 (an update of mol2 db [79, 80] ), blastermaster (an updated DOCK Blaster [89] ) and other accessory scripts. DOCK remains available as a free download, with source for all our programs, for academics and nonprofit research institutions. A web-based implementation for those interested in using it for ligand discovery without investing in a local installation is also available [90] .",

            "text": "Our first goal was to make the sampling of ligand orientations in DOCK3.7 regular, non-stochastic, and smoothly variable. The DOCK programs have used a graph matching strategy since the program's first inception [81] , mapping ligand atoms onto receptor hot-spots, regions where ligand atoms are likely to bind. In this scheme, hot-spots and atoms are matched based on internal distances. In the DOCK3.x program series, an effort to speed and focus this matching had led to irregular sampling, which made performance hard to anticipate as variables were changed and made it impossible to smoothly increase orientation sampling, reproduce results or optimize docking performance. To overcome this problem, the algorithm was upgraded to use full graph matching instead of using histogram binning to reduce the number of orientational matches found [82] (Figure 1 ). Full distance matrices are now used in place of histograms that reduced the number of potential matches and, therefore, orientations. In this way, we use a single parameter to control how many orientational matches are desired, much like that used in DOCK4.0 [86, 91] . We do not specify a minimum internal distance parameter; it made sense when entire small molecules were being matched, but the current DOCK architecture matches only rigid rings [78] [79] [80] , allowing the rest of the molecule encoded in the flexibase hierarchy to move with respect to that rigid ring positioned in the binding site. We use an adaptive system where a desired number of matches is specified, as well as a minimum, maximum and increment of the distance tolerance. The latter three parameters are unchanged throughout all these tests and chosen to start very low (0.05\u00c5 ) and grow slowly with each iteration, allowing the first parameter of desired number of orientational matches to control the docking run. In this way, the orientational matches found with a match goal of 1000 orientations include all the matches found with a lesser match goal. Increasing the sampling by changing this desired number of match goals parameter will always find all of the old poses as well as additional poses. Correspondingly, increasing the match goal always maintains or improves the score of any docked molecule ( Figure 2) . Also, the orientations tested are always identical-the algorithm is deterministic and non-random at all parts of the sampling.",

Though every docked molecule will find a better scoring pose with a higher level of sampling, a situation where decoys find better poses relative to the ligands would decrease the performance in terms of enrichment. For 13 PDB [92] structures of Glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 1 (GRIK1) (1VSO, 2F34, 2F35, 2PBW, 2QS1, 2QS2, 2QS3, 2WKY, 3C31, 3GBA, 3GBB, 3S2V, 4DLD), the ligands were extracted and compared to their docked poses based on the heavy atom root mean square deviation (RMSD) using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [77] to account for symmetry. With these 13 ligands, as sampling was increased from 50 through 20000 match goals, the mean RMSD went from 3.1 \u00c5 to 2.7 \u00c5 to 2.6 \u00c5 to 2.9 \u00c5 to 3.0\u00c5 . By this criterion, although docking scores always improved with sampling, RMSD to crystallographic poses did not. However, when we quantified the correctness of the docked poses by defining a set of critical contact atoms, judged to be important in the ligand binding to the protein by being present in most, if not all, of the ligands, matters improved. Three atoms; two carboxylate oxygens and an amide nitrogen, were chosen; the carboxylate atoms interact with Arg95 and Thr90, the amide nitrogen interacts with Thr90, Pro88 and Glu190 of GRIK1 ( Figure 3A ). For the docked DUD-E ligands of GRIK1 the median critical contact RMSD drops from 3.9 \u00c5 to 2.8 \u00c5 to 2.2 \u00c5 to 2.1 \u00c5 to 1.9 \u00c5 as orientational sampling increases from 50 to 20000. 86 of the 99 docked known ligands showed a decreased critical contact RMSD as orientational sampling increased ( Figure 3 ).",

Adjusted logAUC is the area under the ROC curve, where the x-axis is logarithmic to favor early ligand enrichment, combining the strengths of the AUC and EF1 metrics. The area under a random curve is subtracted from the logAUC so that an adjusted logAUC of zero represents random enrichment, while positive numbers represent enrichment of ligands over physically-matched decoys. As orientational sampling is increased from 50 to 500 to 2000 to 5000 to 20000 poses, the mean adjusted logAUC for all DUD-E systems rises from 13.1 to 14.7 to 16.0 to 16.6 to 17.4 (the same monotonic trends are apparent for linear AUC and for EF1, Tables S3 and S4). Thus, the mean over 102 protein targets with more thorough sampling of ligand orientions leads to better docking performance, as judged by enrichment of many known ligands over many more property matched decoys. This was not something we could previously investigate in a regularly variable manner.",

When examined, the ligands find better energies ( Figure 5A ) and the poses get better, as judged by critical contact RMSD, but the decoys improve even more in energy than do the ligands.

We found that four flags led to measurable increases in performance, with several increasing speed by between 2% and 26% (Table 1) ; overall, compiler optimization improved speed by 41%. A second major improvement came from optimizing energy scoring grids. These grids pre-compute receptor energy potential functions, such as van der Waals and Poisson-Boltzmann-derived electrostatic potentials. These grid potentials, combined with an atomic property like atom type or charge, are multipled into energies. In this way, each atom is scored for each of the energy functions desired. To look up grid potentials for ligand atoms that do not fall precisely on a lattice point, trilinear interpolation is used between neighboring points for atoms that fall in-between lattice points, as most do. Such interpolation at run time turns out to be costly, but we found that we could pre-compute large portions of the calculation before docking began, saving substantial calculation time when scoring, at the cost of memory usage. Further time was saved aligning continuously in memory all 8 precomputed values associated with every trilinear interpolation cube for the cache controller. For instance, with the optimized interpolation we can look up over 1 million atom grid scores per second in the GRIK1 system, whereas before optimization only 300,000 grid lookups per second were performed ( Table 2 ). As this step was rate determining for many systems, it contributed substantially to the 2.5 to 3-fold overall speed-up realized for the optimized code over the DOCK3.5.54 code (Table 2) . Because most docking programs [72, 75, 76, 81, 85, [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] use a grid-based approach for at least initial scoring, such a stratagem may be widely applicable.",

As described above, ligand enrichment against decoys across the DUD-E systems already achieves an adjusted logAUC of 13, or an EF1 of 11.6, at a match goal of 50 orientations. At an orientation goal of 500, the adjusted logAUC and EF1 values improve to 14.8 and 12.8, respectively, and further rises as matches rise further. A point of diminishing returns is eventually reached, undoubtedly because the higher orientation numbers are achieved by lower stringency matching of atoms to receptor hotspots, leading to poorer correspondence between the ligand atoms and the receptor hot-spots. If we take 500 ligand orientations as a sensible level of sampling, screening 1.5 million molecules in the lead-like available-now set in ZINC [68] would require about 2700 hours on a single core (about one ligand every 5 seconds). If this remains a substantial investment, it is less than two days on a small cluster of 100 cores, and an afternoon on a cluster of 1000 cores, a size that is increasingly common. If one wanted to take on a larger number of systems, it is a simple matter to reduce the orientation sampling goal for the program-a goal of 50 orientations, which still performs relatively well against the DUD-E set, would only demand 1.5 hours to screen 6.6 million lead-like compounds against a single representative target for a 1000 core cluster.",

This likely reflects the greater likelihood of finding productive poses using higher-stringency of the lower matching goal; the more productive poses that are calculated, the more time that must be spent in scoring them, as clashing poses are quickly discarded.

They are, however, important, as high energy conformations are essentially decoys that can obscure the presence of more favorable poses. Among the features that can contribute to such high-energy ligand conformations is the neglect of electrostatic energies in ligand conformations, which are often ignored owing to concerns about overweighting the term in an effectively low dielectric calculation [100] (Figure 7) . Indeed, conformations that neglected electrostatics have been previously used for all molecules in the ZINC [101, 102] DUD [103] and DUD-E [87] ligands databases (since in the DOCK3.x programs ligand conformations are pre-calculated and docked as a flexibase, relatively expensive ligand calculations are affordable). To explore the effect of the electrostatic term on docking, we re-built all ligands and decoys for all DUD-E systems with both the MMFF94S [104] forcefield in OMEGA [83, 105] and with the MMFF94S_noestat forcefield, where electrostatics are turned off. To our knowledge, this is the first time this has been attempted on such a large scale (over 1.4 million ligands and decoys), and the first time it has been judged by docking all the resulting conformations and computing enrichments.",

However, in the 40% of targets where enrichment diminished, it diminished further than it had increased in the 60% of the systems where it improved. The mean enrichment over DUD-E was essentially zero ( Figure 8E , green bars). On inspection, many of the systems where performance declined on adding electrostatics to the ligand conformational energy calculation had charged ligands leading to relatively high-magnitude contributions to the conformational energy from the electrostatic term. This is important because we only calculate conformations within a certain energy window, which is arbitrarily set [100] , but as the absolute magnitude of the energies of the conformations rises, so will the difference between them, and so too should the energy window (Figure 7) . These effects were explored in a subset of 17 DUD-E targets (ACE, ACES, ANDR, COMT, DPP4, DYR, FA10, FA7, FABP4, FPPS, GRIK1, PYRD, THRB, TRY1, TRYB1, UROK, XIAP). Increasing the energy window from 12.5 to 15 kcal/mol for conformations built with internal electrostatics increased enrichment by a mean of 1.0 logAUC units. Increasing the energy window further still, to 30 kcal/mol, improved mean logAUC by 3 units. Overall, of these 17 DUD-E targets, 12 were rescued by the increase in the energy window during ligand the ligand building procedure ( Figure 8E, black bars) . Taken together, these results support the use of ligand internal electrostatics in conformation calculation, which has, moreover, the added benefit of being physically more realistic.",

The latter improved the adjusted logAUC by 0.78 to 0.88 across the 29 DUD-E targets, depending on number of orientations sampled; five systems showed much higher improvement ( Figure 10 ).

Previously, to save disk space, the molecular library had been represented in a format that sacrificed ligand topology, among other features, for a highly compressed format that could support the millions of molecules and billions of conformations in a typical lead-like or drug-like docking library from ZINC [79, 80] . With the increased disk capacity of modern computer systems this is no longer necessary. By storing full atom and bond information, the flexibase may now be directly understood and interrogated, and the docked output has lost none of the information of the original mol2 file and may be readily converted to other formats [108] . Correspondingly, fields have been added to the output to support anticipated new directions in scoring and docking information, such as weighting ligands by internal energies that we are now beginning to calculate. Additionally, the scoring breakdown for each atom and for each scoring term can be written to the output file, enabling further analysis and visualization. Finally, multiple topscoring poses per molecule may now be written out, not only the very top-scoring pose as was previously the case. This will often enable a much richer investigation of the docking results, and the consideration of ensemble energies; it is limited only by memory and disk space.",

First, once we regularize our sampling of orientations, it becomes apparent that increased energies for ligands and decoys for that target. B & D) Protein Farnesyltransferase/Geranylgeranyltransferase Type I Alpha Subunit (FNTA), where the logAUC does not change significantly with increased orientational sampling, again the difference between the ligand and decoy energies is shown above in the upper right. E), GRIK1 is shown, where the logAUC goes up with increased orientational sampling. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0075992.g005 sampling of poses improves docking performance. This is supported both by enrichment of ligands over decoys and by capturing canonical interactions. Second, this algorithmic change was accompanied by code optimization-using techniques that may be widely applicable-that increased the speed of the program three-fold; this will be important as the field takes on ever-more ambitious library screening campaigns. Third, improving our physical treatment of ligand conformations-including internal electrostatics energies when building them, and insisting on low-energy rotamers for aromatic hydroxyl hydrogens-not only improved overall performance, but did so in a way that establishes a foundation for further development of physics-based scoring in molecular docking. A longstanding concern in not only ligand docking but in other modeling techniques, such as protein comparative modeling, is whether increased sampling will necessarily improve performance. After all, if the scoring functions have serious liabilities it could well be that increased sampling will simply exploit these, leading to better scoring but worse enrichment, owing to decoy molecules scoring even better than the true ligands. Broadly this was not what we observed: despite the well-known liabilities in docking scoring functions, in three quarters of the 102 DUD-E targets enrichment rose with greater sampling. This suggests that the scoring function, with all of its gaps, approximations, and errors, is capturing important aspects of ligand recognition, even in the face of a benchmarking set where every ligand is matched with 50 property-matched decoys. Admittedly, performance remains far from perfect: in 23 DUD-E targets enrichment did not rise with greater orientation sampling, and in almost all of the 102 targets improvements in enrichment plateaued after about 2000 orientations had been sampled. This reflects the limitations on our current scoring function.",

For instance, a longstanding goal in chemical biology has been to screen the world's chemistry against all of the pharmacologically relevant targets. This remains infeasible for empirical screening, but it is feasible, even today, for docking. To dock the 2 million ZINC lead-like available-now compounds against the 3000 or so pharmacologically interesting targets for which structures are available, with 50 orientations sampled per ligand, would demand about seven months for a 1000 core cluster, which is no longer considered a large cluster in the field.",

Using a bump limit based on van der Waals score to prune out bad, repulsive conformations can double the speed of the docking procedure, similar to the ideas of dead-end elimination or A* searching from computer science [113] . These lessons will guide future users of DOCK3.7 but could be applied to all docking software and systems. In building ligands, we concluded that careful attention should be paid to hydroxyl positions. Even though they may seem small, they can matter a great deal for some targets in terms of enrichment. The final lesson for building ligands is that the full MMFF94S force field can and should be used, as it improves most systems. These lessons for building ligands will be applied in future releases of ZINC [102] , but are also relevant for anyone building large collections of ligands for future docking.",

Other procedures for computing partial charges of ligand atoms and ligand desolvation terms besides AMSOL [116] , like QEQUIL [117] , PDB2PQR [118] or AM1BCC [119] , could be tested. Also, since building the ligands for these systems is a timeconsuming process, once built many docking parameters and code changes can be explored and examined on a fast basis. The code can dock all ligands and decoys to their DUD-E targets in as few as 11 hours, but longer and more extensive tests take thousands of hours. On a cluster of 500 computers, a full set of tests at high levels of orientational sampling take as little as 8 hours; as computers get faster and clusters grow, this time will only come down.",

The 102 DUD-E targets were prepared here in a completely automatic fashion from PDB codes [89] , and the automatic docking procedure was improved and will also be an area of future improvement.

The be-blasti routine of DOCK Blaster was used to download the PDB codes for each DUD-E target [87] , the list of ligands, cofactors and ions was modified to correctly account for all targets in DUD-E without intervention. Previous methods for protonation of sidechains have been replaced with REDUCE [121] as it was the most adaptable program, capable of protonating only sidechains that are requested and to not move heavy atoms during the protonation procedure. CHEMGRID [122] is used to make the van der Waals grid using an AMBER forcefield [123] for the receptor; SOLV-MAP [93] is used to calculate a ligand desolvation grid. Proteinligand electrostatics is calculated using QNIFFT [124, 125] , a version of DelPhi [126] . QNIFFT improved performance on DUD [103] slightly as compared to preparations with DelPhi, likely due to the increased default grid size of 193 from 179. SPHGEN and related programs are used to place the receptor spheres used in the matching routine [81] . The general pipeline for placing matching spheres is to use the crystallographic ligand heavy atoms as the first set of spheres and to add nearby spheres generated by SPHGEN until a set number is reached, for further details see [89] . Cofactor parameters were taken from previous versions of DUD [103] and DUD-E [87] as is, except for the parameters for the COMT cofactor S-adenosylmethionine, which were modified to properly protonate the sulfur moeity. All parts of the new protein target preparation script are written in Python.",

Many of the steps here were identical to the steps in the ZINC processing pipeline [101, 102] . CORINA [127] is used to produce an initial 3D conformation from input SMILES, AMSOL is used to compute partial charges and ligand desolvation terms [116] , and OMEGA [83, 105] is used to enumerate multiple 3D conformations. The biggest changes are to the procedure for collecting flexible ligands for use during docking. Previously, mol2db [79, 80] , an implementation of the flexibase concept [78] , was used to collect ligand conformations for docking. The flexibase concept, in short, uses a collection of conformations built around a single rigid component, often a ring, to represent ligand flexibility. In mol2db, each part of the molecule stemming from the rigid component was independent, which represented a speedup in terms of time, but many conformations found during with DOCK 3.5.54 [79, 80] were energetically unrealistic, often internally clashing. DOCK 3.6 [84, 93, 106] avoided this problem by implementing runtime clash checking to find a slightly worse pose, as judged by docking score, but one that did not have an internal clash. However, this procedure was limited to simple distance checks and often still produced bad poses.",

The new hierarchy format tracks the input conformations, and only docks complete input conformations instead of ones that have been pieced together from different input conformations. In early testing on the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) [103] , we found that some targets needed additional input conformations represented in order to appropriately sample the target. For this reason, the new pipeline uses a lower RMSD cutoff in OpenEye OMEGA [83, 105] (0.4 \u00c5 now as opposed to 0.8\u00c5 ) and more output conformations (2000 versus 600) than before.",

As DOCK 3.6 before it, DOCK 3.7 uses the libfgz C library to read and write gzipped files. Many algorithmic details have been updated in this process. The new db2 file format is used as input to DOCK 3.7, preserving input conformations, atom typing and bond information. This allows valid mol2 files to be generated as output. The histogram binning steps of the matching algorithm [82] have been removed in favor of a complete matching algorithm in the style of DOCK4 [86] . Orientations of the ligand into the receptor can be generated using a single parameter of distance tolerance-the difference between the distances between the matched pair of points. A more tolerant parameter leads to more matches (and therefore more orientations of the ligand in the receptor) but always includes the matches found with a lower distance threshold. Ligand matching spheres are heavy atom positions of atoms in the rigid component. Receptor matching spheres can be specified by any positions within the binding site. During automated docking preparation [89] , receptor spheres are placed at the crystallographic ligand heavy atom coordinates and at other nearby ''hotspots'' identified by SPHGEN [81] . As before, limits can be placed on how many distances must match before an orientation is generated. Throughout this work, four was the minimum and maximum number necessary, requiring that all 6 distances specified by the four points at the corners of tetrahedra are within the distance tolerance.",
