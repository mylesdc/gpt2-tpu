            "text": "To investigate CTL epitope applications in swine, SLA-1 * 1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free (SPF) swine experiments. First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1 * 1502 (pSLA-1 * 1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1 * 1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1 * 1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1 * 0401 and pSLA-3 * hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1 * 1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1 * 1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1 * 1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1 * 1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1 * 1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-\u03b3 expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.",

            "text": "The development of new viral vaccines should be increasingly focused on biosafety, especially to remove the viral genetic material and to avoid the possibility of recombinant viruses developing due to the use of vaccines. In view of this central idea, diverse viral vaccines, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitope vaccines, have been experimentally researched in animals for the ongoing control of viral diseases and immunological deficiency diseases (1) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine pathogens and has caused significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide for two decades (2) . PRRSV is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus with a viral genome of \u223c15 kb in length and contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (3) . ORFs 1a and 1b are situated 5 \u2032proximal to the polycistronic genome and encode two large non-structural replicase polyproteins, pp1a, and pp1b, which are processed into at least 14 non-structural proteins (nsps). Eight relatively small genes following ORF1 in the 5 \u2032 to 3 \u2032 direction encode four membrane-associated glycoproteins, three membrane proteins, and a nucleocapsid protein. Progress has been made in identifying nsp function related to RNA synthesis (nsp9 and nsp10), subgenomic mRNA synthesis regulation (nsp1), membrane-rearrangement (nsp2 and nsp3), replicative endonuclease (nsp11), major virulence factors (nsp3- 8) , and viral pathogenesis and host immunity (nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp11) (4) . The frequent mutation and recombination of the PRRSV RNA genome have resulted in the emergence of numerous variants (5, 6) . These phenomena can cause the emergence of some virulent strains, such as the highly pathogenic PRRSVs that are causing enormous economic losses in Asia (7) , and have led to the failure of vaccines against new emerging PRRSVs. There are considerable challenges and specific requirements in the development of novel vaccines to prevent PRRS, such as the CTL-epitope vaccine (8, 9) .",

            "text": "The greatest challenge is that PRRSV can markedly suppress the swine immune defense system (10) . The current evaluation of the PRRSV vaccine is based on its induced antibody response. Although high antibody titers can be produced after immunization, protection is not ideal because the key neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against PRRSV appear late, typically >28 days post-infection (dpi), and usually at low levels (11) . Furthermore, NAbs are usually specific for the homologous PRRSV strain and confer little cross-protection against heterologous strains (12, 13) . Regarding CTL-mediated immunity, specific CTL responses have been observed in PRRSV (10, 14, 15) . The virulent type 1 (Lena) PRRSV resulted in increased IL-1\u03b1 production and a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells and IFN\u03b3-producing cells compared with controls. Cross-reactivity against divergent PRRSV is also associated with cytotoxic CD8+IFN\u03b3 and CD8-IFN\u03b3+ cells to a different extent (9) . PRRSV-specific T cells could be observed as early as 2 weeks after infection, with the viral loads decreasing in persistent infection (13) . Modified live vaccines (MLVs) could induce CTL immune responses and confer better protection against heterologous PRRSV strains than inactivated PRRS vaccines (16) . These findings indicate that specific CD8 + CTL immunity may play an important role in controlling PRRSV infection. However, there is limited clear and direct evidence of CTLs eliminating PRRSV infection, and more basic immune reagents, such as the tetramer of swine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I with PRRSV peptide epitope, are required to address these important issues (9) .",

There are three classical SLA-I loci (SLA-1, SLA-2, and SLA-3) in the swine genome, and all are dominantly expressed (17) . SLA-I molecules can present viral peptide epitopes to swine CD8 + T cells and induce the CTL response to kill the infected cells (18) . Similar to human MHC (also known as human leukocyte antigen, HLA), SLA-I molecules are a highly polymorphic gene superfamily whose peptide-binding specificities are significantly influenced by highly variable sites (17) . Thus, far, more than 100 SLA-I genes have been cloned (IPD; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/index.html), and two three-dimensional (3D) structures of peptide-SLA-I (p/SLA-I) molecules have been determined, revealing the peptide presentation characteristics of SLA-I molecules in swine (19, 20) . Thus, the situation is favorable for the design and development of a novel viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS based on these 3D structures of SLA-I molecules.",

For initial immunization, the MLV and MLV+NSP9-TMP9 groups were injected with an attenuated PRRSV vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelvac). After seven days, for the second immunization, the MLV + NSP9-TMP9 group was injected with the NSP9-TMP9 peptide mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 1:3 emulsification). The MLV group was injected with the MLV peptide mixed with CFA. Seven days later, peptide mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA, 1:3 emulsification) was injected into the MLV+NSP9-TMP9 group. The MLV group was injected with MLV mixed with IFA. The immune dose of the peptide was 0.1 mg/kg body weight. The control group was injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), deionized water mixed with CFA (1:3 emulsification), and deionized water mixed with IFA (1:3 emulsification) at the same time as the immunization group. Equivalent volumes were used in the immunization group and the control group. Blood was collected from the anterior vena cava, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio).

The cells were then washed once with staining buffer and detected via flow cytometry. More than 10 6 cell events were acquired for each sample. Cells stained with PE-labeled tetramers and a FITC-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody were counted as CTL response cells (31) .

Previous studies on SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202 showed that the residue at position 156 plays a key role in peptide binding by fixing the P3 residue with a salt bridge or hydrogen bond (Figures 4C,D) . In contrast, no salt bridge or hydrogen bond forms between the P3-Pro of NSP9-TMP9 and Met 156 of SLA-1 * 1502.",

            "text": "To determine the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1 * 1502, the peptide NSP9-TMP9 was mutated by alanine scanning (19) , and CD spectra were used to test the stability of pSLA-1 * 1502 complexes with these mutant peptides ( Figure 5) . The in vitro refolding and CD results showed that the binding stabilities of P2-Ala, P3-Ala, and P9-Ala mutant peptides are significantly lower than that of the wild-type NSP9-TMP9 peptide. Although P3-Pro cannot form a hydrogen bond or salt bridge with the D pocket of SLA-1 * 1502, its Ala mutant still impairs the stability of the pSLA-1 * 1502 complex. According to these results, the P2, P3, and P9 residues are the primary anchor residues of the epitope peptides presented by SLA-1 * 1502. The B, D and F pockets accommodate these primary anchor residues and determine the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1 * 1502, similar to SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202. The B and F pockets accommodate the P2 and P9 anchor residues of the binding peptide, respectively, and their preference for P2 and P9 anchor residues is determined by their amino acid composition. Figure 2 shows the pocket composition of SLA-1 * 1502. Figure 3 shows that the amino acid composition of the B and F pockets of SLA-1 * 1502 is very similar to that of SLA-1 * 0401. Differential amino acids are found only at one or two individual sites and do not form direct contacts with the side chains of the P2 or P9 residues of the binding peptide. Because of the similar B and F pockets, the P2 and P9 residues of the SLA-1 * 1502-binding peptides should be the same as in the SLA-1 * 0401 peptides. The SLA-1 * 0401 binding peptide (20) and the SLA-1 * 1502 binding peptide have a large overlap at the P2 and P9 residues ( Table 1 ). The B pocket of SLA-1 * 1502 accommodates multiple uncharged residues, while the F pocket mainly binds Phe, Tyr and Trp. The in vitro refolding results for the peptides supported this reasonable speculation ( Table 1) . The uncharged D pocket of SLA-1 * 1502 might accommodate various uncharged P3 residues, unlike those of SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202. Peptides with P3-Ala cannot provide sufficient affinity, unlike larger amino acids, such as L, M, F, S, N, and P ( Table 1 ). In summary, the preliminary peptide-binding motif of SLA-1 * 1502 is expected to contain the following combination: X-(S/M/F/W/T/V/I/L)-(L/P/M/F/S/N)-X-X-X-X-X-(F/Y/W). The predicted peptide epitopes derived from whole protein sequences of four typical PRRSV strains were screened: the first isolated strain, VR2332; the low-virulence strain HB-13.9; the highly pathogenic strain JXwn06; and the CHsx1401 strain, which was responsible for a recent epidemic in China (Figure 6) . Most SLA-1 * 1502-restricted PRRSV peptides are located in the non-structural protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) encoded by ORF1a and 1b. Although numerous 9mer SLA-1 * 1502-binding peptides exist in each of these four PRRSV strains (\u223c90 peptides), only 30 peptides were found to be completely conserved in all four strains (Table S2) . RDRP contains 13 conserved peptides, which is a much greater number than in the other proteins.",

Additionally, swine IFN-\u03b3 expression in the peripheral blood of each pig was detected according to the methods used by Kumar and Walker (34, 35) . Secreted IFN-\u03b3 was detectable in all of the immunized pigs but was lower than the lowest detectable limit in all control pigs ( Figure 8C) .

The crystal structure of SLA-1 * 1502 exhibits the typical structural characteristics of an MHC I complex. The structure of SLA-1 * 1502 is very similar to those of SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202, indicating that the overall combination of heavy chains, light chains, and peptides in the swine SLA-I complex is highly conserved. However, in terms of peptide binding, the SLA-1 * 1502 structure not only reflects the common features of SLA-I alleles but also exhibits unique allelic-specific characteristics. Similar to the previously resolved SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202, the N-terminus of the SLA-1 * 1502 PBG is open because the amino acid at position 167 of the A pocket is a small Ser (Figure 2A) , but in other species such as humans and mice, the amino acid at this position is a large Trp (19, 20) . The peptide-binding motif of SLA-1 * 1502, like that of SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202, is determined by the three pockets B, D and F together, while the HLA-I molecule is mostly determined by the two pockets B and F. These common characteristics indicate that SLA-I has its own unique species features in binding peptides. In the B and F pocket composition, SLA-1 * 1502 and SLA-1 * 0401 are very similar, and only the non-critical amino acids in the individual positions are different (Figure 3) , resulting in a large overlap of the anchoring residues accommodated in their B and F pockets (20) . In the structures of SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202, the D pocket plays a key role in fixing the bound peptides, with a strong salt bridge between the charged residue 156 and the P3 residue of the peptides (19, 20) . The uncharged Met 156 of SLA-1 * 1502 cannot form strong charge interactions with P3 residues similar to those observed for SLA-1 * 0401 and SLA-3 * hs0202 (Figure 4) . Nevertheless, the D pocket is still important in determining the peptide binding of SLA-1 * 1502 and prefers uncharged residues of a certain size to form sufficient VDWs. The three p/SLA I structures indicate that regardless of its properties, the D pocket is critical in determining the peptide-binding motif of SLA-I, and this phenomenon is expected to be a common feature among different SLA-I alleles.",

Four typical PRRSV strains of the North American genotype were used to screen SLA-1 * 1502-restricted binding peptides. According to the summarized peptide-binding motifs, approximately 90 peptides in each PRRSV strain could be presented by SLA-1 * 1502. These peptides are unevenly distributed in different regions, with the NSP3/4/5 proteins encoded by ORF1a, NSP9/10/11 encoded by ORF1b and GP2/3 exhibiting most of the candidate peptide epitopes. Approximately one out of three peptides are conserved among the four PRRSV strains, and approximately half of these peptides are encoded by ORF1b of RDRP. CTL-epitope-based vaccines present advantages in terms of safety, specificity, and usability and are successfully used to control many viruses, such as HIV, HPV, and dengue virus (38) (39) (40) (41) . Although studies aimed at developing an anti-PRRSV epitope-based vaccine have been performed, no mature product is currently available (42) (43) (44) .

However, the absence of SLA-I tetramers limits effective and convincing research on swine antiviral CTL responses, especially regarding accurate quantitative research. In this study, the crystallized NSP9-TMP9 peptide was used to produce the tetramer for evaluating SLA-1 * 1502-restricted CTL responses. The NSP9-TMP9 epitope could induce CD8 and tetramer double-positive CTLs at a rate of \u223c0.5-1% in MLV+NSP-TMP9-immunized pigs, similar to the results obtained for other known efficiently protective viral CTL epitopes found in humans and mice by FACS (47) (48) (49) . Our results also showed that the MLV used (produced by the VR2332 strain) could induce a CTL response specific to PRRS. Somewhat disappointingly, we do not have live PRRSV with which to challenge these swine groups and evaluate the protection of MLV and NSP-TMP9 epitope. However, NSP9-TMP9 was identified as an immunogenic epitope that could stimulate the proliferation of specific CD8 + CTLs and the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in SPF Landrace pigs bearing SLA-1 * 1502 alleles. Immunization enhancement with NSP9-TMP9 produces a specific CTL response similar to that of immunization with MLV, indicating that the peptide vaccine can produce effective immunoprotection and thus that it is feasible to develop an effective PRRSV polypeptide epitope vaccine.",

Using the tetramer of SLA-1 * 1502, the immunogenicity of NSP9-TMP9 was identified by FACS and the expression of IFN-\u03b3. The results increase our understanding of how to acquire a viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS disease. In addition, this study provides a complete and credible method for identifying SLA-I-restricted viral epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility of peptide vaccines in antiviral immunity of swine. Based on our experimental results, we encourage and promote the development of a safe peptide vaccine that can effectively activate CTL immune protection, solve the safety problems FIGURE 8 | Identification of the functional NSP9-TMP9 CTL epitope. (A) Immunization program for SPF pigs. Nine pigs expressing SLA-1*1502 were divided into three groups: the MLV group, MLV+Peptide group and blank control group. The MLV and MLV+Peptide groups were injected with an attenuated PRRSV vaccine as the first immunization. Seven days later, the MLV+Peptide group was injected with the NSP9-TMP9 peptide mixed with CFA, and the MLV group was injected with MLV mixed with CFA as the second immunization. At day 14, the MLV+Peptide group was injected with the NSP9-TMP9 peptide mixed with IFA, and the MLV group was injected with MLV mixed with IFA as the third immunization. Pigs in control group were injected with PBS, deionized water mixed with CFA, and deionized water mixed with IFA. (B) NSP9-TMP9-specific CTLs stained with PE-labeled SLA-1*1502 tetramer and FITC-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody were detected via flow cytometry. (C) The secreted IFN-\u03b3 contents of the control group and immunized group were measured via ELISA kit. The secreted IFN-\u03b3 content of the control group was less than the lowest detectable limit (78 pg/mL). caused by conventional attenuated vaccines, and provide new ideas for controlling not only PRRS but also the extent of African swine fever.",
