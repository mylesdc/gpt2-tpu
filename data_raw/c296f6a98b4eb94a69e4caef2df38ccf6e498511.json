The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms responsible for vascular changes occurring in the lungs of calves infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and challenged later with bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), evaluating the role of M\u03a6s in the development of pathological lesions in this organ. For this purpose, pulmonary lesions were compared between co-infected calves and healthy animals inoculated only with BHV-1 through immunohistochemical (MAC387, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, iNOS, COX-2 and Factor-VIII) and ultrastructural studies. Both groups of calves presented important vascular alterations produced by fibrin microthrombi and platelet aggregations within the blood vessels. These findings were earlier and more severe in the co-infected group, indicating that the concomitance of BVDV and BHV-1 in the lungs disrupts the pulmonary homeostasis by facilitating the establishment of an inflammatory and procoagulant environment modulated by inflammatory mediators released by pulmonary M\u03a6s. In this regard, the co-infected calves, in spite of presenting a greater number of IM\u03a6s than single-infected group, show a significant decrease in iNOS expression coinciding with the presence of more coagulation lesions. Moreover, animals pre-inoculated with BVDV displayed an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1 and IL-1), which play a key role in activating the immune response, as well as in the local cell-mediated response.",

The etiologic agents related to feedlot pneumonias include bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine coronavirus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma spp. [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Thus, in the negative control calves, this Ab prompted positive granular immunostaining among sheathed capillary cells, free in the interstitium and occasionally in M\u03a6s cytoplasm. However, in the inoculated groups, clusters of immunostained granular material were observed in blood vessels. Moreover, numerous IM\u03a6s and periarterial M\u03a6s, together with some PAM, were swollen and displayed an intense positive granular and cytoplasmic reaction in both inoculated groups between 4 and 7 dpi (Figure 2A, 2B) . In the BVDV/BHV-1 group, clusters of platelets were observed from 1 dpi, being more evident throughout the study associated with M\u03a6s engulfing platelets that peaked at 4 dpi (score value of 3 in all evaluated fields) ( Figure 3 ). Subsequently, the positive reaction in M\u03a6s and vascular lumina diminished considerably without recovering thereafter ( Figure 2C ). There was a significant difference in the presence of platelet clusters in this group throughout the study (p = 0.0119). In the BHV-1 group, these findings were observed from 2 dpi with similar values to the co-infected group, decreasing the number of platelet clusters until the end of the study (Figures 2D  and 3) . However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of these clusters in the lungs of animals infected only with BHV-1.",

Thus, the BVH-1 group calves display an increase in IL-1 synthesis by septal M\u03a6s coinciding with the onset of platelet aggregation in the lungs (2 dpi). This, together with the subsequent action of TNF\u03b1, would favor the maintenance of the procoagulant setting. By contrast, BVDV/BHV-1 group calves, whilst exhibiting a higher number of IM\u03a6sthe main producers of these cytokinesdisplayed inhibited IL-1 expression until 7 dpi, along with a minimal TNF\u03b1 response. This impaired cytokine production, also observed at the systemic level [40] , indicates that the synergic action of both chemical mediators can be ruled out as a potential mechanism for inducing platelet aggregation in the co-infected group. Calves inoculated only with NCP BVDV (0 dpi for the BVDV/BHV-1 group) displayed greater expression of iNOS by septal M\u03a6s than healthy calves [34, 35, 54] . However, following BHV-1 inoculation, BVDV/BHV-1 group calves exhibited an early decline in iNOS (1 dpi), an inflammatory mediator that limits the extent and duration of pathogen-induced platelet activation [55] . This finding, together with the moderate response of TNF\u03b1, may have favored the appearance of platelet aggregates in the early stages of the disease, and intense aggregation coinciding with the greatest decrease in iNOS levels (4 dpi).",

However, in view of the damage observed at later stages, this action was presumably unable to counter the procoagulant events associated with the drop in iNOS expression, these being additionally enhanced by the delayed action of IL-1 in co-infected animals. Slowed blood flow, together with cytokine release, may lead to increased vascular permeability and extravasation of leukocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma [11, 53, 56, 57] .",

In this respect, further research is required into the possible involvement of this concomitance, through the use of live BVDV and BHV-1 vaccines, in the triggering of an impaired pulmonary immune response. On the contrary, animals pre-inoculated with BVDVdespite suffering a transient infection -exhibit an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines which play a key role in activating the immune response.
