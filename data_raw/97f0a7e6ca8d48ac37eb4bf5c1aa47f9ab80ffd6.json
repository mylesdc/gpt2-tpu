These assays require a testing time of at least 30 min to more than 1 h [17, 18] . Alere i RSV test results are available A limitation of our study is the use of VTM for Alere i RSV testing instead of directly inserting the swab to the Alere test base. Using VTM was required to establish the RT-PCR reference standard. This procedure is in accordance with the Alere i RSV package insert, but implies that samples are 1:5 diluted in comparison to directly inserting the swab. In our analysis, this could have provoked false negative results in samples with low viral load, and regular point-of-care users might prefer direct, non-diluted testing of swab specimens. Second, we compared Alere i RSV test results against a multiplex RT-PCR reference standard. Only divergent results were further evaluated by monoplex RT-PCR. Multiplex RT-PCR is usually slightly less sensitive than monoplex RT-PCR in samples with low viral load. [19] In pediatric patients, viral loads are usually high and in fact, 95% of our RSV positive samples had a C T value <30. We therefore believe that multiplex RT-PCR is a rigorous reference standard in our study cohort, but acknowledge that applying a monoplex RT-PCR reference standard might have resulted in a slightly lower sensitivity of the Alere i RSV assay.",
