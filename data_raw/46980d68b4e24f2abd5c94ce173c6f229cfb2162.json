Bound phage was then detected with 200 \u03bcL 1:1000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (GE Healthcare, 27-9421-01, USA) in blocking buffer. Finally, the peroxidase activity was rapidly detected with substrate solution TMB upon addition of a sulfuric acid stop solution. The absorbance of the reaction was determined at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (Shanghai Utrao Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).",

In this study, we used a phage-displayed heptapeptide library to identify G 1 protein interactors, and the conditions of the selection were strictly limited to enrichment specific G 1 -binding phages( Table 2) . After four rounds of panning, 11 deduced peptide amino acid sequences from 27 selected candidate phage clones exhibited high affinity to G 1 protein according to ELISA (Fig. 2) . And these peptide sequences showed partial consensus motifs (Table 3 ), indicating that the screening process was successful. Meanwhile, partial consensus motifs which is possibly typical functional motifs of more complex proteins would be promising to discover the ligands of G 1 glycoprotein and analyze their roles in the context of BEFV infection. In addition, there has no report about BEFV receptor, and the consensus motif may mimic the discontinuous binding site as receptor agonists/antagonists or regulate the biological function of receptors [37] [38] [39] .",

It is reported that the BEFV G 1 protein located at the C-terminal stalk of the G protein is one target of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and G 1 protein is a linear neutralization site (Y487-K503) that comprises two minimal B cell epitopes [5, 11] .The potential significant achievement of our work is the discovery of mimic antibodies, synthetic peptide in vitro could be used as a specific antibody mimic to detect BEFV in virusinfected cells.",

Interestingly, the phage clone T18 and T25 exhibited binding affinity to G 1 protein and antiviral activity against BEFV (Fig. 3) , whereas other phages with high affinity to G 1 protein did not effectively inhibit the replication of BEFV. This means that the binding affinity of other phages do not necessarily connection with antiviral activity. In addition, a possible explanation of antiviral activity is that the G 1 protein binding phage ligand mediates an inhibitory effect of BEFV infection by competitive binding to receptor binding sites or neutralizing epitopes and thus inhibits the virus attachment/entry. In order to exclude the effect of phage itself on protein binding and antiviral activity against BEFV, we synthesized T18 and T25 peptides in vitro and conducted the reduce plaque assay in vero cells that significantly formed cytopathic plaque during BEFV infection. The results showed that the synthetic peptides could significantly inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque (Fig. 4) and inhibit BEFV replication in a dose dependent way (Fig. 5) . Altogether, T18 and T25 peptides are potentially potent antiviral molecules worthy of further development and test. This study provides an inexpensive way to discover functional motif for BEFV infection using the phage-display technology, which is possible to find the potential protein to mediate the interaction between BEFV and the host.
