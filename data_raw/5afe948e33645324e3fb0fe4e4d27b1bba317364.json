Although these infections are usually relatively mild, some children develop respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation and admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aetiology of (severe) LRTI is often difficult to establish. However, the majority of LRTIs in this young age group is believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. For the detection of respiratory viruses two conventional methods are commonly used: viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays. In addition, a third method based on molecular techniques has now become available, namely (real-time) PCR. Specifically, the real-time PCR format provides rapid results, within a clinically relevant period of time. It allows quantitative virus detection, and no post-PCR processing needs to be performed. Moreover, compared with standard format PCR, the risk for contamination is strongly reduced with real-time PCR, rendering false-positive results with real-time PCR highly unlikely [3] .",

Viral culture has been considered the gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses, but its limitation is that it can only detect a small number. Furthermore, the yield of viral culture depends on the quality of sampling, the correct transport and storage of samples, and the type of cells used. In addition, the technique has a turnaround time of several days to weeks, and is therefore unable to guide initial patient management. The results of DIF assays are available more rapidly, and this has been shown to improve patient outcome with less antibiotic use and shorter hospital stay [5] [6] [7] . Unfortunately, the DIF assay is less sensitive than culture for the detection of certain pathogens.",

Rapid and sensitive testing for a broad range of respiratory viruses is vital in the PICU, and it can improve our understanding of severe viral respiratory infections.

When conducting a Medline search (1966 to September 2005) with the search terms LRTI, PCR, and RSV or respiratory viruses, we identified 11 hospital-based paediatric studies that compared PCR with conventional techniques for more than two respiratory viruses [8] [9] [10] [11] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . PCR was found to have excellent sensitivity in all studies, if conventional methods were considered the reference standard (0.91-1.00). In summary, these studies showed that PCR increased the diagnostic yield by by up to 25% as compared with conventional techniques. However, most studies selected patients on the basis of respiratory test results, rather than selecting patients by admission diagnosis. Exceptions include the studies conducted by Weinberg and coworkers [22] and Jennings and colleagues [9] . Weinberg and coworkers [22] tested samples from 668 hospitalized children and selected patients on admission diagnoses by the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. PCR assays were used to test for RSV, influenzaviruses and PIV 1-3. With viral culture 89 (13%) specimens were positive, as compared with 185 (28%) positive specimens with PCR. Jennings and colleagues [9] enrolled 75 hospitalized children using a case definition of acute respiratory infection, and performed viral diagnostics for a broad range of viruses. PCR identified 39 additional viruses, adding up to a total of 87 viruses found in 65 (87%) children [9] .",

In previous studies the detection of multiple infections varied considerably, ranging from 0.6% to 27%. A low prevalence was found in studies using PCR for RSV, influenzaviruses and PIVs only [18, 22] . In contrast, a high prevalence was found in studies that included a broad range of respiratory viruses (including rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and hMPV) [9] . Interestingly, in the latter study most coronaviruses were identified as part of multiple virus infections (three out of four), which is in accordance with our findings.",

The fact that almost half of the children were diagnosed with a possible bacterial infection indicates the difficulty of precluding this diagnosis. In addition, previous studies showed that viral infection may pave the way for bacterial infection [32] . The only study that compared viral diagnostic methods in a similar population of PICU patients did not report on the prevalence of bacterial infections, and so we can not compare this finding with those from other studies [16] . In contrast to the high prevalence of possible or proven bacterial infection found in our study group, we did not demonstrate infections with atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. It can be speculated that atypical pathogens do not play an important role in children with severe LRTI.",

The rapidity and sensitivity of real-time PCR test results can help the clinician to initiate appropriate cohorting strategies to prevent other critically ill children from nosocomial viral infections. A reliable and rapid viral test result can also be taken into account when prescribing or discontinuing antibiotic treatment. Our study was not designed to determine when antibiotic treatment for LRTI in the PICU is warranted. The high percentage of possible or proven bacterial infections in our viral LRTI patients indicates that antibiotic treatment poses a dilemma in the PICU. The clinical impact of the high prevalence of multiple virus infections detected in our PICU remains unclear because they were not associated with different clinical characteristics. Further research with larger numbers of patients and age-matched control groups is needed to determine the real clinical impact of multiple infections and to determine whether the use of real-time PCR prevents unnecessary antibiotic treatment. However, real-time PCR offers a rapid, sensitive and highly reliable new technique that may improve our understanding of the epidemiology of severe LRTIs.",
