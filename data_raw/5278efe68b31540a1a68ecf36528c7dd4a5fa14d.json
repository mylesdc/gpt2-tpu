Here, we describe a three-tiered hybrid mass spectrometry approach that enables the dissection of macromolecular complexes in order to complement structural studies. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we investigate ribosomes, large ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of a multitude of protein and RNA subunits. We identify sites of sequence processing, protein post-translational modifications, and the assembly and stoichiometry of individual ribosomal proteins in four distinct ribosomal particles of bacterial, plant and human origin. Amongst others, we report extensive cysteine methylation in the zinc finger domain of the human S27 protein, the heptameric stoichiometry of the chloroplastic stalk complex, the heterogeneous composition of human 40S ribosomal subunits and their association to the CrPV, and HCV internal ribosome entry site RNAs.",

With its ability to analyze biological systems at multiple levels-whether its metabolites, RNA and DNA, proteins, protein complexes or entire proteomes-the MS toolbox has proven invaluable in a life science research environment [2] [3] [4] . While methods like (phospho)-proteomics and metabolomics have firmly settled in the field of cell biology, the use of MS methods for characterizing protein complexes in a structural biology setting is less matured. With recent developments in data analysis for cross-linking MS, this technique is rapidly gaining popularity among structural and systems biologists for its ability to map protein-protein interactions on a global scale [5] [6] [7] . However, other MS approaches can also complement structural biology techniques and provide highly useful insight into the assembly and composition of macromolecular assemblies 8 . Here, we describe a three-tiered MS approach for the detailed characterization of protein complexes and highlight its use by characterizing various ribosomal particles from different organisms and organelles.",

Their composition and architecture vary along the phylogenetic tree, from eukaryotes to bacteria as well as among the organellar ribosomes, although their functional elements catalyzing the key reactions like the decoding of the mRNA and the formation of the peptide bond are highly conserved 9, 10 . Recent developments in structural biology techniques, notably X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), have provided insight into the structure and function of many ribosomal complexes and in combination with biophysical and biochemical data led to a detailed understanding of the translation mechanism 11 . Yet, even with structures of ribosomes from many kingdoms of life and different organelles resolved [12] [13] [14] [15] , small but potentially important features of ribosomal particles have been mostly overlooked. These features, including specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs), sequence variations, binding of protein cofactors or sub-stoichiometric presence of ribosomal proteins, can be elusive to standard structural biology techniques and therefore require the use of complementary approaches, such as mass spectrometry (MS).",

            "text": "Our three-tiered MS approach makes use of a set of MS techniques, which provide information on the composition, assembly, and activity of ribosomal particles (Fig. 1) . First, bottom-up liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a MS technique commonly used in proteomics research, provides the ability to identify and quantify the ribosomal proteins and their PTMs 16 . Moreover, it can determine the presence of ribosomeinteracting factors, which have remained bound to the ribosomal particles during their purification 17 . Common bottom-up LC-MS/ MS workflows start with unfolding of the proteins followed by their digestion into peptides. These peptide mixtures are separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sequenced by a mass spectrometer. For the second tier, top-down LC-MS/MS, proteins are denatured but kept intact and separated by a HPLC system. The intact masses of the different proteins and their cooccurring proteoforms are measured by the mass spectrometer, providing an overview of all the different versions of the gene products such as proteins carrying multiple PTMs. Proteins are identified in top-down LC-MS/MS through top-down sequencing, which can additionally localize PTMs [18] [19] [20] . In this way, top-down LC-MS/ MS can potentially provide information on proteoforms of ribosomal proteins that would have been lost upon digestion into peptides like the crosstalk between different PTMs 20 . The third tier in the approach, native MS, omits even the unfolding step and introduces the intact ribonucleoprotein complexes into the mass spectrometer, after which their masses are measured 21, 22 . Because non-covalent interactions are generally preserved in native MS, accurate mass measurements of the complexes can provide detailed insight into their composition, including the stoichiometry of the protein or nucleic acid subunits [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, using the latest innovations in mass-analyzers, native MS can resolve and characterize co-occurring assemblies, such as ribosomes with and without an interacting protein or with substoichiometric presence of a ribosomal protein, as was recently demonstrated for prokaryotic ribosomal particles 26 .",

Standard top-down LC-MS/MS experiments encounter a number of challenges that limit the analytical depth of the analyses. When full MS spectra are acquired to determine which proteoforms are selected for subsequent top-down sequencing events, there is an information redundancy that comes from the repeated selection and fragmentation of the different charge states of the same proteoform. Additionally, current workflows regularly employ full MS scans at Three-tiered mass spectrometry based approach for the dissection and characterization of ribosomal particles. The three-tiered hybrid mass spectrometry approach described here can provide insight into multiple molecular levels, ranging from the amino acid sequence of individual ribosomal proteins to the stoichiometric composition of the intact ribonucleoprotein particles. Which tier in the approach provides information on which level is indicated in green. The structural model of the E. coli 70S ribosome (PDB 4YBB) displays the rRNA in gray, the proteins of the 30S subunit in red and of the 50S subunit in blue 70 high resolving power (R = 120,000 at m/z = 200) to determine the proteoform charge state from the isotopic distributions, followed by top-down sequencing also performed at high resolving power (socalled \"High-High\" workflows). However, on Orbitrap\u2122 mass spectrometers, the short-lived transients of large proteins (>30 kDa) are generally suppressed when competing with the longer lived transients of smaller proteins, introducing a negative bias in the identification of larger proteins. Additionally, to isotopically resolve the high molecular weight proteins (>60 kDa), longer transient times are required (>500 ms) that are generally less compatible with the LC timescales of top-down LC-MS/MS analysis. By acquiring the full MS spectra at medium resolution (R = 7500 at m/z = 200), but the MS/MS data at high resolving power (termed \"Medium-High\" workflows), the bias is removed and both large and small proteins can be identified by top-down sequencing. At this resolution, the isotopic distributions of the proteoforms remain unresolved. This information is used to calculate their charge states, an essential part of the experiment since this information is required for the determination of fragmentation parameters (e.g., collision voltage), database searching (calculation of the measured mass) and the sequencing of co-eluting proteins (exclusion of different charge states of the same proteoform). We solved these redundancy and bias issues by actively (on-the-fly) deconvoluting the mediumresolution full MS spectra, assigning charge and mass to every peak in the spectrum (Methods section).",

While the medium-resolution scans contain clearly resolved charge states, the high-resolution scans suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio hampering identification. Moreover, the Medium-High method allows for shorter duty cycles (Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and faster processing time of the deconvolution algorithm ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). On the other hand, the highresolution full MS of High-High workflows provides a higher number of reliably deconvoluted proteoforms for lower molecular weight proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ) making the two approaches somewhat complementary ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

In this way, we could identify all expected 57 ribosomal proteins of the So70S ribosome, 47 ribosomal proteins of the Hs60S and 33 ribosomal proteins of the Hs40S ribosomal subunit.

The main impurities seem to be non-ribosomal, generally high abundant chloroplastic proteins ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). Additionally, a small set of low abundant proteins of the cytosolic 80S ribosome are detected. The majority of the proteins in the Hs40S sample belong to the 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by a number of mitoribosomal proteins of the 39S large subunit (Fig. 2b ). The Hs60S sample seems to be most pure since there is a much larger gap between the abundance of the 60S ribosomal proteins and other copurified proteins (Fig. 2c) . Additionally, the main impurities here include ribosomal proteins of the 40S subunit and not mitoribosomal proteins. The top-down LC-MS/MS runs show highly comparable results when inspecting the identified proteins. In the human 40S sample, around half of the ribosomal proteins identified were mitochondrial.

Characterization of these proteins is not limited to identification; the snRNP SM D1 was found to be dimethylated nine times in its glycine-and arginine-rich C-terminus and the fragmentation maps of the snRNP E protein suggest that its initiator methionine is removed and the protein is both acetylated and dimethylated ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

Bottom-up LC-MS/MS provides great depth to characterize lower abundant proteins and has no upper limit in protein Fig. 6 ).

Protein L27 is encoded in the nucleus and identification of the protein only occurred when the first 58 amino acids (determined previously to be the transit peptide) were removed (Fig. 3b, c) . However, removal of these amino acids still left a~1.2 kDa mass difference between the measured mass and the sequence mass and no C-terminal fragments could be detected. By removing amino acids 182-194 this mass difference could be accounted for and 10 fragment ions from the C-terminus were newly identified. Interestingly, the online transit peptide prediction tool ChloroP also predicts the presence of a cleavage site between amino acids 181 and 182, suggesting similar processing enzymes may have performed the cleavage 35 . Protein S6 is encoded in the nucleus and is reported to exist in multiple forms resulting from distinct transit peptide cleavages (Fig. 3d , e). In line with this, the protein was identified with up to 9 kDa mass differences, only C-terminal fragment ions and in five different forms with ranging abundance. Uniprot reports five different N-termini at positions 66, 71, 77, 86, and 91 while ChloroP predicts transit peptide cleavage sites between amino acids 61 and 62. By combining the intact masses of the S6 proteoforms with their corresponding fragmentation maps we could determine the N-terminal processing in this ribosomal protein. The most abundant form of S6 has Ala-61 as N-terminal amino acid, as predicted by ChloroP, and has additional Nterminal acetylation. Three additional S6 variants could be detected, which all have a single amino acid less at the Nterminus, suggesting they are likely a result of exo-proteolytic processing rather than differential transit peptide cleavages. A fifth form starts with Ser-68 and is N-terminally acetylated while the last, second most abundant form, which features Pro-83 at the N-terminus, lacks acetylation. The data on chloroplastic ribosomal protein S6 nicely illustrate the richness of the ribosomal proteome through co-occurring proteoforms and the benefit of top-down characterization.",

            "text": "Novel cysteine methylations in human ribosomal proteins. The advantage of top-down LC-MS/MS over bottom-up LC-MS/MS is not just limited to the detection of unknown sequence processing events. Ribosomal proteins can also exist in multiple proteoforms as the result of PTMs. These modifications can be detected in bottom-up MS but by digesting the protein information on any potential crosstalk between modified sites is lost. In top-down LC-MS/MS, all proteoforms with distinct masses can be detected based on their intact mass. Information on the site and occupancy of the modifications can be gathered from the fragmentation spectra. A good example of this is the human ribosomal protein S27 that we found to be multiply methylated (Fig. 4) . Initially, S27 was identified with a mass around 42 Da higher than the mass predicted from the sequence, hinting at acetylation. However, fragmentation maps indicated removal of the initiator methionine leaving an N-terminal proline, making N-terminal acetylation unlikely 36 . Close inspection of the proteoforms identified as S27 revealed an additional variant with a mass difference around 28 Da, albeit lower abundant. Since this suggested methylation rather than acetylation we performed an in-depth analysis of the top-down fragmentation spectra. By comparing the masses of fragments from both the N-and the C-terminus with their theoretical masses based on the S27 sequence, we found fragments of the protein carrying between one and three modifications with a mass of 14 Da. We assigned these modifications as methylations to three cysteines at positions 39, 55, and 58 (Fig. 4b) . Interestingly, these cysteines are all part of a C4-type zinc finger domain that protrudes from the side of the 40S subunit (Fig. 4c) . Methylation likely prevents the binding of a zinc ion, which agrees well with the electron density map 37 . Although methylation of cysteine residues in S27 has been reported in yeast ribosomes, methylation was never reported for human ribosomes, nor to this extent 38 . This is likely caused by the fact that in standard bottom-up LC-MS/MS workflows cysteine methylation is not commonly included in the database search. The role of this modification is unknown although methylation of cysteines in TGF-beta-activated kinases prevented zinc binding and recognition of ubiquitin chains 39 . We could not detect any cysteine methylation in the other C4-type zinc finger proteins present in human cytosolic ribosomes (L37, L37A, S27A, and S29) making it unlikely the observed modifications are artifacts of sample handling.",

            "text": "Up to now, we focused on the benefits of bottom-up and topdown LC-MS/MS in the characterization of the composition of ribosomal particles. However, with these methods it is hard to gather any information on the stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins in the particles, an area where native MS can play an important role. The ribosomal L7/L12 stalk is a sub-complex within the large ribosomal subunit involved in the binding of several translation factors 40 . It is composed of a single copy of the L10 protein bound by multiple dimers of the L7/L12 protein, where L7 is the N-terminally acetylated form of L12. The stoichiometry of the proteins in the ribosomal stalk depends on the number of binding sites for L7/L12 dimers on the flexible tail of L10 and can be predicted based on sequence alignment (Fig. 5a ) 41 . Additionally, the stoichiometry can be determined unambiguously using a specific native MS experiment, as has been shown previously for ribosomal stalks of Thermotoga maritima and Thermus thermophilus (heptameric, L10 [L7/L12] 6 ) and Bacillus subtilis and E. coli (pentameric, L10 [L7/L12] 4 ) 42, 43 . Due to the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts, the chloroplastic 70S ribosomes have a prokaryotic evolutionary ancestor and we set out to determine the oligomeric state of the chloroplastic stalks. Therefore, we made use of the in-source trapping activation of the recently described QE-UHMR mass spectrometer to release stalk complexes from the chloroplastic 70S ribosomes and measured their mass as being 103.4 kDa (Fig. 5b) , revealing a heptameric stoichiometry 26, 44 . Isolation of ions of the intact stalk complex in the quadrupole and subsequent HCD fragmentation ejected a single L12 subunit that further confirmed this assignment (Fig. 5b) . We also used top-down LC-MS/MS to identify potential PTMs or processing of the stalk proteins in the Ec70S, So70S and Hs60S ribosomal particles. This revealed that unlike stalks in E. coli, chloroplastic ribosomes contain nearly no L7-form of the L12 protein and additionally no protein methylation could be detected (Fig. 5c) . In human 60S subunits, stalks consist of the equivalent proteins P0 and dimers of P1 and P2. Our data reveal that these proteins are present as different phospho-isoforms harboring either 0, 1, or 2 phosphorylations in about equal abundance in our preparations (Fig. 5d) . Fig. 3 Top-down analysis using high precursor mass window searches identifies processing of the plastid ribosomal proteins. a For the plastid-specific ribosomal proteins (PSRPs) of the chloroplastic 70S ribosome, the translation factor pY and the ribosome recycling factor (RRF), several co-occurring proteoforms could be identified and quantified, resulting from post-translational modification and/or processing of the termini. In the corresponding cryo-EM structure of the chloroplastic 70S ribosome, RRF was not modelled due to absence of electron density 14 . b, c The chloroplastic ribosomal protein L27 is processed at both the N-and C-terminus and is therefore not detected through top-down sequencing when searching for the intact gene product. Corrections to either the N-or C-terminal sequence provides fragment ions from the C-and N-terminus, respectively, as long as the precursor mass window is larger than the mass of the sequence correction. d, e In a similar way, variable processing at the N-terminus of the chloroplastic ribosomal protein S6 could be detected by using C-terminal fragments to first identify which intact masses belong to S6 and subsequently correct the sequence until the theoretical and measured masses matched",

Addition of the mass of the L41 protein (3456.35 Da) to the theoretical mass of the 40S particle already lowered the mass deviation to~1.7 kDa. The remaining deviation can be partly explained by the attachment of metal ions or other small molecules to the ribosomes and incomplete desolvation of the ions inside the mass spectrometer. By making use of the high resolving power of the QE-UHMR mass spectrometer, we could confidently identify other, lower abundant 40S ribosomal particles (Fig. 6a, red lacking either a copy of the ribosomal protein S10 (18.9 kDa) or S25 (13.6 kDa), respectively (Supplementary Figure 10g) . Interestingly, both of these proteins were also identified as substoichiometric components of human ribosomal particles in a recent selective reaction monitoring study by Shi et al. 45 . S25 was found to be mainly absent in polysomes and translation of mRNA transcripts involved in vitamin B12 pathways was influenced by the presence of this ribosomal protein. Regardless, compared to other small ribosomal subunits like Ec30S and So30S, the heterogeneity of the human 40S subunit remains rather low (Supplementary Fig. 10 ) 26 . Motivated by our ability to collect high-resolution native mass spectra of intact human 40S ribosomal subunits and to detect the presence or absence of individual proteins we wanted to see if we could also detect binding of functional RNA molecules to the ribosome. Therefore, we reconstituted complexes of human 40S subunits with internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA elements from cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). IRES elements are specific RNA sequences that by binding to ribosomal particles in a specific way allow for translation start while skipping certain steps of the canonical initiation process. The elements are frequently present within viral RNAs to stimulate expression of viral proteins over host cell proteins 37,46,47 . We collected native mass spectra of mixtures of free and IRES bound 40S ribosomal particles and monitored the increase in mass upon binding of the RNA, which we determined as 66 kDa for CrPV IRES and 106 kDa for HCV IRES (Fig. 6b) . Since the sequences of the IRES RNA fragments were not exactly known, we also collected high-resolution native mass spectra of the free IRES RNA structures to determine their mass. These masses (CrPV: 64,054.27 Da, HCV: 103,726.19 Da) were in good agreement with the increase in mass of the 40S subunits upon IRES binding, indicating that the ribosomal particles do not undergo a significant change in composition upon binding of the viral RNA elements. Furthermore, these data unambiguously demonstrate the 1:1 stoichiometry of IRES binding to the 40S human ribosome.",

By making use of the latest technological advances in the field of MS, most notably in top-down LC-MS/MS and native MS, our approach probes several aspects of ribosomal particles generally considered elusive to traditional structural biology methods. Above we highlighted several examples where we used the approach to gain novel insight into protein PTMs, co-occurring proteoforms and processing of ribosomal proteins, protein and RNA stoichiometry and assembly of ribosomal particles. As such, the data described serve as a proof of principle that novel, interesting aspects of large ribonucleoprotein assemblies, as shown here for diverse ribosomal particles, can be discovered using hybrid MS approaches. It lays a foundation for future studies aiming to completely characterize macromolecular complexes. For instance, the cysteine methylations of human S27 could be followed through the different stages of translation or in different organisms. Furthermore, possibly in combination with cryo-EM, more effort should be invested into fully characterizing all the proteoforms of ribosomal proteins, the exact location of these modifications, and their impact on ribosome assembly and function, as has been recently attempted for ribosomal rRNA modifications 51, 56 .",

Instruments such as the Q Exactive HF-X and the Q Exactive UHMR used here improve the depth and detail of the information that can be extracted from ribosomal particle analysis. In the future, the approach described here can be supplemented with other parts of the mass spectrometry toolbox. Mainly top-down LC-MS/MS can benefit from the use of alternative fragmentation techniques such as Electron Transfer Dissociation or Ultraviolet Photodissociation 20,57,58 . These techniques have the potential to prevent proteins with labile modifications such as glycosylation or phophorylation to escape identification and PTM localization and further improve the sequence coverage of other proteins. The presence of PTMs can greatly increase the complexity of the protein mixtures introduced in the mass spectrometer and advanced LC separations (for instance ion-exchange columns 59 ) can help tackle these challenges. Additionally, advancements in data analysis software may improve the interpretation of both the raw mass spectra and large amount of information coming from all three tiers in the approach. This will make hybrid mass spectrometry approaches the ideal partner for the field of structural biology to completely unravel all details of ribosomal particles and other molecular machines 1, 60 . It is evident that structure function relationships of life's cellular machineries can only be fully elucidated by the use of multiple or hybrid technologies, whereby mass spectrometry may become an indispensable pillar.",

For Hs60S and So70S there were 4 and 2 false-positive PrSMs detected against reshuffled databases, respectively. Further analysis showed the false discovery rate to be below 0.25% ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ).",

The presence of three L7/L12 dimer binding sites predicts chloroplast ribosomal stalks to have a heptameric stoichiometry (L10 [L7/L12]6 ). b Determination of the chloroplastic ribosome stalk stoichiometry using a pseudo-MS3 experiment. Chloroplastic 70S ribosomes are introduced into the gas phase and activated in the source region to release intact stalk complexes (top) with a mass that corresponds well with the predicted heptameric stalks. Isolation and further fragmentation of these complexes releases a single copy of the L12 protein confirming the assignment of the oligomeric state. c A magnificiation of a representative charge state observed in top-down LC-MS/MS analysis of bacterial (E. coli) and chloroplastic (S. oleracea) ribosomal stalk proteins shows that unlike its bacterial counterpart, chloroplastic ribosomes contain almost no L7 protein and methylation of L7 or L12 is absent. d Human stalk complexes in the 60S ribosome consist of the phosphoproteins P0, P1, and P2. A magnificiation of a representative charge state observed in top-down LC-MS/MS analysis reveals that all three proteins are present in their unphosphorylated (0P), singly phosphorylated (1P), and double phosphorylated forms (2P) Human S27 harbors several methylated cysteines in its Zn-finger domain. a Intact mass spectra of S27 reveals three proteoforms with distinct masses (left). Based on the mass differences from the sequence mass of S27 these are identified as di-and tri-methylated forms of the protein (S27-Me 2 and S27-Me 3 ) and a third proteoform carrying an unknown modification (S27-UNK). An additional lower abundant disulfidelinked form was detected in fragmentation maps of the trimethylated form (S27-Me 3 -SS). b Top-down analysis of the S27-Me 3 fragmentation spectra pinpoints the methylation to the cysteine residues 40, 56, and 59. Fragments are mapped along the protein sequence (vertical bars) and methylated amino acids are identified by a mass shift of 14 Da. c Structure of the human 40S subunit with protein S27 in green and its cysteine containing zinc finger domain in magenta (PDB 5A2Q). The zinc-finger cysteines are shown as sticks and the methylated cysteine residues DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04853-x | www.nature.com/naturecommunications",

The well-resolved charge states of three distinct forms of the ribosomal subunit could be detected. The most abundant fully assembled 1.2 MDa 40S particles are labeled in blue, while lower abundant particles lacking either the protein S25 or S10 are labeled in magenta and red, respectively. b Monitoring of the formation of a complex containing human 40S ribosomes and Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) RNA fragments of Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV) and Hepatits C virus (HCV). Mass spectra of the RNA fragments alone (insets) provide the accurate mass of the IRES elements. This mass corresponds well with the observed increase in mass of the 40S ribosome upon binding of the RNA indicating that the particles do not undergo a significant change in composition. Structures of the free 40S ribosomes (PDB 5A2Q) and particles bound by CrPV (PDB 4V91) and HCV IRES (PDB 5A2Q) are shown, with the ribosomal proteins in blue, the rRNA in gray and the IRES elements in yellow and green, respectively37,47",
