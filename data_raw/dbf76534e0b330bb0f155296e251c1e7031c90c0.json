A lack of clinically germane research has led to equivocal, and occasionally conflicting, healthcare respiratory protection recommendations from public health organizations, professional societies, and experts. Methods: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple U.S. study sites. Healthcare personnel who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators or medical masks for protection against infections during respiratory virus season. Outcome measures will include laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections, acute respiratory illness, and influenza-like illness. Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored by the study team.",

Airborne transmission plays a role with some human respiratory pathogens via small aerosol particles, often called droplet nuclei [3] . Airborne transmission is the predominant mode of transmission for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3, 14] and recent evidence has suggested a larger role than previously thought for Influenza A and B viruses [15, 16] .",

N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly known as \"N95 respirators\") are one type of RPD capable, with proper facial fit and usage, of reducing inhalation of airborne particulates by a factor of 10 or greater [17] . Medical masks (MM), typically called surgical masks in operative settings, are primarily devised to protect patients against infection spread by the wearer [18] . Both types of devices also serve as a physical barrier keeping sprays and splashes of infectious materials and contaminated hands and objects away from oronasal region of wearer. Although RPD and MM are capable of filtering particulates [19] , RPD are designed to filter smaller particulates that may remain airborne for long periods. A tight seal between the respirator and the wearer's face is designed to prevent leakage of particulates, a feature not provided by loose-fitting MM. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to ensure each HCP, who may be exposed to airbornetransmissible infections in the workplace, receives an RPD with an adequate respirator-to-face seal that is determined during a mandated annual \"fit-test\".",

Intuitively, RPD should better protect HCP against airborne infections than MM, but objective evidence has not validated this supposition. One possibility that may explain this discrepancy between expectations and observations is pragmatic: HCP, in general, do not tolerate N95 respirators as well as medical masks [29, 30] , perhaps prompting them to remove respirators more frequently and/or for longer periods, increasing the likelihood of exposure to infections. Models have shown that 25 % or more non-wear time during exposure negates any significant differences in protective ability between types of RPDs [17, 31] . Given the difficulty with HCP adherence to guidelines [4] and general dissatisfaction [4, [32] [33] [34] with RPD, medical masks worn more consistently may provide similar levels of reduction in respiratory viral disease transmission as N95 respirators.",

In addition to passage around the mask, some of the small particle aerosols are able to pass through the mask's filter media. Therefore, in addition to RPDs, filtration testing was done on medical masks prior to enrollment of subjects to ensure consistency between models across study locations. The filtration performance of the N95 respirators and medical mask models in the study were tested in a manner similar to that used by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Devices were attached to a test fixture and placed in a TSI 8130 automated filter tester operated with an air flow rate of 85 liters per minute. The TSI 8130 uses a photometer to measure the flux of light scattering from aerosol particles. Polydispersed particles (mass median diameter of~0.3 microns) were generated from a 2 % NaCl solution and passed through each device being tested for 1 min. Each test was repeated 3 times with a fresh N95 respirator or medical mask. To be certified as an N95 respirator, filter penetration needs to be less than 5 % (or 95 % efficient). As shown in Table 1 , the average penetration percentages for the NIOSH certified N95 respirators were an order of magnitude lower than those of medical masks, which are not NIOSH certified. Filter results between N95 respirator models and between medical mask models were comparable.",
