Dual luciferase reporter assays with TGF-\u03b21 promoter plasmids indicated that TGF-\u03b21 promoter region between \u2212175 to \u221260, the Egr-1 binding site, was responsible for TGF-\u03b21 promoter activation induced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Subcellular localization analysis of transcription factors showed PLpro triggering nuclear translocation of Egr-1, but not NF-\u03baB and Sp-1. Meanwhile, Egr-1 silencing by siRNA significantly reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21, TSP-1 and pro-fibrotic genes. Furthermore, the inhibitors for ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and STAT3 (Stattic) revealed ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway involving in Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter induced by PLpro. In a mouse model with a direct pulmonary injection, PLpro stimulated macrophage infiltration into lung, up-regulating Egr-1, TSP-1, TGF-\u03b21 and vimentin expression in lung tissues. The results revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro significantly triggered Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway, correlating with up-regulation of pro-fibrotic responses in vitro and in vivo.",

Two specific embedded proteases, papain-like (PLpro) and 3C-like (3CLpro), mediate the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab precursors into 16 nsps (termed nsp1-16). SARS-CoV PLpro is identified as a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains 9 . PLpro blocks polyI:C-induced activation of IRF3, NF-\u03ba B, and STAT1, correlating with the inhibitory effect on interferon (IFN) induction and signaling 10 . Recent, SARS-CoV PLpro exhibits the deubiquitinating enzymatic activity on RIG-I, STING, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3, in which suppresses STING-TRAF3-TBK1 signaling pathway, then negatively regulating IRF3 activation 11 .

Several transcription factors such as AP-1, Sp1, NF-\u03ba B, Egr-1, and STAT-3 transactivate TGF-\u03b2 1 promoter, in which are regulated by various cellular kinases 18 . Latent TGF-\u03b2 1 in the extracellular matrix is proteolytically cleaved by pro-protein convertases (furin, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9), then becomes as bioactive TGF-\u03b2 1 [19] [20] [21] .

Each group of 5 eight-weeks-old BALB/c male mice was injected 15 times, and then sacrificed. The lung tissues of each mouse in indicated groups were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and SYBR Green real time RT-PCR, respectively. For IHC staining, mouse lung tissues were fixed in formaldehyde and dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 30 min, in 95% ethanol for 30 min, and finally in 100% ethanol for 30 min. The tissues were embedded in paraffin at 58 \u00b0C, then cut at 4-15 \u03bc m thick section using a rotary microtome.

Our prior study demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro triggering the TGF\u03b2 1 production in human promonocytes 13 , whether SARS PLpro induced TGF-\u03b2 1 production in human lung epithelial A549 cells was further examined. Transient transfection of A549 cells with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro was performed to analyze the TGF-\u03b2 1 production induced by SARS PLpro. Quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting indicated transfection with pSARS-PLpro increasing the mRNA and protein levels of PLpro in A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but not empty control vector ( Fig. 1A-D) . Meanwhile, relative mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b2 1 in A549 cells were time-and concentration-dependently elevated following the transient transfection with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control ( Fig. 2A) . Immunofluorescence staining assays indicated the protein levels of TGF-\u03b2 1 obviously heightening in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 2B ). For examining the TGF-\u03b2 1 induction of SARS-CoV PLpro in different cell lines, Huh7 (human hepatocarcinoma), H1299 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma), and ca9-22 (human oral cancer) cells were also evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Real-time RT PCR analysis of transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro indicated that a lower level of TGF-\u03b2 1 mRNA was detected in transfected H1299 cells compared to transfected A549 cells, but no significant level was found in transfected Huh7 and ca9-22 cells. In addition, comparison of the expression levels of PLpro and TGF-\u03b2 1 among transfected cells with empty vector, pSARS-PLpro, and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394 ES (a non-infectious SARS-CoV replicon) was further performed (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). The expression level of PLpro in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro was 25-fold higher than the cells transfected with pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394 ES. A dose-dependent increase of TGF-\u03b2 1 mRNA levels in A549 cells was induced by pSARS-PLpro and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394 ES, respectively. Meanwhile, recombinant plasmids containing PLpro genes of MERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 (pMERS-PLpro, and pNL63-PLpro) were used for testing the specificity on the TGF-\u03b2 1 induction compared to pSARS-PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 3) . Interestingly, only SARS-CoV PLpro, but not ERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 PLpro, dose-dependently up-regulated the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b2 1. Therefore, the result demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro plays an important role in triggering a significant increase of TGF-\u03b2 1 mRNA and protein levels in human lung epithelial cells.",

Since the intracellular ROS generation was reported to modulate the expression of Egr-1 and TSP-1 26, 27 , the involvement of ROS-mediated pathway in PLpro-induced Egr-1-depedent activation of TGF-\u03b2 1 and pro-fibrotic responses was explored (Figs 8-10) . Intracellular ROS levels in PLpro-expressing and vector control cells were detected using flow cytometry with DCFH-DA staining (Fig. 8A) . DCF fluorescence analysis indicated PLpro triggered the ROS generation in a dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, ROS inhibitor (YCG063) concentration-dependently reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of Egr-1 and TSP-1 (Fig. 8B) . For insight into the pathway of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation, the activity of MAP kinases and transcription factors were analyzed using Western blotting (Fig. 9A,B) . ROS inhibitor (YCG063) significantly reduced PLpro-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT3. Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) notably declined the PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b2 1 and vimentin, as well as PLpro-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figs 9C and 10A,B) . STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic) also diminished PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, vimentin, and Type I collagen (Fig. 10C) . Therefore, results showed 1 or pSARS-PLpro were re-transfected with negative control or Egr-1siRNA were harvested 1 day post transfection for quantitative PCR (A) and Western blotting (B) assays. Relative mRNA levels of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b2 1, and vimentin were normalized by GAPDH mRNA, presenting as relative ratio. The Western blot was probed with indicated primary antibodies as an internal control, detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent HRP substrate. Relative band intensity of indicated proteins was normalized by \u03b2 actin, compared to the mock cell group, and quantified using imageJ based on triplicate replicates of each experiment (C). *p value < 0.05; **p value < 0.01 compared with vector control cells. For analysis of ROS-mediated signaling, A549 cells transfected with 10 \u03bc g of pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro were treated with or without ROS inhibitor (YCG063), and then harvested for Western blotting assays with specific primary antibodies against Egr-1, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-STAT3 (A). Relative band intensity of indicated proteins was normalized by \u03b2 actin, compared to the mock cell group, and quantified using imageJ based on triplicate replicates of each experiment (B). For conforming the role of p38 MAPK in ROS-dependent Egr-1 up-regulation, both types of cells were treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and then harvested for quantitating relative changes of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b2 1, and vimentin mRNA, in which was normalized by GAPDH mRNA and presented as the relative ratio (C). *p value < 0.05; **p value < 0.01 compared with untreated cells. Pulmonary pro-fibrotic activity of SARS-CoV PLpro in a mouse model. A mouse model that direct injected with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro into the mouse lung was set up for examining the pro-fibrotic activity of PLpro in vivo (Fig. 11) . The mice were injected 15 times with indicated plasmids into the chest every two days (Fig. 11A) , and then sacrificed and collected the lung tissue for tissue immunohistochemistry stain and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 11B,C) . Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-PLpro immunized sera indicated a significant expression of SARS-PLpro in lung tissues of mice injected with pSARS-PLpro, but not empty vector or solvent control (Fig. 11B ). Lung infiltration of immune cells, particular CD11b monocytes, was identified in pulmonary alveoli expressing SARS-PLpro, but not the controls, using immunohistochemistry staining with anti-mouse CD11b mAb. In addition, PLpro, but not the controls triggered a significant increase of TGF-\u03b2 1 and vimentin protein levels in the lung tissues. Subsequently, real-time PCR confirmed PLpro raised the mRNA expression of Egr-1, TSP-1, TGF-\u03b2 1, and vimentin in mouse lung tissues versus empty vector or solvent control (Fig. 11C) . Overall, result of the in vivo experiments was in accord with the in vitro data that SARS PLpro substantially stimulated Egr-1 dependent TGF-\u03b2 1 mediated pro-fibrotic responses.",

In addition, gene silencing by siRNA confirmed the importance of Egr-1 on TGF-\u03b2 1-mediated pro-fibrosis induced by PLpro (Fig. 6) . Previous studies demonstrated Egr-1 exhibiting potent stimulatory action on fibrotic gene expression, and correlating with human fibrotic disorders like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis 29, 30 . Those results revealed TGF-\u03b2 increasing Egr-1 protein and mRNA levels, stimulating Egr-1-depdent transcription of collagen, and then triggering Smad-independent fibrotic response. However, our study indicated SARS-CoV PLpro causing Egr-1-depdent transcription of TGF-\u03b2 1, in which was associated with TGF-\u03b2 1-mediated up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes (such as vimentin, GFAP, and \u03b1 -SMA). Of pro-protein convertases 19-21 , Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of TSP-1 in PLpro-expressing cells was discovered (Figs 7B and 8B) , in which TSP-1 was suggested as responsible for the Figure 10 . Analysis of STAT3 activity in p38 MAPK-mediated pathway of PLpro-induced Egr-1 up-regulation. For analysis of p38 MAPK-dependent signaling, A549 cells transfected with 10 \u03bc g of pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro were treated with or without p38 MAPK, MEK, and ERK inhibitors (SB203580, U0126, and PD98059), and then harvested for Western blotting assays with specific primary antibodies against phospho-STAT3 (A). Relative band intensity of indicated proteins was normalized by \u03b2 actin, compared to the mock cell group, and quantified using imageJ based on triplicate replicates of each experiment (B).

The study identified ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3/Egr-1 pathway involving in PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b2 1-mediated pro-fibrotic response (Fig. 12). The unique pathway has been confirmed using specific inhibitors of ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and STAT3 (Stattic) (Figs 8-10), as in accord with our previous report in that SARS-CoV PLpro triggered TGF-\u03b2 1 production via p38 MAPK mediated signaling in human promonocytes 13 . In addition, ROS was associated with the up-regulation and activation of Egr-1 in hypoxia induced pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension, apoptosis, and atherosclerosis 26,31 . The Egr-1 promoter consists of several functional response elements (such as serum response element (SRE), cAMP response element (CREs), APETALA1 (AP1), gene-specific activator protein 1 (Sp1), and Ets-family transcription factor binding sites) 31 . Several pathways of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation were identified, including MEK/ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), ERK-1/2-Elk-1 and NF-kappaB 31,32 . The increase of ROS production generally activated MAPK pathways (ERKs, JNKs, or p38 MAPKs) in response to growth factors, cytokines, and various stresses 33",
