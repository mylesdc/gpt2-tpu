[6] [7] [8] [9] However, preceding respiratory virus infection (RVI) as a potential risk factor for severe pneumococcal pneumonia was not evaluated in these studies due to the unavailability of routine virological diagnostic assays. [6] [7] [8] [9] It has been observed that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing allows the detection of various respiratory viruses and viral-bacterial co-infection might be associated with severe diseases. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Rapid molecular diagnostic techniques, such as multiplexed nucleic acid PCR assays for respiratory viral pathogens, have recently been introduced into clinical practice. In recent studies, one or more respiratory virus infections have been reported in hospitalized adult patients with CAP. [10] [11] [12] Particularly, preceding RVIs have long been regarded as a predisposing factor for pneumococcal pneumonia. 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] Viral infections cause changes in respiratory tracts, including bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, 19 stronger adhesion of pneumococci to virus-infected cells than uninfected cells, 20 decreased ciliary action, 21 damage to mucosal cells, and dysfunction of leukocytes. 20 However, studies regarding the clinical impact of preceding RVIs in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia are limited.",

Acute lower respiratory tract infection was defined as the presence of two or more of the following symptoms or signs: productive cough, fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and crackles.

In this study, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 25\u00c11% (48/191) of patients within the 30 days preceding pneumonia presentation. The most common viral pathogens detected in decreasing frequency were influenza A virus, RSV, and PIV. According to three prospective studies, bacterial-viral co-infections were present in 4-30% of adults with CAP. [10] [11] [12] In a study by Jennings et al., 12 rhinovirus was the most common virus identified from mixed viral and bacterial infections in adults with CAP, followed by RSV and influenza A virus. Our findings indicate that a quarter of patients presenting pneumococcal pneumonia had RVIs in the preceding 30 days.",

Influenza virus infection has been demonstrated as an important predisposing factor for subsequent pneumococcal pneumonia. The hypothesized synergistic interactions between the two pathogens includes epithelial damage, changes in airway function, up-regulation of receptors, and changes to innate immune response. [19] [20] [21] While the seasonal distribution of preceding RSV and HMPV infections overlapped during the winter and spring periods, the PIV infections were distributed from June to August. Interactions between pneumococcus and other respiratory viruses have also been suggested. RSV-induced impairments of macrophage or neutrophil function and cytokine signaling have increased the risk for pneumococcal infections in the murine model. 15, 16 HMPV or PIV and pneumococcus co-infections have also been demonstrated to act synergistically in the mouse model. 17, 18 During the study period, 25 (17\u00c12%) of the 142 patients with other forms of bacterial pneumonia had co-infection with RVIs: S. aureus (n = 14), H. influenzae (n = 2), P. aeruginosa (n = 3) and K. pneumoniae (n = 6). In contrast to pneumococcal pneumonia, preceding RVIs were not significantly associated with severe pneumonia in patients with other form of bacterial pneumonia.",

The limited number of case subjects who underwent laboratory tests for RVI might be associated with selection bias. The multiplex RT-PCR test for respiratory viruses has been introduced into clinical practice recently. Therefore, many clinicians have still a low level of test awareness and only the patients who had preceding or concurrent flu-like or cold symptoms were chosen for RVI testing. Secondly, the number of patients with RVIs other than influenza limited the ability to determine how different viral pathogens affect the clinical severity of pneumococcal pneumonia. Thirdly, this retrospective observational study included patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who received antibiotic therapy for \u22655 days based on the clinical diagnosis and outcome. Therefore, this study may not be representative of untreated patients of pneumococcal pneumonia. However, there were no patients who died within 5 days after admission among the 51 patients who had S. pneumoniae isolation from sputum cultures and received antibiotics therapy for <5 days. Fourthly, the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia was low in our study; this might be partly due to the exposure of antibiotics before obtaining the first blood culture in 14 (7\u00c13%) patients or the study design, which included only patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who had virolog-ical tests for RVI prior to isolating pneumococci from sputum cultures.",
