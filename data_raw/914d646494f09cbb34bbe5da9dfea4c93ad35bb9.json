Microscopy showed 2 white blood and 1 red blood cells/high-power field. Myoglobin was detected in the urine. Initial serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) was 5,614 U/L (normal <226). A nasopharyngeal specimen was tested for various respiratory pathogens by a multiplex nested polymerasechain reaction assay (FilmArray Respiratory Panels, BioFire Diagnostics Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA).

Seven cases including the current one occurred in children, and subsequent discussion refers to them. The median age was 7 years (range 4-10, mean 6.8), and two were girls. All children were healthy except a child with cerebral palsy [3] . All children presented with rhabdomyolysis within 1-5 days after the onset of fever or upper respiratory tract symptoms. Fever was reported in 86% (6/7) [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] . Myalgias involved predominantly the calves and thighs in all children but one, for which no specific description of muscle involvement was available [3] . Muscle weakness or difficulty in walking was reported in all the remaining cases and muscle swelling in 33% (2/6).",

Potential complications include acute renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, and compartment syndrome. Although influenza is the most frequently reported viral cause of rhabdomyolysis, the implementation of laboratory methods such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction assays may lead to enhanced recognition and characterization of rhabdomyolysis associated with parainfluenza or other pathogens.",
