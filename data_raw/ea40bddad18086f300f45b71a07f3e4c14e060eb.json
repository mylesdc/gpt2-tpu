In this direction, it is imperative to map minimal motifs of the B cell epitopes (BCEs) so as to avoid ZP-specific oophoritogenic T cell epitopes (TCEs) in the ZP3-based immunogens. In this study, based on known results of mapping marmoset and bonnet monkey ZP3 (mstZP3 and bmZP3), two predictable epitopes 23-30 and 301-320 on hZP3 were first confirmed and five minimal motifs within four epitopes on hZP3 were defined using serum to recombinant hZP3a 22-176 or hZP3b 177-348 as well as a biosynthetic peptide strategy. These defined minimal motifs were QPLWLL 23-28 for hZP3 23-30 , MQVTDD 103-108 for hZP3 93-110 , EENW 178-181 for hZP3 [172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187][188][189][190] , as well as SNSWF 306-310 and EGP 313-315 for hZP3 301-320 , respectively. Furthermore, the antigenicity of two peptides for hZP3 172-187 and hZP3 301-315 and specificity of the antibody response to these peptides were also evaluated, which produced high-titer antibodies in immunized animals that were capable of reacting to ZP on human oocytes, r-hZP3b 177-348 protein, as well as r-hZP3 [172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187][188][189][190] , and r-hZP3 313-320 epitope peptides fused with truncated GST188 protein.",

            "text": "The human zona pellucida (hZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding eggs, which consists of four sulfated glycoproteins designated as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4 [1, 2] . ZP glycoproteins mediate several critical events during fertilization process such as initial recognition and binding of the spermatozoa to the egg in a species-specific manner, induction of the acrosome reaction in the zona-bound spermatozoon, and prevention of polyspermy [3, 4] . By virtue of their critical role during fertilization, ZP glycoproteins have been proposed as target for developing contraceptive vaccines [5, 6] . Although active immunization with purified or recombinant ZP (r-ZP) proteins induces infertility in various mammalian species, the contraceptive efficacy is invariably associated with either transient alteration or complete loss of ovarian function [7] [8] [9] [10] . The observed ovarian pathology following active immunization with ZP antigens may be due to (i) presence of ZP-specific T-cell epitopes (TCE) within a B-cell epitope (BCE), for example peptide corresponding to mouse ZP3 (mZP3) amino acid (aa) residues 330-342 (peptide 330-342 ) [11] , (ii) autoimmune ovarian disease (AOD) that can be adoptively transferred by the ZP3 peptide-activated CD4 + T-cells to na\u00efve recipients but does not occur when only antipeptide antibodies are administered [12] , and (iii) the minimal and modified BCE peptide 335-342 of mZP3, which had no longer a ZP-specific TCE (phenylalanine, a key residue of the \"oophoritogenic\" TCE, substituted by alanine), induced infertility in mice with eight different haplotypes without any AOD when it was co-linearly synthesized with a foreign \"promiscuous\" TCE [13] .",

Therefore, efforts have been made by several laboratories to delineate infertility-associated BCEs of ZP proteins since a BCE on mZP3 was first identified by Dean et al. [14] . For instance, five BCE peptides 45-64, 93-110, 137-150, 172-190 and 334-341 of hZP3 have been mapped [15] [16] [17] and additional two epitopes corresponding to aa residue 23-30 and 301-320 of hZP3 have also been predicted based on the mapping results of marmoset ZP3 (mstZP3) and bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata; bmZP3) proteins [18, 19] , because their aa sequences are highly conserved among mstZP3 and hZP3 as well as bmZP3 and hZP3 proteins. To eliminate potential oophoritis-inducing TCE within a mapped longer BCE peptide, the identification of minimal motif of mapped BCEs on hZP3 has been hampered due to the limitation of available mapping methods. So far, only the minimal motif of the BCE on the C-terminus of hZP3 has been identified using rabbit serum [16] .",

As shown in Figure 1 (a), P4-P11 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. Surprisingly, the electrophoretic mobilities of some short peptides fused with truncated GST188 did not seem to match their molecular weight, such as, 20mer P5 protein (Figure 1(a) , Lane 3) migrated similarly to that of 14mer P7 protein (Lane 5) than to that of 18mer P6 protein (Lane 4) and so on. Although this aberrant behavior cannot be explained at present, these electrophoretic results should be reliable as their respective nt sequence matched with the aa sequence. Further, expression of the respective fusion protein was not observed in the uninduced clones (data not shown). Six peptides (P4, P6, P8, P9, P10, and P11) of hZP3 could be recognized by antiserum against r-hZP3a or r-hZP3b, but P5 and P7 failed to react with both the immune sera in Western blot (Figure 1(b) ). The results confirmed three BCE peptides (P6, P9, and P11) of hZP3 out of five BCE peptides identified previously. All three predicted BCE peptides also reacted with antibodies against r-hZPa/r-hZP3b. In a word, this study showed that there at least were five BCE peptides on hZP3 protein. P6, P9, and P10 were selected to identify their minimal motifs with sera to r-hZP3a or r-hZP3b, except P11 that its motif has been known [16] . Four sets of thirty-seven 6-8mer peptides with an overlap of 5-7 aa residues for P4, P6, P9, and P10 peptide were constructed and used to map minimal motifs in this study. All P4 and P12 to P46 peptides were expressed in E. coli at a higher level (Figure 2 (a), others not shown). As shown in Figure 2 , three (b-c), two (d), as well as four and six (e) overlapping 6-8mer peptides fused with GST188 were recognized by serum against r-hZP3a or r-hZP3b. These 36 constructs shared sequences of 6 aa (P4 and P6), 7 aa (P9), as well as 5 aa and 3 aa (P10), respectively ( Figure 3 ). Thus, their minimal binding motifs were localized to residues QPLWLL 23-28 , MQVTDD 103-108 , EENWNAE 178-184 , SNSWF 306-310 , and EGP 313-315 on the epitope peptides P4, P6, P9, and P10, of which two minimal motifs on peptide P10 were identified, suggesting that there were two nested BCEs on it. Additionally, we prejudged that the peptide P8 of hZP3 172-181 should be recognized by serum to r-hZP3b, because the mapped epitope sequence 171-180 of mZP3 [25] is 100% conserved among mZP3 and hZP3 at the amino acid level. However, they did not generate a blotted brown band at the position of Stv108-P8 fusion protein when initially using DAB coloration due to its relatively lower sensitivity (result not shown). Therefore, a set of P4-P11 peptides fused with GST188 was again constructed, which were suited to chemoluminescence detection on the blotted membrane and then identified when using high-sensitivity ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents. As a result, the peptides P8 and P9 were recognized by serum to r-hZP3b (Figure 1(b) , lanes 6-7). Thus, the minimal motif 178-181 of peptide P9 was finally defined according to the shared sequences of 4 aa residues (EENW) between P8 and the minimal motif of hZP3 178-184 mapped initially.",

Two BCEs 137-150 and 334-341 on hZP3 were first identified with se-rum to each synthetic peptide based on computer prediction or sequence comparison of a known BCE sequence of mZP3 with other ZP3 protein in many mammals [15, 16] . The former 14 mer peptide 137-150 (P7) of hZP3, however, was not recognized by both sera to r-hZP3 in ELISA [17] and serum to r-hZP3a in Western blotting (Figure 1(b) , Lane 5), suggesting that it might not be a self-epitope peptide of hZP3, although it could elicit antibody capable of binding to native hZP and its antiserum might be used as a marker for the identification of hZP3 protein [15] . For the latter 8 mer peptide 334-341 (P11) that elicited antibodies reacting to human ZP in transgenic mice [16] , although it failed to be identified by serum to r-hZP3 in the study on epitope mapping of hZP3 [17] , the result that peptide P11 could be recognized by serum to r-hZP3b in this study (Figure 1(b) , lane 9) suggested that it should be an epitope of hZP3. As well, the 20 mer peptide 45-64 (P5) of hZP3 mapped by serum to r-hZP3 [17] , it could not react to serum to r-hZP3b in this study (Figure 1(b) , Lane 3). At present, we cannot explain these distinct mapping results, including the abovementioned 8mer peptide 334-341 , because both groups employed different antisera (against r-hZP3 22-460 and r-hZP3a , resp.). The antigenicity and immunogenicity of hZP3 172-190 [17] , mstZP3 301-320 [18, 26] , and bmZP3 300-322 [27] were previously reported. These synthetic peptides elicited antibodies capable of reacting to native mstZP, bmZP, and hZP, respectively. The peptide sequence 301-320 is highly conserved between mstZP3 and bmZP3 sequences. The mst-serum tomstZP3 301-320 linked to a promiscuous helper TCE from tetanus toxoid showed up to 60% of inhibition in human sperm-zona binding in vitro [26] . Conversely, the bm-serum to bmZP3 300-322 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid failed to show any significant decrease in sperm-zona binding in hemizona assay [27] . The reasons for this discordance are not clear and more research is required to explain these findings.",

As shown in Figures 4 and 5 , peptides P1 and P2 elicited high-titer antibodies reacting with native hZP and r-hZP3b peptide expressed in E. coli, but the antigenicity of the latter was significantly greater than that of the former. For the antigenic diversity of peptides P1 and P2, one possible explanation might be because there were antibodies against two overlapping BCEs (NSNWF 306-310 and EGP 313-315 ) within the peptide P2 sequence. As for the efficacy of each antiserum to inhibit human sperm-zona binding, it remains to be further evaluated by carrying out competitive hemizona or spermegg binding assays. The serum to a synthetic peptide was often used to map minimal motif of identified BCE peptide [16, 28] . To further check the specificity of peptides P1 and P2 as antigen, the Western blotting was carried out with two sets of 8 mer peptides (P27\u223cP33 and P34\u223cP46) . Surprisingly, the rabbit serum to P1 not only could recognize peptides P28 and P29, but also reacted with peptides P30 and P31 that were not recognized by rabbit serum to r-hZP3b, whereas the serum to P2 only recognized peptides P42 and P43, but did not recognize other peptides (P43-P46) reacted with serum to r-hZP3b (data not shown). The data suggested that their BCE motifs generated a \"drifting\" phenomenon when using serum against synthetic peptide P1 or P2 to map minimal motif compared with the result identified with serum to r-hZP3b, that is, the minimal motifs mapped with serum to a synthetic peptide and to a native or r-protein might be different sometimes.",

For instances the following hold. (1) Only 3 BCEs on hZP3, not including a BCE on its C-terminus transmembrane-like domain, were mapped with serum to CHO-expressed r-hZP3 [17] compared with the result of mapped 6 BCEs in this study. (2) It could not be defined how many BCEs there were in six of potential reactive neighboring 15mer-peptides (P5-P8, P11-P12, P14-P18, P31-P33, P38-P39, and P43-P44) in the epitope mapping of brushtail possum (bp) ZP2 40-634 with sera to r-bpZP2 40-311/305-634 [32] , which might be one of causes why several BCE peptides could be missed or could not be defined in above two epitope mapping studies using synthetic peptide library. As we know, there may be only one BCE on mapped two neighboring overlapping peptides because they share a common sequence [33] , but there may also be two or three BCEs according to our other epitope mapping results of E6, E7, and L1 proteins from HPV type 58 virus (data not shown). It obviously is a drawback to employ this method to map all BCEs on a protein, because it could not be used to carry out minimal motif identification of each reactive neighboring peptide with serum to r-protein, which is a way of answering how many BCEs there are on them.",

However, not like the above studies using mAb, chicken sera to SARS-CoV, and SARS convalescent sera, it needs to solve a key problem to employ serum against r-protein, that is, how to avoid interfering of antibodies against some strong antigens from E. coli on distinguishing target blotted bands. Because any r-protein used as immunogen always contains a little bacteria proteins that could not be completely removed when purified at laboratory level. At present, this problem has been solved through using a truncated GST188 or Stv108 as carrier of short peptide expression. As showed in Figure 1 , the blotted bands of the GST188-short peptides were to be located in a weak antigenic area of bacterial proteins on blotted membrane, which avoided two blotted bands of bacterial protein with 21 kDa and 31 kDa bands. Obviously, besides simple, cheap, reliable, and adaptable merits mentioned in our previous work [20] , the present study showed another two distinct advantages of our improved biosynthetic peptide strategy: (1) it permits using serum against bacteria-expressed protein to map BCEs and their minimal motifs on (c-f) matching light images for the human oocytes imaged by immunofluorescence in panels g-j. (g-j) reactivity of rabbit sera to P1 or P2 with human oocyte by indirect immunofluorescence. Representative immunofluorescence patterns are shown for (g) preimmune serum; (h) immune serum only received CFA (i-j) immune serum to P1 or P2. the target protein; (2) the 8mer-20mer peptide fusion proteins expressed by pXXGST-1 or pXXStv-3 plasmid could be used in Western blotting without purifying. In addition, the smallest binding motif of 3 residues for antibodies can be defined with biosynthetic peptides (Figure 2 (e) and Figure 3 ), whereas the length mapped with synthetic peptides method was 4-5 residues [37] . In summary, this study is the first to utilize biosynthetic peptides and sera against r-hZP3a and/or r-hZP3b to map BCEs and their minimal motifs on hZP3 protein. The identification of five minimal motifs within four epitopes on hZP3 will help in developing contraceptive vaccines of multiepitope ZP peptides without ZP-specific TCE activities which may result in ovarian dysfunction for human use in future, and those defined BCE minimal motifs of hZP3 would be also used as specific probes to detect whether there are self-ZP antibodies to each BCE in the sera from patients with infertile and/or premature ovarian failure. Furthermore, the data presented here again clearly suggest that the biosynthetic peptide strategy employed in this study could be used to map all BCEs and precise linear epitopes on other entire ZP proteins in any species.",
