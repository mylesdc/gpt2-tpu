Upon infection, chikungunya fever (CHIKF) can result in long-term joint pain and arthritis, and despite intense research, no licensed vaccine for CHIKV is available. We have developed two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1) that induce swift and robust anti-CHIKV immune responses with a single dose, without the need for adjuvants or booster vaccines. Here, we report the vaccines' protective efficacies against CHIKV infection in a lethal A129 mouse model. Our results indicate that a single, un-adjuvanted ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap dose provided complete protection against a lethal virus challenge and prevented CHIKV-associated severe inflammation. These candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 CHIKV reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects, such as weight loss. Vaccination with either ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection, indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested. We conclude that both replication-deficient ChAdOx1 Chik vaccines are safe even when used in A129 mice and afford complete protection from a lethal challenge.",

Several, large-scale outbreaks have resulted in millions of infections worldwide [1] . Unlike many other arboviruses of clinical importance, the percentage of CHIKV infections resulting in symptomatic disease is high and the chronic phase of the illness can last for years [2] . Co-morbidities can exacerbate disease (reviewed in [3] ). Furthermore, swelling and arthritis at the peripheral joints in the hands and feet results in a debilitating disease that directly affects the patient's quality of life and places a burden on local caretakers and communities [2] . At present, there are no licensed treatments against CHIKF, and despite efforts made for over 50 years, no licensed vaccine for CHIKV is yet available (reviewed in [4, 5] ).",

            "text": "Adenoviruses have been used as viral vectors for decades. Recently, novel adenoviruses were prioritized, mainly due to pre-existing adenovirus immunity to common serotypes (e.g., Ad5) in the targeted human populations. Simian adenoviruses have been developed following concerns that pre-existing immunity to human adenoviral serotypes could limit their use as vaccines. Indeed, simian adenoviruses have minimal seroprevalence in humans [6] . The first report using a chimpanzee adenovirus as a viral-vectored vaccine was made in 2002 by Xiang et al. [7] , who demonstrated the induction of immune responses to a rabies glycoprotein expressed by a chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68. A novel vaccine vector was recently derived from the chimpanzee adenovirus isolate Y25 subgroup E. This viral vector known as ChAdOx1 was engineered at the University of Oxford as a replication-incompetent virus by deletion of its E1 region [8] . Recombinant ChAdOx1 vectors have successfully been used in vaccines against a wide variety of pathogens [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, phase I clinical trials with ChAdOx viral vectors against diseases such as influenza (NCT01818362, NCT01623518), tuberculosis (NCT01829490, NCT03681860), MERS (NCT03399578), HIV (NCT03204617), malaria (NCT03203421), and meningitidis B (ISRCTN46336916) have demonstrated their safety and immunogenicity.",

Importantly, even the lowest weight recorded for each mouse along the whole post challenge period was significantly higher in ChAdOx1 Chik, ChAdOx1 Chik \u0394Cap, and 181/25 groups compared to PBS (Figure 3b ). One of the advantages of the A129 mouse model for studying CHIKV infection is the ability to measure survival following a challenge. In addition to protection from weight loss, all mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1 Chik and ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap vaccines survived the challenge with CHIKV-LR (Table 1 ). These groups were significantly different from the PBS group, which failed to protect mice and resulted in morbidity, triggering euthanasia between days 4 and 5 post-challenge. The off-target ChAdOx1 Zika-vaccinated mice showed no statistically significant difference from PBS-treated mice ( Table 1) . Swelling is a hallmark of CHIKV infection in the injected foot. All mice that survived infection were also fully protected from swelling at the injection site. Conversely, all mice with weight loss and lethal disease had significant swelling starting on day 2 post challenge, which failed to resolve. Swelling was only seen in the CHIKV infected (left rear) foot and not the contralateral (right rear) control foot (Figure 4a ). Swelling rapidly increased in PBS and ChAdOx1 Zika groups, peaking on day 4 post infection and failing to resolve before the animals reached the humane endpoint and were euthanized (Figure 4b ). There was no significant swelling seen in ChAdOx1 Chik, ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap, or 181/25-vaccinated mice, in either foot (Figure 4a,b) . Previous studies have shown that viremia in A129 mice occurs on days 1-3 [15] . Therefore, to determine if the vaccine could protect against viremia, blood was taken from all mice on day 2 post challenge, which corresponds to the predicted day of peak viremia [15] . Consistent with survival and foot swelling, only the mice that were PBS-treated or ChAdOx1 Zika-vaccinated had a viremia of approximately 6 log10 pfu/mL ( Figure 5) . None of the other vaccinated mice had detectable viremia. Previous studies have shown that viremia in A129 mice occurs on days 1-3 [15] .

Human adenoviruses have been developed as CHIKV viral-vectored vaccines, and they have been shown to induce robust immune responses in mice [17, 18] . These vaccines were tested in C57BL/6 mice, which produce high levels of neutralizing antibody against CHIKV. Foot infection of CHIKV in this mouse strain is not lethal and vaccines' efficacy measurements include absence of viremia and protection from swelling. The present results are similar to the previous studies in that both ChAdOx1 Chik and ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap vaccines trigger a protective immune response. The main correlate of protection against CHIKV-caused disease is likely to be neutralizing antibodies, based on a variety of studies [19, 20] . All vaccinated mice in this study had measurable PRNT 80 titers, with neutralizing antibodies above the ones necessary to neutralize CHIKV, albeit at lower levels than expected. This could be due to the mouse strain (C57BL/6 versus A129), level of immunocompetency (type I interferon competent versus deficient) and/or mouse age. The A129 mouse model is a sensitive model for CHIKV-caused disease; therefore, a lack of interferon type I response may negatively influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, pairing this vaccine with appropriate adjuvants may improve the production of neutralizing antibodies and immunity against CHIKV. Human adenovirus vectored vaccines work well in mice with no pre-existing immunity to these adenoviruses. However, due to the high seroprevalence of the most popular human adenoviruses in the population [21, 22] , other primate adenoviruses with lower human seroprevalence like gorilla and chimpanzee ones have been pursued [6, 23, 24] . These primate adenoviruses have been shown here and by others to be effective vector platforms [9] [10] [11] [12] 23, 25, 26] .",

            "text": "The strain of mouse chosen for vaccine studies for CHIKV disease is critical, since the measures of vaccine efficacy are strain dependent. Here, we use mice lacking the ability to respond to type I interferons because they are highly susceptible to lethal CHIKV infection [27] . A129 mice have been used successfully to test CHIKV vaccines since any vaccine that fails to produce a potent antibody response fails to protect against CHIKV challenge [28] . All ChAdOx1 CHIKV-vaccinated mice were protected in this model, even at a high challenge dose, highlighting the robustness of the single-dose vaccination. Furthermore, high titer viremias are produced from CHIKV infection in A129 mice [15] , and ChAdOx1 CHIKV vaccines were able to reduce challenge viremia levels to undetectable levels on the day of highest anticipated titer. This feature is critical for arbovirus vaccines as it decreases the potential for mosquito transmission. Despite their usefulness in evaluating safety and efficacy, A129 mice also show mortality following CHIKV, which is not observed in CHIKV-infected patients. C57Bl/6 mice are often used for vaccine studies since they have a fully-intact type I interferon response, show foot swelling, and do not succumb to CHIKV infection. Given that the ChAdOx1 CHIK vaccines described here are safe and effective, further characterization, including dosing and long-term immunogenicity studies in C57Bl/6 mice is warranted. The ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines described here were designed to express a multi-lineage mosaic protein with the aim to widen protection against all CHIKV lineages [14] . We hypothesized that as neutralizing antibodies against the CHIKV surface antigens correlate with protection, the capsid being the most internal structural protein might be less of a requirement to induce effective immunity. To test this, we designed an alternative vaccine with a CHIKV structural cassette lacking the capsid gene. There were no significant differences in survival, viremia, or weight loss between ChAdOx1 Chik-and ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap-vaccinated mice following lethal CHIKV challenge under the conditions tested. Nevertheless, we are aware that differences in protection may emerge as conditions change, such as a reduction in vaccine dose or the assessment of long-term efficacy afforded in the presence or absence of the capsid as part of the vaccine.",

Recent scientific efforts have resulted in promising CHIKV candidate vaccines, going from pre-clinical to phase I and II clinical trials; however, no vaccine has yet been licensed. There are multiple vaccines in development using a wide variety of approaches, including live-attenuated, protein subunit, viral-vectored, and nucleic acid-derived [4, 30] . Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks. The chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored approach used here combines an enhanced safety profile on par with inactivated vaccines (as evidenced by no significant weight loss in A129 mice directly following vaccination) and immunogenicity comparable to live-attenuated vaccines (as shown by lack of viremia and swelling as well as survival of the lethal challenge).

            "text": "The viral-vectored vaccines constructed at the University of Oxford consisted of a chimpanzee adenoviral vector platform, ChAdOx1, which has a deleted E1 locus responsible for viral replication and the E3 gene [8] . The genetic cassette designed based on structural sequences of CHIKV was inserted into the Early gene (E1) that was deleted from the ChAdOx1 vector using an attR1 attR2 Gateway \u00ae cassette (Invitrogen). The degree of conservation was analyzed and a consensus sequence from the three CHIKV lineages was utilized in the design of the synthetic gene. We constructed two vaccines, one with the whole structural cassette (ChAdOx1 Chik) and one without capsid (ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap). ChAdOx1 Chik contains the full-length polyprotein of CHIKV, including capsid, 6k, and envelope (E) 3, E2, and E1. This plasmid was used as DNA template to further generate the E3, E2, 6K, E1 cassette with deletion of the capsid (ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap) by PCR cloning. Transgenes were cloned into a pMono plasmid, under the control of a CMV promoter. More details have been described before [14] . ChAdOx1 Zika (Zika prME \u2206TM) was used as a negative control [13] . The presence of the inserted cassettes into the ChAdOx1 vector was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Virus were purified by cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient ultracentrifugation and assessed for sterility. The resulting products were titrated to obtain infectious units (IU) per mL and assayed by spectrophotometry to measure the number of virus particles (vp) per mL. ChAdOx1 Chik titer was 5.7 \u00d7 10 9 IU/mL with a ratio of vp:IU of 29. ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap titer was 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 IU/mL with a ratio of vp:IU of 83. ChAdOx1 Zika titer was 1 \u00d7 10 10 IU/mL with a ratio of vp:IU of 94. Vaccine excipient was made of 10mM Tris, 7.5% sucrose, 150nM NaCl, 0.1% Tween80 at pH 7.8. ChAdOx1 Chik, ChAdOx1 Chik \u2206Cap, and ChAdOx1 Zika were manufactured by the Viral Vector Core Facility at the Jenner Institute from the University of Oxford. CHIKV 181/25 vaccine was rescued from a cDNA clone as described in [31] . The 181/25 vaccine was developed by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) by passaging the Southeast Asian human isolate 15561 in MRC-5 cells 18 times [32] . Stocks were titrated from tissue culture media as listed above and frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until ready to use. A cDNA clone encoding the LR strain of CHIKV was used to rescue the virus used in the challenge. Information regarding cDNA construction and rescue have been reported [33] .",
