            "text": "Senecavirus A (SV-A), formerly, Seneca Valley virus (SVV), has been detected in swine with vesicular lesions and is thought to be associated with swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD), a vesicular disease syndrome that lacks a defined causative agent. The clinical presentation of SIVD resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS), that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to lift restrictions on animal quarantine, movement, and trade. This study presents the development of a sensitive, SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable for detection of SV-A in diagnostic swine specimens. After testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease, 44 (88%) were found to be positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease, indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population. SV-A RNA was also detectable at a low level in sera from a subset of pigs that presented with (18%) or without (6%) vesicular signs. In 2015, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SV-A in the US, and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method. SV-A RNA was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions, oral and snout epithelium, oral swabs, scabs, and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node. Genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates. Fig 2. DNA doubling efficiency.",

The primary sequence analysis of the conserved polypeptide regions (P1, 2C, 3C and 3D) of the first isolate (SVV-001) showed that the virus is most closely related to cardioviruses in the family of Picornaviridae [2] . The single-stranded RNA genome of SV-A displays the secondary structural features of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that resembles the IRES element of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) of the family Flaviviridae, giving rise to the possibility that genetic exchange may have occurred between members of Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae during persistent co-infection in pigs [3] . Importantly, SV-A is a natural oncolytic agent, with the ability to selectively replicate in; and kill human tumor cells of neuroendocrine origin, thus, the virus is being advanced as a tool for potential therapeutic intervention of cancer [4] .",

            "text": "Swine are considered to be the natural hosts of SV-A and all known SV-A sequenced isolates have been obtained from pigs. Previously, by regression analysis of partial genome sequences, it was suggested that different isolates of SV-A had a common ancestor and were assumed to have been introduced into the US pig populations (http://www.europic.org.uk/Europic2006/posters/ Knowles.svv.01.pdf). Virus isolated in cell culture from tissue specimens of a diseased pig presenting vesicular lesions on the snout and feet in 2005, was identified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories' (NVSL) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) as SV-A using a broad pan-viral microarray (unpublished data). More recently, this vesicular disease syndrome, with as yet unidentified etiology, has been termed swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD) [5, 6] . Despite the isolation of SV-A in cell culture, FADDL has been unsuccessful at reproducing clinical signs by experimental inoculation of pigs with live virus. Negative observations were also made by other laboratories who conducted animal inoculations with multiple SV-A isolates [7] . Singh et al (2012) proposed SV-A as the causative agent of SIVD from a detailed clinical, diagnostic and histopathological study on a Chester White boar suffering from anorexia, lethargy, lameness and vesicular lesions [8] . However, association of SV-A with SIVD, or as the sole causative agent, is speculative at this time since the virus has also been isolated from pigs lacking clinical disease [2] . SIVD has been reported in pigs in the continents of North America and Australia [6, [9] [10] [11] . Although SIVD itself does not pose an economic concern, veterinary diagnosis from clinical signs is complicated since similar vesicular lesions can be formed due to common viral infections such as parvovirus, enterovirus, toxins in food supply, or burns [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Additionally, SIVD clinically resembles high consequence transboundary animal diseases (TADs) such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), vesicular stomatitis (VS), and vesicular exanthema of swine (VES). A few laboratory methods have been developed for detection of SV-A including a virus serum antibody neutralizing test and a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (cELISA), which are not widely available [7, 17] . The principal aim of this study was to develop a specific real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for fast, sensitive, and quantitative detection of SV-A RNA in vesicular diagnostic tissues.",

First strand synthesis of cDNA was performed with random primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by incubation for 5 min at 65\u00b0C. Immediately afterwards, an additional 1ul of Superscript III was added to the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at 50\u00b0C. Second strand synthesis was performed by addition of Sequenase enzyme (Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA); followed by a ramped incubation to 37\u00b0C for 16 min followed by 2 min at 94\u00b0C. Subsequently, the 37\u00b0C incubation was repeated with the addition of Sequenase, and the final product was amplified using TaqR mastermix (Clontech/Takara) using manufacturers' recommended conditions. The resulting double stranded amplicon was processed for producing the sequencing library using a Nextera DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturers' protocol.

All of these diagnostic specimens, listed in Table 2 , were previously diagnosed negative for the presence of high-consequence porcine vesicular diseases including FMDV, VSV, VESV, and SVDV, but all possible endemic vesicular disease rule outs were not evaluated. A total of 67 (79% of total specimens analyzed) diagnostic specimens, representing 44 (i.e., 88% of animals tested) clinical animals, showed detectable amplification plots with Ct values ranging between 11 to 38 and Tm values of approximately 78\u00b0C, indicating detectable SV-A in those specimens (summarized in Table 2 ). A slight variation in Tm of products was observed and expected due to known variations in base composition of target amplicon sequences among different isolates and also due to differences of ramping and Tm collection rates of the thermal cyclers used. Thus, the products which contained a single melting peak with positive CT values produced Tm values within the range of 77.7 to 80.8\u00b0C, with a mean of 79.3\u00b0C. Melting temperature parameters fell within the range of 79.3\u00b0C \u00b11.6\u00b0C. SV-A RNA was found in a variety of different types of clinical specimens including vesicular fluid, epithelium, lymph node, swabs and epithelium from hoof lesion, etc., (Table 2 ). Of note, many of the vesicular diagnostic specimens were also found positive for the presence of one or more common viruses such as circovirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, pestivirus, etc., suggesting frequent co-infections of SV-A with other porcine viruses in field animals. Thirteen RT-qPCR positive samples were also tested by the conventional RT-PCR assay, confirming SV-A presence in all samples. Similarly, 18 RT-qPCR negative samples were confirmed for absence of SV-A particles by conventional RT-PCR assay and RNA integrity was confirmed present using the beta-actin RT-qPCR as previously described (data not shown). A control panel comprised of tissues from 35 swine known to be free of clinical vesicular disease were tested and found negative for the presence of SV-A RNA by RT-qPCR (Table 3) . While none of the negative cohort tissue specimens yielded detectable SV-A RNA, 121 serum specimens collected from domestic and feral swine with or without clinical complications of vesicular lesions were also tested for SV-A particles and 18% from clinically diseased animals displayed very low amplification plots (i.e., high Ct values near 38) and produced expected positive melting curves, suggesting a weak but detectable presence of SV-A RNA in these animals (Table 3) . Similar weak detection was also evidenced in 5.5% of serum from disease-free animals, of 47 feral and 35 domestic species, 6 (3 from each group) were found to contain SV-A RNA by RT-qPCR (Table 3 ). In 2013, 54 swine vesicular diagnostic specimens submitted for SV-A analysis were found to be positive by qRT-PCR. In 2014, only 14 specimens submitted for SV-A analysis were positive by qRT-PCR, and as of October 2015, 53 vesicular case investigations out 101 received by FADDL, have been determined positive by qRT-PCR ( Fig  6) . In total, 216 specimens submitted have been determined SV-A positive by qRT-PCR, and over 159 specimens have been confirmed SV-A qRT-PCR positive after virus isolation through November 2015 (Table 4 ).

            "text": "Detection of SV-A antibodies in field animals with vesicular lesions has been attributed to possible association of the virus with SIVD syndrome [4, 5] . Differential diagnosis of SIVD from high consequence vesicular animal diseases, such as FMD, is crucial due to trade and Real-Time PCR Detection of SV-A in Domestic Swine movement restriction and other economic impacts associated with foreign animal diseases. Therefore, FADDL routinely investigates the presence of SV-A as the possible cause of vesicular lesions in swine while performing priority diagnosis from other devastating vesicular diseases including FMD by respective disease-specific RT-qPCR assays. The SV-A RT-qPCR test developed in this study complemented our laboratory needs for a fast, specific, sensitive and quantitative assay. Once demonstrated as sensitive, specific and reproducible in feasibility studies, we applied it to analyze swine vesicular diagnostic specimens that were previously found negative of the foreign animal disease agents FMD, VS, SVD and VES. Surprisingly, 88% of animals with vesicular lesions were positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR, confirming the previous observation that the virus appears to be associated with SIVD [7] . The SV-A conventional PCR was previously performed upon request only, and the SVV qRT-PCR assay was only performed regularly starting in June 2015 on all swine vesicular investigation submissions, due to the increased prevalence of the virus. The virus was detected in several types of tissue specimens suggesting that it is ubiquitously distributed in different organs of an infected animal. Some of the RNA templates demonstrated very low Ct values (<14) suggesting a high presence of SV-A Real-Time PCR Detection of SV-A in Domestic Swine particles in those specimens. Additionally, the virus could not be detected in any of the tissues from the 35 pigs that did not possess SIVD signature clinical signs. Previously, the presence of SV-A neutralizing antibody was found in sera from pigs irrespective of the disease status [http://www.europic.org.uk/Europic2006/posters/Knowles.svv.01. pdf]. In this study, we were able to directly detect the low levels of SV-A RNA, presumably viral genome, in 27% of sera from swine with or without SIVD symptoms. This included 3 feral swine indicating that wildlife can serve as the possible natural reservoir of the virus. Recently, Yang et al 2012 [6] described the development of a SV-A indirect and cELISA assays which could be used for specific detection of SV-A serum antibodies. While farm animals are routinely monitored for appearance of vesicular lesions and precautionary laboratory diagnoses are done on suspect animals, feral swine are less frequently observed for vesicular disease. Pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown, and a cause for the observed high frequency of SV-A infection in animals presenting with vesicular disease is not yet understood. It is likely that environmental stressors or other infectious agents may be required in addition to SV-A for induction of SIVD. This assumption is supported by our frequent detection of other porcine viruses along with SV-A in clinical field animals and on an observed correlation from case histories indicating stressful conditions, such as movement, and the presence of SV-A in vesicular tissues presented in Table 2 . An additional factor complicating the understanding of pathogenicity is the potential for sequence variation between strains of SV-A. Employing sensitive and specific detection methods for SV-A in rule-out diagnostic investigations of high consequence vesicular diseases in swine may not only help to resolve such disease investigations but ultimately may help to better understand the factors contributing to the presentation of SIVD.",
