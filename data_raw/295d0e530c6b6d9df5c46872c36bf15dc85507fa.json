Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, W\u0113 nzh\u014du virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province.",

Mammarenavirus particles are spherical to pleomorphic in shape and, range from 40 to 300 nm in diameter [2] . The virus particle carries a variable number of ribosomes (20-25 nm) from host cells that are responsible for their sandy, or arena-like, appearance under electron microscopy [3] . Mammarenavirus possess a bi-segmented, ambisense, single-stranded RNA genome. The L and S segments share conserved sequences at both ends and are around 7.2 and 3.5 kb long, respectively [4] . Each genomic RNA encodes two different proteins in opposite orientations [5] . The two open reading frames (ORFs) in each segment are separated by an intergenic noncoding region that forms one or more energetically stable stem-loop (hairpin) structures [6] . The L segment encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, L) and a zinc binding matrix protein (Z). The S segment encodes a nucleoprotein (NP) and an envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) [2] .",

Most mammarenaviruses induce a persistent and frequently asymptomatic infection in their reservoir hosts and are associated with a specific host species or group of species [10] . Mammarenaviruses can be transmitted through rodent urine or blood [11] . Humans usually become infected through contact with infected rodents or inhalation of infectious rodent excreta or secretions [2] . Animal models, such as hamsters, mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates, have been used to study the pathogenicity of mammarenaviruses and to measure vaccine or drug efficacy [12] . Viral infections have been identified in many organs, including the spleen, liver, adrenal gland, placenta, and lungs [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that WENV is prevalent in three of five Rattus species and one Tupaia species in three [8, 9, 22, [24] [25] [26] . No mammarenavirus was detected in other locations, suggesting that the distribution of these viruses may currently be limited to these three regions. However, considering the movement of rodents due to ecological changes, we cannot exclude the possibility of these viruses spreading in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to continue surveillance for these viruses in their natural reservoirs. Sequences analysis of five full-length genomes showed that these discovered viruses are in fact closely related to WENVs, which indicated a common ancestor. But the diversity within that clade also revealed an independent lineage of Asian arenaviruses [8, 9, 22, 24, 25] . The phylogenetic tree based on partial L sequences had different shape with the tree based on complete length of L segment suggesting more complexity evolution of WENV. Meanwhile, the tree topologies for the L and S segments of the Yunnan isolates are also incongruent. In the L tree, the Yunnan strains are separated according to the two sampling locations irrespective of host species, while two strains from different locations are closely related in the S tree (Fig 3) . Recombination analysis suggested that one of the Yunnan strains, WENV/Rn2016YM03, results from an S segment recombination event between WENV/Rn2016YL04 and WENV/ Rt2015YM16. We hypothesize that the divergence of the viruses between the two locations is a recent event caused by host movement. More evolution models and more viruses complete genome sequences were needed to improve the understanding of WENV evolution.",

In this study, we have gained both molecular and serological evidence to demonstrate that brown rats (R. norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi) are the major natural host of WENVs. In Yunnan, these two rodent species are the dominant species and commensal with humans, suggesting a high risk of spillover of WENVs and occurrence of similar respiratory illness cases caused by WENV infection. Thus the ELISA method developed in this study can serve as a tool for screening WENV antibodies in undiagnosed fever patients. In Yunnan Province, the Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HRFS) and Dengue fever are also occurring, which may lead to the misdiagnosis of the disease caused by WENVs or other mammarenaviruses. The ELISA test for WENV antibodies will reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, though the results need to be further verified by virus neutralization assay.",
