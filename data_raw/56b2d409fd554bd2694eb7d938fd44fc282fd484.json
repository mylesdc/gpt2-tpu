We here aimed at investigating the possibility to target the HSV-1 G4s by a core extended naphtalene diimide (c-exNDI) G4 ligand. Biophysical and biomolecular analysis proved that c-exNDI stabilized the HSV-1 G4s in a concentration dependent manner. In MS competition assays, c-exNDI preferentially recognized HSV-1 G4s over cellular telomeric G4s, the most represented G4s within cells; other less abundant cellular G4s were also recognized. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with c-exNDI at low nanomolar concentrations induced significant virus inhibition with no cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action was ascribed to G4-mediated inhibition of viral DNA replication, with consequent impairment of viral genes transcription. Our data suggest that the observed potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity mainly depend on a combination of c-exNDI affinity for HSV-1 G4s and their massive presence during infection. HSV-1 G4s may thus represent new effective antiviral targets: the fact that no current antiherpetic drug exploits them and their presence at the viral genome, responsible for both active and latent HSV infections, makes them particularly attracting.",

Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K + cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability 2 . Based on the strand orientation, G4s can adopt three main topologies: parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid-type structures. In eukaryotes, G4s have been shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination 3-7 . Expansion of G-quadruplex-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders 4, 8, 9 . Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s 10, 11 and the development of G4 specific antibodies 12, 13 .",

Templates corresponding to un2, un3 and gp054a sequences (Table S1 ) were annealed to a primer and incubated with Taq polymerase for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C. A sequence unable to fold into G4 was alongside assayed as negative control. In the absence of K + , un2 and gp054a displayed a marked stop site corresponding to the first G of the most 3\u2032 G-tract (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 un2 and gp054) , indicating stable G4 folding. The stop site increased upon addition of K + and c-exNDI (Fig. 2a, lanes 2-5 un2 and gp054) ; moreover, in the presence of the compound the full-length amplified product sharply decreased, indicating effective stabilization of un2 and gp054a G4s and thus inhibition of polymerase progression (Fig. 2a, lanes 3-5 un2 and gp054) . In the absence of K + no stop site was observed in the un3 sequence, which thus did not form G4 in these conditions (Fig. 2a , lane 1 un3); upon addition of K + and c-exNDI, a marked stop became visible at the most 3\u2032 G-tract (Fig. 2a , lanes 2-5 un3), indicating effective stabilization also of this template. Quantification of the stop sites indicated a similar degree of polymerase stalling induced by the compound in the three G4-forming sequences (Fig. 2b) .",

Selected competitor G4s were hTel, c-myc and c-kit2 G4s, which correspond to the G4-forming sequences of the human telomeric repeat, the promoter of the c-myc oncogene and c-kit protooncogene 30, 31 , and HIV-1 LTR-III G4, the HIV-1 G4 previously shown to be selectively bound with high affinity by c-exNDI 5, 19 . In each case, HIV-1 LTR-III G4s were preferred over HSV-1 G4s, data that confirm c-exNDI selectivity for HIV-1 G4s 19 ( Table 2) . C-myc G4 was also always preferred and c-kit2 G4 was preferred vs HSV-1 un2 and gp054a. In contrast, HSV-1 un2 and un3 G4s were preferred over hTel. Gp054a was generally less preferentially bound over all the other analysed sequences. The measured selectivity did not depend on the starting stability of the competing G4s: in fact, in 100 mM K + , preferred G4s such as LTR-III (T m 52.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C) and c-myc (T m > 90 \u00b0C) had T m values both lower and higher, respectively, than HSV-1 G4s (Table 1 ); in contrast, non-preferred G4s had similar T m values (hTel21 68.6 \u00b1 0.2, c-kit2 72.9 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b0C) ( Table 1) . C-exNDI displays potent anti-HSV-1 activity. Since our data indicate that even if HSV-1 G4s are not totally preferred, nonetheless they are preferred over telomeric G4s, the most abundant cellular G4 structures in infected cells, we tested the ability of c-exNDI to inhibit HSV-1. In plaque assay, the compound showed 50% inhibition of HSV-1 production (IC 50 ) at 18.3 \u00b1 1.4 nM (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, the compound concentration able to kill 50% of the cells, as measured by MTT assay, was 628.4 \u00b1 2.1 nM, resulting in a remarkable selectivity index (SI = 34.3 \u00b1 2.7) (Fig. 3a ). To confirm this data, a recombinant HSV-1 expressing GFP fused to the viral protein VP16 (HSV-1 [V41]) was used to infect cells; this mutant virus is characterized by normal replication kinetics and yields 32 . Analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with c-exNDI and acyclovir (ACV), the antiviral drug of choice for treatment of HSV-1 infections 33 , here used as the reference drug to which compare the anti-HSV-1 potency of c-exNDI. Both compounds were used at low/non cytotoxic concentration (i.e. 100 nM c-exNDI and 3 \u03bcM ACV) corresponding to 5 times their IC 50 values 34, 35 . Cells infected with HSV-1 [V41] and treated with c-exNDI or ACV at 24 h.p.i were monitored for their GFP fluorescence. C-exNDI (Fig. 3b ,c) induced an almost complete reduction of GFP fluorescence (8.6%, expressed as mean of GFP fluorescence), whereas 26% of cells remained fluorescent upon treatment with ACV (Fig. 3b,c) .",

In particular, genes corresponding to immediate-early (IE: ICP22, ICP47), early (E: UL30) and late (L: UL36) proteins were considered. At 4 h.p.i., no significant inhibition of viral mRNAs production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i. all mRNAs were reduced to a similar extent (28-45%) (Fig. 4a) . A similar trend has been reported for ACV 36 . To assess the main and temporally last viral step targeted by c-exNDI, we performed a time of addition (TOA) assay where the maximal low/mild-cytotoxic concentration of the compound was added at different times post-infection (corresponding to different viral cycle steps). The compound maintained its inhibitory activity when added up to 8 h.p.i (Fig. 4b) . This is the time when viral replication occurs; indeed, ACV, a known inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase 37 , showed a remarkably overlapping TOA profile. These data indicate that c-exNDI inhibits viral production mainly by targeting viral replication. Inhibition of viral DNA replication was further confirmed by qPCR analysis. At 4 h.p.i no reduction in viral DNA replication and production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i viral DNA was reduced of about 40% (Fig. S1 ), similarly to what observed with another G4-ligand targeting HSV-1 DNA 27 .",

Interestingly, even if a net preferentiality for HSV-1 G4s over some cellular G4s was not observed, nevertheless c-exNDI displayed potent anti-HSV-1 activity paralleled by mild/low toxicity at the doses necessary to achieve complete suppression of virus production (Fig. 3a) . We ascribe this behaviour to two main reasons: i) the massive presence of G4s during the HSV-1 viral cycle. By an antibody-based approach in cells we demonstrated that viral G4s form massively in the nucleus during viral Table 2 . Relative binding affinity, analyzed by MS competition assay for un2, un3, gp054a, hTel21, c-kit2 (kit), c-myc (myc) and HIV-1 LTR-III G4-folded oligonucleotides. replication 28 . During this step they likely control both viral replication itself and other key processes of the infection, with consequent dramatic effect when they are stabilized by c-exNDI. In fact, viral replication was here shown to be the step targeted by c-exNDI, which strongly points to the compound G4-based mechanism of action on the HSV-1 G4s. ii) The higher affinity of c-exNDI for HSV-1 G4s vs telomeric G4s. These are the most abundant cellular G4s in the infected cell: their lack of optimal recognition by the compound is likely the main reason for the observed low cellular toxicity at antiviral effective doses (Fig. 5) . Impairment of viral replication led to the decrease of viral genes in all phases of the viral life cycle. This effect is shared between c-exNDI and ACV 36 . We have previously shown that the general G4 ligand, BRACO-19, mainly decreased L viral genes 27 . This discrepancy may be due to the lower affinity of BRACO-19 for HSV-1 G4s and lower antiviral activity (IC 50 in the low micromolar range) 27 which would result in observable inhibition only of genes temporally more closely influenced by inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, in the case of c-exNDI and ACV, their potent effect on the HSV-1 genome is likely sensed at a more extended level. There is also the fascinating possibility that c-exNDI reacts with additional G4s, such as those in key regulatory IE and E genes; in fact, besides the extended G4 repeats in the terminal and inverted repeats 27 , less extended but stable G4s structures are also distributed throughout the HSV-1 genome and embedded in the promoter and coding sequences of fundamental genes 27 .",

Since the HSV-1 infection is a common illness associated to immunosuppression, the impact of our data extends to AIDS, cancer and transplanted patients. Circular Dichroism. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed using a Chirascan-Plus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a Peltier temperature controller using a quartz cell of 5 mm path length.

Thermal unfolding analyses were recorded from 230 to 320 nm over a temperature range of 20-90 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C/min). The reported spectrum of each sample represents the average of 2 scans and is baseline-corrected for buffer contribution. Observed ellipticities were converted to mean residue ellipticity (\u03b8) = deg \u00d7 cm 2 \u00d7 dmol \u22121 (mol ellip). T m values were calculated according to the Van't Hoff equation, applied for a two-state transition, assuming that the heat capacity of the folded and unfolded states are equal.",

(b) Vero cells were treated at the same concentrations of c-exNDI (0.7 nM-100 nM) used in the antiviral assay and cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. (c) Flow cytometry of HSV-1 [V41]-infected cells treated with c-exNDI and ACV. HSV-1 [V41]-infected cells were used as positive control and their GFP fluorescence set to 100%. C-exNDI (red curve) and ACV (orange curve)-treated infected cells were compared to HSV-1 [V41]infected cells (green curve) to monitor compound inhibition of GFP fluorescence. (d) Quantification of the mean of GFP fluorescence upon treatment of HSV-1 [V41]-infected cells with c-exNDI and ACV, observed in (b).",

Infected cells were treated with c-exNDI (100 nM); 4 or 24 h.p.i total RNA was isolated, retrotranscribed into cDNA and expression of specific genes was determined by RT-PCR. RQ are Relative Quantities. Each gene was analyzed in duplicate. In all data sets: n \u2265 2, mean \u00b1 s.d., Student's t-test, p \u2264 0.01. (b) Effect of c-exNDI on HSV-1 cycle steps evaluated by time of addition assay. C-exNDI was tested at 100 nM (dashed line/squares), acyclovir (ACV) was used as a reference drug and tested at 3 \u03bcM (solid line/ circles).
