Coronaviruses were detected in 141 samples (15.3%) from species of ducks, shorebirds and herons and from multiple sampling locations. Sequencing of selected positive samples found mainly gammacoronaviruses, but also some deltacoronaviruses. The detection rate of coronaviruses was improved by using multiple PCR assays, as no single assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples. Sequencing of the relatively conserved Orf1 PCR amplicons found that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses were similar to duck gammacoronaviruses around the world. Some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to Charadriiformes lineages, but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses. Australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses, but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available. Deltacoronavirus sequences from shorebirds formed a lineage with a deltacoronavirus from a ruddy turnstone detected in the United States. Given that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions, and Australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory Palearctic duck species, we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of Australia.",

Coronaviruses were distributed across multiple species and geographical locations, with an average coronavirus positive prevalence of 15.3%. In bird orders with over 50 individuals sampled, coronaviruses were most frequently detected in Anseriformes (26.7%) followed by Charadriiformes (13.3%). Gammacoronaviruses were found in 100% of sequenced samples from ducks, while duck deltacoronaviruses were much less common (in only one sample). Shorebirds were positive for gamma-CoV's most commonly (80% of sequenced samples), but delta-CoV's were also present in these species (20% of sequenced samples). Herons were positive for delta-CoV's exclusively; however, with the caveat that only 7 samples were included in this study. While the patterns of predominantly gammacoronaviruses in ducks and deltacoronaviruses in herons have been described in previous surveys 16, 19, 20, 23 , the detection of both gamma-and delta-CoV's in the same populations of Charadriiformes at the same time is unique to this study. DNA sequencing of 67 of the 141 PCR positive samples confirmed that the PCRs were in fact amplifying coronavirus cDNA, although it was evident that no single PCR assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples. The use of multiple PCR assays to screen wild bird samples increased the overall sensitivity for detecting coronaviruses. Compared to the 5\u2032 UTR PCR, nested and modified PCRs alone, the detection rate of coronaviruses 3 fold respectively when all PCRs were used together. Had only one assay been used in this study, a number of coronaviruses in individual species would not have been detected. For example, only the modified PCR detected delta-CoV's in the curlew sandpipers and the red-necked stints, while the nested PCR was able to detect more delta-CoV's in ruddy turnstones and pied herons. None of the PCRs described in this study detected the deltacoronavirus in the pooled duck sample. Amplicon sequencing from this sample found that the PCRs were preferentially amplifying the gammacoronavirus present. However next generation sequencing data from this sample (Vibin et al., 2018 (submitted)) found deltacoronavirus sequences were more abundant than those of the gammacoronavirus. Therefore the current pan-coronavirus PCRs may favour detection of gammacoronaviruses over deltacoronaviruses and this may explain why studies to date have found many more gammacoronaviruses in wild birds. It is possible that there are many more genetically diverse coronaviruses circulating in wild birds which are currently outside the detection abilities of the current published pancoronavirus PCRs, and it will be interesting to see how our understanding of coronavirus diversity improves as the use of non-targeted next generation sequencing techniques becomes more common.",

It is the most sequenced genomic region of coronaviruses from wild bird hosts, with many studies using PCRs targeting this region to detect avian coronaviruses 16, 18, 24, 26 . The fragment analysed in this study represents about 1% of the coronavirus genome, and therefore any interpretation of relationships in the phylogenetic tree should be made cautiously. With these caveats in mind, no temporal or spatial patterns in coronavirus sequences was observed in either the gamma-or deltacoronavirus phylogenetic analyses. However, some clustering by host species/order was observed, and this was strongest in the deltacoronaviruses, similar to the situation observed by Chu, et al. 16 in Hong Kong and Cambodia who observed similar host species lineages. There was a Charadriiformes delta-CoV lineage observed which was strongly supported by the bootstrap analysis. All seven Australian shorebird delta-CoV's from three different host species clustered with the single previously characterised shorebird delta-CoV from a ruddy turnstone sampled on the East Coast of the United States 21 . The one Australian duck deltacoronavirus belonged to a duck lineage of deltacoronaviruses, but itself was 18.6% different to its closest relative sequence from a Eurasian teal in Hong Kong 16 . Similarly, the Australian heron deltacoronaviruses were within the lineage containing other herons but were genetically different to heron sequences seen elsewhere.",

However some Charadriiform gammacoronaviruses were highly similar in nucleotide sequence to gammacoronaviruses from ducks, e.g. the curlew sandpiper gammacoronaviruses contained a single nucleotide difference to mallard gammacoronavirus sequences identified in Sweden 25 . Even within the Charadriiformes lineages, the degree of genetic difference to duck sequences was much less than that seen in the deltacoronavirus phylogeny. The phylogeny based on the amino acid sequence of the gammacoronaviruses separated the majority of the duck and Charadriiform gammacoronaviruses into separate branches, however both the curlew sandpiper gammacoronaviruses and a single ruddy turnstone gamma-CoV were identical in amino acid homology to duck Australian duck gamma-CoV's as well as duck gamma-CoV's identified in other investigations 16, 18, 20, 25, 27 . These results again suggest that migratory Charadriiformes may share gammacoronaviruses with other avian species 16, 18 and are therefore important vectors and reservoir of coronaviruses. Hughes, et al. 23 and Chu, et al. 16 identified similar gammacoronavirus sequences between Charadriiformes and Anseriformes, while Lima, et al. 18 found similar gammacoronaviruses in Charadriiformes and Gruiformes in Madagascar. Interestingly, Hughes, et al. 23 identified their similar sequences by a PCR targeting the 3\u2032 UTR, while Lima, et al. 18 identified similar sequences with the same nested PCR used in this investigation 16 .",

Australian duck species rarely come into direct contact with Palearctic waterfowl 28 . Some degree of geographical gammacoronavirus lineage formation might therefore have been expected, if this was the only means of transmission of duck gamma-CoV's, due to the high rate of mutation and recombination observed in other avian gamma-CoV's 29, 30 . However, such isolation was not observed, which suggests that movement of coronaviruses between these populations of ducks occurs frequently. Given that millions of Charadriiformes migrate to Australia to spend their non-breeding season in Australia 31 , Australian ducks would be much more likely to come into direct contact with Palearctic Charadriiformes than Anseriformes. It is also likely that there are many opportunities for individuals within the migrating shorebird populations to acquire and transmit coronaviruses to/from ducks as they move north-south, as coronaviruses are prevalent in both Charadriiformes and Anseriformes along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway 16,20,32 and these species forage and breed in similar habitats 33 .",

The nested PCR used primers Chu-RdRp-N2-F (5\u2032-GGT TGG GAC TAT CCT AAG TGT GA-3\u2032) and Chu-RdRp-N2-R (5\u2032-CCA TCA TCA GAT AGA ATC ATC AT-3\u2032) and amplified a 440 bp product within the first PCR. The PCR reaction mixture was made with 1 \u00b5l of the first PCR reaction, 1 \u00d7 AmpliTaq Gold 360 PCR Mix, 0.5 \u00b5M of each primer, 3 mM MgCl 2 and RNase free water in a total volume of 10 \u00b5l. PCR reactions were conducted in a thermal cycler at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 48 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 72 \u00b0C for 50 sec followed by a final step of 72 \u00b0C for 3 min. 5 \u00b5l of each PCR was then run on a 1.6% agarose gel. A sample was declared positive if a band of the expected size was seen on the gel from either PCR.",

The aligned region belonged to the Orf1/Polymerase gene between nucleotides 14203 to 14761 of the reference avian infectious bronchitis virus sequence (Genbank accession: NC_001451.1). Absence of evidence of recombination was confirmed using the Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD) method 40 of the HyPhy package hosted on the DataMonkey webserver 41 . Codon specific selection pressure was analysed using the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL), internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and random effects likelihood (REL) methods available on the DataMonkey server as previously described 42 . All analyses were performed on the optimum model as determined by the model selection algorithm of the server, and using Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic trees. A p-value of 0.05 or Bayes factor of 100 were selected for the selection pressure analyses, which indicated evidence for negative selection and no evidence of positive selection (data not shown). To understand the relationship between the coronavirus sequences identified in this study and those of other studies, a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed in MEGA 7. The gammacoronavirus phylogenetic tree was created from 277 nt of sequence using the Tamura-Nei model with 5 discrete gamma distribution categories 43 . The deltacoronavirus phylogenetic tree was created from 311 nt of sequence using the Tamura 3 parameter model 44 with 5 discrete gamma distribution categories with invariant sites. An amino acid maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed on the gammacoronavirus sequence (92 amino acids) using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model with 5 discrete gamma distribution categories and 500 bootstrap replicates. All models were determined to be the best fitting models to the sequence data by MEGA 7. Statistical and data analysis. A sample was considered positive for coronavirus if it was positive in at least one of the PCR assays.

Most samples were taken from birds within avian families Anatidae (Anatinae and Tadorninae; Order Anseriformes -146 samples), Scolopacidae (Order Charadriiformes -728 samples), Procellariidae (Order Procellariiformes -30 samples) and Ardeidae (Order Pelecaniformes -7 samples). Birds were sampled between April 2016 and January 2017 at multiple locations in south eastern Australia and the Northern Territory. Birds were caught either by hand, cannon netting or baited walk-in traps 34 . Some duck samples were obtained from hunter-killed animals. All samples were taken from single individuals and consisted of a combined cloacal and oropharyngeal swab, except for one sample (Pacific Black Duck CoV-G0001-2016/12/21-LC/VIC), which was a pool of faeces collected from a group of 6 juvenile Pacific black ducks trapped together. No birds sampled as part of the influenza surveillance were showing any clinical signs of disease. Capture and sampling of birds were carried out in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations and under animal ethics permits B37-2013 and B43-2016 issued by Deakin University Animal Ethics Committee.",
