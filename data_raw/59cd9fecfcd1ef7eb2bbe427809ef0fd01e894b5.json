The 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV RNA genome was mapped structurally into ABC (a cloverleaf-like), D (a stem-loop), and E (pseudoknot) domains. The BaMV replicase complex that was isolated from the infected plants was able to recognize the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro. Results: To investigate whether the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA is also compatible with BaMV replicase in vivo, we constructed chimera mutants using a BaMV backbone containing the PVX 3\u2032 UTR, which was inserted in or used to replace the various domains in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV. None of the mutants, except for the mutant with the PVX 3\u2032 UTR inserted upstream of the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR, exhibited a detectable accumulation of viral RNA in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The in vitro BaMV RdRp replication assay demonstrated that the RNA products were generated by the short RNA transcripts, which were derived from the chimera mutants to various extents. Furthermore, the V max /K M of the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR (rABCDE) was approximately three fold higher than rABCP, rP, and rDE in minus-strand RNA synthesis. These mutants failed to accumulate viral products in protoplasts and plants, but were adequately replicated in vitro.",

The tertiary structure, which comprises 3 stem-loops constitutes the ABC domain (a cloverleaf-like structure), the D domain, and the E domain (a pseudoknot structure) ( Figure 1 ) [14, 17] . The ABC domain functions in both minus-strand RNA synthesis and viral long-distance movement [15] . The D domain contains the potexviral conserved sequence at the apical loop, which is required for efficient viral RNA replication, [16] and the polyadenylation signal at the internal loop [18] .

However, the two detectable mutants were the insertion mutants BaMV-S/PABCDE (96%) and BaMV-S/ABCDEP (6%) at 48 h post inoculation ( Figure 2 ). Similar results were observed in plants for all the replacement mutants that were inoculated with the same set of full-length RNA transcripts. Although BaMV-S/ABCDEP could be detected in protoplasts for approximately 6%, it failed to be detected in plants. The only one mutant survived in plants is BaMV-S/PABCDE. The progeny virus was produced; however, symptom development and systemic movement were delayed by 1 d in plants compared with those inoculated with BaMV-S. The BaMV-S/PABCDE RNA was isolated from plant tissue and sequenced to confirm that no undesired mutations were introduced.",

The result showed that the RNA decay profile of these chimeras was similar to that of BaMV ( Figure 3A ), and suggested that the stability may not be the main cause of the chimeras failed to accumulate in vivo. This result was supported by in vitro translation assay that all constructs could translate the replicase at similar levels ( Figure 3B ). Therefore, we concluded that the defect of the most chimeras in plant cells is not due to their stability or translatability.",

Conversely, the rP that represents the heterologous PVX 3\u2032 UTR displayed an approximate RNA accumulation of 60%. The addition of the homologous BaMV ABC domains to the 5\u2032 end of the PVX 3\u2032 UTR (rABCP) resulted in an increase in the wild-type level ( Figure 4A ), indicating that the ABC domain plays a vital role in BaMV RNA replication. Similarly, rABC without the RdRp binding domain (D and E) [6] could only have 17% template activity, with the addition of the PVX 3\u2032 UTR could exhibit almost wild-type template activity ( Figure 4B ). The mutants with the ABC domain replaced by the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA, such as rPDE and rPE, exhibited 39% and 68% RNA accumulation, respectively. These results indicate that the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA could functionally complement the D and E domains of BaMV RNA in vitro. These results can be also linked to the colinearity of the helicase-like and RdRp domains of BaMV that bind to the ABC and DE domains, respectively [6, 15] . However, for rABCDP and rABCPE, only 51% and 38% RNA accumulation were achieved, respectively (Figure 4 ), which implies that these functional homologous regions (DE vs. P) affect each other when they are fused in tandem. Although the transcript rPABCDE contains DE and P, the linearity of ABC and DE is remained to fit the continuity of helicase-like and RdRp domains. Whereas mutant rABCDEP with DE and P homologous domains connected to each other could have the interference of the RdRp binding that resulted in only 56% template activity ( Figure 4B ).",

To ensure that effective amounts of RNA were used to induce detectable levels of viral RNA replication in plants, the plants were transfected directly with up to 20 \u03bcg of BaMV-S/ABCP RNA or with lysates prepared from protoplasts that were transfected with the same amounts of RNA. However, no viral products were detected using Western and Northern blotting analyses. A possible explanation for this result is that the suboptimal kinetics did not allow BaMV-S/ABCP to pass over the RNA threshold and effectively initiate the virus life cycle in the host cell. Therefore, the kinetic parameters between the replicase complex and several mutant RNA templates were analyzed to determine the possible roles of the various 3\u2032 UTR domains in BaMV RNA replication. Chimera rABCP has slower replication rate than that of wild-type Transcripts of rABCDE, rABCP, rDE, and rP were studied to focus on the ABC and DE domains. A Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic graph, which was based on the determined initial velocity and substrate concentration ( Figure 5) , was transformed into a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The K M values for rABCDE, rABCP, rP, and rDE were calculated as 302, 295, 533, and 209 nM, respectively ( Table 1 ). The similar K M values of rABCDE and rABCP imply that they exhibit comparable replicase complex-binding efficiencies. However, rABCDE displayed a V max /K M that was a threefold higher than that of rABCP, which indicates that rABCP replicated at a slower rate than rABCDE. Conversely, compared to rP (K M =533 nM), the addition of the BaMV ABC domain in rABCP (K M =295 nM) enhanced the interaction between the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX and the BaMV replicase complex. The mutant rDE transcript exhibited a stronger affinity (K M =209 nM) but a slower initiation rate that cause a lower V max /K M than rABCDE in the interaction with the BaMV replicase complex.",

The chimera BaMV-S/ABCP failed to accumulate any viral products in protoplasts; however, the rABCP transcript exhibited a wild-type level of RNA synthesis in the in vitro replication assay (Figures 2 and 4) . The results of the kinetic study demonstrated that the V max /K M of rABCP was a three-fold lower than that of rABCDE. The RNA replication rate of this mutant in a cell may be too slow to compete out with the rate of viral RNA removal by the scavenging system such as the siRNA silencing pathway [22] . The catalytic constant in viral RNA synthesis was critical to establish the successful viral infection that the higher catalytic in transcription the higher the chances to survive in hosts [23, 24] . Alternatively, minus-strand RNA synthesis may be normally executed in vivo as that shown in the in vitro replication assay, however, the progeny plus-strand RNA derived from these newly synthesized minus-strand templates contains the aberrant sequences (the chimera) in the 3\u2032 UTR. These abnormal chimeric 3\u2032 UTRs may cause the failure in post-transcription RNA maturation (such as polyadenylation) and result in immature progeny RNAs.",

            "text": "Compared to rABCP (93%; Figure 4B ), the reduction of RNA replication with rABCDP (51%) and rABCPE (38%) in an in vitro BaMV RNA replication assay may be attributed to the redundant potexviral-conserved hexamer motifs that are found in D domain of BaMV RNA and the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA. An alternative hypothesis is that the alteration of the distance between the ABC domain and the poly(A) region, which was demonstrated to be the initiation site of minus-strand RNA replication [19] , may hinder the progression of RNA replication, and that rABCP and rABCDE may fold into a similar conformation. Footprinting analysis demonstrated that domains D and E are the target sites for the polymerase domain of BaMV ORF1 [6] . Therefore, the space between domain D and E is critical for the interaction between the RNA template and the RdRp complex. The differences between the kinetic parameters of rABCP (K M =295 nM) and rP (K M =533 nM) imply that the addition of the BaMV ABC domain enhanced the interaction between the BaMV RdRp complex and the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX. This enhancement may be resulting from the binding of the ABC domain in the 3\u2032 UTR with the helicase-like domain of the replicase encoded by BaMV [15] . The helicase-like domain in BMV played a role in RNA recruitment [36] that the disrupting or missing the ABC (the helicase binding region in BaMV) domain in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV may also be failure in template recruitment. The rDE transcript exhibited a higher affinity with the replicase complex, but failed to replicate in protoplasts. The V max /K M of rDE was calculated as 2.5-fold lower than that of rABCDE. A stronger binding may impede the movement of the enzyme complex on the RNA template, which may lead to an RNA replication rate too slow to overcome the threshold required to establish a successful infection.",
