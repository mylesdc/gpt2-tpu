            "text": "Background: Characterization of respiratory phenotypes can enhance complex trait and genomic studies involving allergic/autoimmune and infectious diseases. Many aspects of respiration can be measured using devices known as plethysmographs that can measure thoracic movement. One such approach (the Buxco platform) performs unrestrained whole body plethysmography on mice which infers thoracic movements from pressure differences from the act of inhalation and exhalation. While proprietary software is available to perform basic statistical analysis as part of machine's bundled software, it is desirable to be able to incorporate these analyses into high-throughput pipelines and integrate them with other data types, as well as leverage the wealth of analytic and visualization approaches provided by the R statistical computing environment. Results: This manuscript describes the plethy package which is an R/Bioconductor framework for pre-processing and analysis of plethysmography data with emphasis on larger scale longitudinal experiments. The plethy package was designed to facilitate quality control and exploratory data analysis. We provide a demonstration of the features of plethy using a dataset assessing the respiratory effects over time of SARS and Influenza infection in mice.",

Although such devices can be applied clinically [1] , plethysmographs designed for small animals provides an effective means to study phenotypes that can be expensive or impossible to carry out in humans. There are several variants of plethysmographs which differ in whether the animal is wholly contained within the chamber and whether they are restrained during the measurements [2] .

This dataset is available as an R package at https://github.com/dbottomly/plethyData. Demonstration of these features and reproduction of the tables and figures is shown in Additional file 1 and Additional file 4. As is described in the 'Parsing' section of Additional file 1, the plethysmography files we work with are large and structured. Previously sections of these files would be loaded and manipulated in Excel by investigators, a process which was both tedious and error prone. The plethy package simplifies this process and enables efficient exploration and analysis of the data with only a handful of R functions. Assuming the data has been loaded into a database and a BuxcoDB object exists, we can first perform QA/QC of the data followed by exploratory data analysis and model fitting. ",

For example, the expectation is that the Flu, SARS and mock infected animals were first allowed an acclimation period of 30 minutes in the chamber followed by 5 minutes of experimental readings. As shown in Additional file 1, these data can be labeled with their inferred run type (acclimation or experimental) and these labels can then be checked for similarity to the experimental design. If deviations are detected, the data can be re-labeled, keeping the old labels for provenance. The plethy package comes with procedures to provide basic checks of the measurement timestamps. One such check is performed internally while parsing and loading the data. This check emits a warning if observed experimental time intervals are greater than a specified tolerance. Similarly, the exact timepoint of an experiment can be computed from the measurement timestamps which are captured in the SQLite database. This enables automatic checking of the labeled experimental timepoint. In the case of the SARS, Flu and mock data, no such anomalies exist but we provide a simulated dataset where they do in the 'Quality Control' section in Additional file 1. These data can then be visualized using several built in methods as well as other visualization functionality in R.",

Also as mentioned above, retrieveData can provide the user with a data.frame and similarly data can also be returned in matrix form using the retrieveMatrix method. Importantly, either data.frames or matrices can serve as the input to almost all modelling functions in R. For example, we may be interested in assessing the effect of time and infection status on Penh values. As shown in Figures 1 and 2 , the Penh response over time is nonlinear showing a peak around Day 7 for Flu and 3 for SARS followed by a decline to roughly the level shown by the mock infected animals. An initial model for this might involve infection status and polynomial terms for time. Any such model should also account for the presence of many technical measurements for each sample.",

If more samples were accrued, we may also be interested in predicting Flu, SARS and Mock status given measurements from mutliple plethysmography outputs.

            "text": "Our software provides a convenient framework for storage and retrieval of whole body plethysmography data in R. Currently we support import of data from the FinePointe software of Buxco, however the basic framework is amendable to data produced from other vendors. As the software is open source, such support can be requested via the Bioconductor mailing list or contributed via the github site (https://github.com/dbottomly/plethy) for the project. R in conjunction with SQLite allows efficient exploration and summarization of the data. Future releases of plethy will include additional built-in plotting and summarization tools. ",
