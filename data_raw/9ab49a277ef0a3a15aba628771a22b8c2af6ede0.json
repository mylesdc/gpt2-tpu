            "text": "RNA recombination is one of the driving forces of genetic variability in (+)-strand RNA viruses. Various types of RNA-RNA crossovers were described including crosses between the same or different viral RNAs or between viral and cellular RNAs. Likewise, a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to support RNA recombination, such as replicative events (based on internal or end-to-end replicase switchings) along with non-replicative joining among RNA fragments of viral and/or cellular origin. Such mechanisms as RNA decay or RNA interference are responsible for RNA fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions which are likely accountable for ligation of RNA fragments. Numerous host factors were found to affect the profiles of viral RNA recombinants and significant differences in recombination frequency were observed among various RNA viruses. Comparative analyses of viral sequences allowed for the development of evolutionary models in order to explain adaptive phenotypic changes and co-evolving sites. Many questions remain to be answered by forthcoming RNA recombination research. (1) How various factors modulate the ability of viral replicase to switch templates, (2) What is the intracellular location of RNA-RNA template switchings, (3) Mechanisms and factors responsible for non-replicative RNA recombination, (4) Mechanisms of integration of RNA viral sequences with cellular genomic DNA, and (5) What is the role of RNA splicing and ribozyme activity. From an evolutionary stand point, it is not known how RNA viruses parasitize new host species via recombination, nor is it obvious what the contribution of RNA recombination is among other RNA modification pathways. We do not understand why the frequency of RNA recombination varies so much among RNA viruses and the status of RNA recombination as a form of sex is not well documented.",

RNA viruses demonstrate a large level of variability in their genetic information, due to either mutations, RNA-RNA crossovers (RNA recombination), or reassortment. RNA recombination was demonstrated for many RNA virus species, whether under natural or experimental conditions. Similar to genetic recombination in DNA-based organisms, viral RNA recombination is defined as the process of swapping RNA fragments among RNA molecules. If crossovers occur amongst the same RNA templates in a homologous fashion, the exchanges are functionally equivalent to DNA meiotic crossing-over. In some viruses, the frequency of homologous crossing-over is very high and practically every replicated viral RNA molecule can be considered as chimerical in nature, as we have demonstrated for brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs (Urbanowicz et al., 2005) .",

Since this issue of Frontiers concerns plant pathology, most of the material discusses RNA recombination in plant viruses.

Among the factors known to promote replicase to switch are sequence homologies between recombination substrates along with secondary structures at the crossover sites, as demonstrated with the BMV and other systems (Figlerowicz and Bujarski, 1998; Nagy et al., 1999b) . Also, the transcriptional activity seems to promote template switching. For instance, an efficient recombination hot spot has been mapped within the intercistronic region of BMV RNA3, the site carrying the promoter of transcription of subgenomic RNA4 (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2004) . It is unknown what exactly facilitates crossovers at such sites. Possibilities include a snatching process of already bound RdRp complex to the promoter site, the premature termination of RNA synthesis and the replicase detachmentreattachment, or the effect of other bound viral and/or host factors (Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2011) . These mechanisms may depend upon the type of template-switching process (whether the crosses occur internally or near the ends of the RNA templates) and on the involvement of crossover sequences in other processes, e.g., as a promoter of RNA replication or transcription.",

Some data indicate that switches depend upon sequence composition, with the AU-rich regions promoting the RdRp detachment (Nagy et al., 1999a) and upon secondary structures (Galetto et al., 2006) , along with protein or RNA binding activity. Switching may also depend upon the processivity (a measure of the average number of nucleotides copied per template association-disassociation cycle) features of the RdRp enzyme (Breyer and Matthews, 2001) . A mandatory replicase breaking site is the end of any RNA template. End-to-end switching has been reported based upon in vitro results with RdRp enzymes from Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), BMV, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) (Kim and Kao, 2001) .

One of the best characterized non-replicative processes is demonstrated in the poliovirus where viable viruses were rescued in cells co-transfected with different pairs of viral RNA fragments (Gmyl et al., 1999) . It is likely the recombinants may have resulted from transesterification reactions with the end structures similar to known ribozymes via intermediary formation of 2 ,3 -cyclic phosphate. Indeed, in vitro data show that the transesterification reactions in the bacteriophage Qbeta RNA are guided by secondary structures that direct the attack of a 3 hydroxyl onto the phosphodiester bonds (Chetverin et al., 1997) . Later observations revealed enormous variability of the poliovirus genome and some variants may have been introduced by genetic errors due to non-replicative mechanisms (Agol, 2006) . More recent results with partially-complementary RNA-oligonucleotides demonstrated the spontaneous formation of novel RNA molecules via 3 ,5 -phosphodiester bonds (Lutay et al., 2007) .

(2005) have shown a high yield of primer-extension recombination with poliovirus replicase, but a low yield with Qbeta replicase. Thus, RNA recombination by poliovirus vs. Qbeta RdRps must be mechanistically different. Although both utilize transesterification reactions, the precise molecular bases for RNA swappings used by each of these enzymes are likely dissimilar reflecting different biochemical adaptations to the needs of individual viruses. It would be interesting to confirm experimentally the proposed transesterification models.",

While the involvement of viral RdRp proteins has been studied extensively, knowledge of the functions host components play is limited (Nagy and Pogany, 2011) . One study was done with a model system of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) that can recombine in yeast cells. The authors screened a yeast knockout library to identify over thirty different host genes suppressing or accelerating the TBSV RNA recombination (Serviene et al., 2005; Nagy, 2011) . An interesting example is the gene PMR1 which encodes an ion pump (Pmr1p) controlling the Mn2+ concentration which may consequently affect the ability of TBSV replicase to change RNA binding/template switching events. Also stress signals, e.g., salt stress, affect viral recombination indirectly, by changing the concentration of recombination-essential proteins. Future studies are required to understand the interrelated network of cellular factors that define the final outcome of TBSV RNA recombinants, not only in model yeast cells, but also in natural TBSV plant hosts. Moreover, these studies are limited to only one specific TBSV RNA experimental recombination system, and it is unclear if other RNA recombination events within the TBSV RNA follow similar mechanistic pathways.",

The switching properties likely depend on the co-recruited host factors. In BMV, a variety of host factors were found to be employed by the replicase complex (Noueiry and Ahlquist, 2003) . Many of these factors facilitate the complex assembly, but some regulate viral gene expression or recruitment of BMV RNAs to the membrane replication factories. Yet, other factors modify lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane which activates the replication complex. Many of these factors can potentially affect the co-recruitment of RNA recombination substrates and/or BMV replicase switching properties during recombination. BMV RNA recombination was reported to occur in yeast cells (Garcia-Ruiz and Ahlquist, 2006) , but a systematic identification of host factors participating in BMV RNA recombination remains to be done. It will be interesting to find out whether these factors parallel those in the above tombusvirus recombination system. This data will broaden our knowledge about host pathways enabling RNA viruses to recombine their genetic information. As such, it will contribute to predictions made on the stability of the RNA viral genome in various hosts.",

Comparison among three plant RNA virus replication systems (TBSV, BMV, and dianthoviruses) reveals general patterns within the stepwise process of viral replicase complex assembly which requires concerted involvement of protein-protein, RNA-protein, and protein-lipid interactions (Mine and Okuno, 2012) . However, each of these three plant virus systems recruits its own array of specific host factors. This suggests that each RNA virus has significantly unique ways of adapting to the cellular environment in order to assemble a functional RNA replication complex. This further suggests specific requirements are needed for RNA recombination in each individual RNA virus and therefore the recombination characteristics may significantly differ with each other among RNA viruses. Crystal structure studies help to reveal the complex and individual nature of viral replicases. Examples being the structure of Q{beta} phage polymerase, determined by Takeshita and Tomita (2010) , or the analysis of the crystal structure of tomato mosaic virus helicase as a component of the viral replicase complex (Nishikiori et al., 2012) .",

It occurs at the presence yet also in the absence of an active viral RdRp enzyme, implying that the mechanisms must be different from replicative template switching events (Becher and Tautz, 2011) . The case of BVDV recombination has practical implications because the recombinant virus is lethal to its host. Normally, the virus is persistent, limiting the efficiency of RNA replication due to the dependency of a viral protease on limiting amounts of a cellular cofactor. In general, the uptake of a variety of cellular protein coding sequences at various positions in the pestiviral genomes has been reported, demonstrating that pestiviruses can gain access to the RNA pool of their hosts via RNA recombination. The example of BVDV shows us not only that recombination events with cellular RNAs cannot be excluded for other viruses, but also that the recombinant RNAs can be retro-transcribed and occasionally integrated into the host genome. The exact molecular mechanisms of the crossover events with cellular RNAs remain to be elucidated, as well as what factors target the crossover sites both to viral and to cellular RNAs.",

By testing eight known endoribonucleases, the authors have shown that mutations in the components of RNase MRP debilitated the production of endoribonucleolytically cleaved TBSV RNA in yeast. Also, by knocking down the RNase NME1 or silencing the Xrn4p exoribonuclease in Nicotiana benthamiana, the production of cleaved TBSV RNAs was debilitated, but recombination increased, suggesting the role of RNA intermediates in recombination (Jaag and Nagy, 2009 ). Similar effects promoting RNA recombination were observed in yeast for Xrn1p exoribonuclease (Serviene et al., 2005) . It is noteworthy that deletions of the host Met22p/Hal2p bisphosphate-3 -nucleotidase (a known inhibitor of the Xmn1p ribonuclease) or the inhibition of this nucleotidase with LiCl or NaCl, also increased the frequency of TBSV RNA recombination in yeast (Jaag and Nagy, 2010) .

The stochastic processes contribute to the beginning of viral emergence in a new host species, followed by the adaptation phase.

Inaccuracies of viral RNA replication, damage from environmental factors, and attacks by RNA-modifying enzymes, all can contribute to RNA genome corruption and thus generate a question of how RNA viruses maintain their genetic integrity (Barr and Fearns, 2010) . It seems that viral RdRps are sufficiently flexible to accommodate alternative initiation mechanisms, enabling terminal repair, terminal transferase activity, and recombinational crosses in the case of damaged key terminal sequences. Among a variety of mechanisms to protect RNA viral genome integrity, recombination allows for exchange of sequences between RNA templates, protecting not only their entire genome, but also their vulnerable termini. A typical example of efficient terminal crossover exchanges is seen within the 3 noncoding region of BMV RNAs (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986 ). The differences in replicase architecture might affect the predilection of a particular virus for RNA recombination. The molecular aspects of the theory on \"adaptable\" viral RdRps have not been elucidated and structural studies will contribute to the answers.",

The efficient recovery of recombinants in mixed infections could be achieved by using temperature sensitive mutants, a long-term method used for animal RNA viruses (Hirst, 1962; Pringle, 1970) . In whole plants, an important problem is that most recombinants are not competitive with the parental types and therefore disappear. One way to increase recombination rate is by using viral mutants bearing sequence modifications at their UTRs, which decreases the replication abilities of parental molecules, as was used to detect the BMV recombinants (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986) . Another approach utilizes viral RNAs bearing silent markers or via mixed infections with two low-competing viral strains (e.g., as the used by us mixed infection with both type and Fescue strains of BMV). Other plant virus recombination systems employ mixtures of two parental RNAs with one component carrying a deleterious mutation, e.g., satellite and genomic RNAs of TCV (Zhang et al., 1991) , or defective interfering and genomic RNAs of TBSV, Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) (White and Morris, 1995) , and Potato virus X (PVX) (Draghici and Varrelmann, 2010) . All these types of recombination systems can be used in cell-free extracts (utilizing viral RdRp preparations), in single-cell (protoplast) hosts, in whole plant hosts, and even in yeast. Some of the systems make use of transient expression vectors by agro-infiltrating plant leaves (Kwon and Rao, 2012) .",

The main analytical effort in the recombination experiments is to identify RNA recombination products and to map the location of cross sites. Usually, viral RNAs are extracted and amplified by RT-PCR and the resulting cDNA products are cloned followed by sequencing and/or restriction digestion of a large number of clones. This way the crossovers are detected and mapped within the sequence markers, providing information about both frequency and distribution of recombination events. Proper controls are required to guard against RT-PCR generated recombinants.",

By understanding the factors and the mechanisms that affect recombination, one can ultimately develop better means for controlling RNA virus infections. In this review I have described the current status of RNA virus recombination research and its future directions. I have also noted its progress over the last several years emphasizing on some future research venues. Evidently, there is still much to be learned about the mechanistic details of RNA recombination. For example, it is not yet clear how various factors modulate the ability of viral replicase to switch templates, such as the role of RNA template structures, the molecular and structural features of replicase proteins, or the functions of other viral and host factors during cross-over events. Also, the intracellular location of the RNA-RNA template switching has not been confirmed. Besides copy-choice, RNA viruses can recombine with non-replicative RNAs. It is not exactly known what mechanism is responsible for ligation of viral RNA fragments, or where inside the cell this process occurs. RNA viruses were found to recombine with cellular RNAs, but again where in the cell and what factors enable such events, is not well known. And the opposite, the exact steps and the molecular mechanisms of the RNA viral sequence integration with the cellular DNA have not been untangled. Amongst other questions, not much is known about how splicing or active ribozymes can contribute to the RNA virus recombination (Edgell et al., 2011) .",

Because of this and since recombination rates follow the patterns of RNA genome organization, Simon-Loriere and Holmes (2011) postulate that RNA recombination is a by-product of viral genome arrangement acting on selected aspects of the virus life cycle. Thus, according to the authors, RNA recombination does not seem to function as an obligatory form of sex in RNA viruses. Yet further studies are required, especially since Muller's ratchet effects were observed in RNA viruses (Turner, 2003) and the chimeric nature of viral RNAs due to frequent homologous RNA swaps was determined, e.g., in BMV (Urbanowicz et al., 2005) .",
