These multiple types of links are usually represented by a multiplex network in which each layer has a different topology. In real-world networks, however, not all nodes are present on every layer. To generate a more realistic scenario, we use a generalized multiplex network and assume that only a fraction q of the nodes are shared by the layers. We develop a theoretical framework for a branching process to describe the spread of an epidemic on these partially overlapped multiplex networks. This allows us to obtain the fraction of infected individuals as a function of the effective probability that the disease will be transmitted T. We also theoretically determine the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the fraction qw0 of shared nodes in a system composed of two layers. We find that in the limit of q?0 the threshold is dominated by the layer with the smaller isolated threshold. Although a system of two completely isolated networks is nearly indistinguishable from a system of two networks that share just a few nodes, we find that the presence of these few shared nodes causes the epidemic threshold of the isolated network with the lower propagating capacity to change discontinuously and to acquire the threshold of the other network.",

            "text": "Although the study of isolated networks allows us to understand how network topology affects network activity [1] , most real-world networks are not isolated, instead they interact with other networks. In recent years, many researchers have studied how interconnections between networks produce phenomena that are absent in isolated networks [2] . A system composed of interconnected networks, often called a network of networks [3] [4] [5] [6] , retains connectivity links within each individual network but adds dependency links that connect each network to other networks in the system. This interdependency is the cause of many realworld multiple network phenomena, such as failure cascades [7] , avalanches [8] , and traffic overloads [9] . Very recently physicists have begun to consider a particular class of network of networks in which the nodes have multiple types of links across different layers [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . These so-called multiplex networks were introduced in the social sciences several years ago [17] and provide a new way to advance the study of network complexity. They enable us to determine how the interplay between layers affects the dynamic processes running through them. This multiplex network approach has proven to be a successful tool in modeling a number of real-world systems, e.g., the European air transport system [18, 19] and the global cargo ship network [20] .",

            "text": "The study of propagation processes in multiplex networks is a rapidly evolving research area. In particular, because of the urgent need for control strategies, the study of the propagation of disease epidemics has been the focus of much recent work. One of the most successful models used to describe the propagation of recurrent diseases is the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Research using the SIS model on multiplex networks [21] [22] [23] has found that the dynamics of the disease across a multiplex system is characterized by a critical point that is lower than the critical point of each isolated layer. Very recently Cozzo et al. [24] studied the SIS model in a multiplex network using a contact-contagion formulation with a rate of infection within each layer and a rate of infection between layers. They found that the critical point of the total system is always dominated by one of the layers. Although the SIS model can describe the propagation dynamics for recurrent diseases in which individuals are constantly being reinfected, there are many diseases in which ill individuals either die or after recovery become immune to future infections. For this class of disease, the favorite approach to describing the spreading process is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [25] [26] [27] . At present there are only a few instances in which the SIR model has been applied to a network of networks. Dickison et al. [28] use the SIR model to numerically explore two interacting networks in order to determine the probabilities that the disease will spread within each individual network and between the networks of the system. Marceau et al. [29] developed an analytical approach that captures the dynamic interaction between two different SIR propagations over a multiplex network. Yagan et al. [30] studied the SIR model in a multiplex network with two different information layers, a virtual layer and a physical layer, each with different propagation speeds. They found that, even when the disease does not propagate in a particular layer, an epidemic can occur in the conjoint virtual-physical network.",

To allow for this significant constraint, we use a partially overlapped multiplex network in which only a fraction of individuals are present in all layers. Our goal is to study how this overlapping fraction affects the spreading of such nonrecurrent diseases as influenza, the H5N5 flu or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [31] . We use the SIR model over a partially overlapped multiplex network. In the SIR model each individual of the population can be in one of three different states: susceptible, infected, or recovered. Infected individuals transmit the disease to its susceptible neighbors with a probability b and recover after a fixed time t r . The spreading process stops when all the infected individuals are recovered. The dynamic of the epidemic is controlled by the transmissibility TP tr n~0 b(1{b) n{1~1 {(1{b) tr , which is a measure of disease virulence, i.e., the effective probability that the disease will be transmitted across any given link. As in the SIR model, an individual cannot be reinfected, the disease spreads through branches of infection that have a tree-like structure, and thus can be described using a generating function formalism [32, 33] that holds in the thermodynamic limit.",

            "text": "We first examine some of the concepts of the generating function formalism for an isolated network, and we then extend this formalism to the partially overlapped multiplex network. In the generating function framework, the relevant magnitude that provides information about the process is the probability f that a branch of infection can extend throughout the network [34, 35] . When a branch of infection reaches a node of connectivity k across one of its links, the branch can only expand through its remaining k{1 connections. Thus the probability that a node of connectivity k belongs to a branch of infection is proportional to k\u00bd1{(1{Tf ) k{1 , since the probability to reach a node through a link is proportional to its connectivity. Thus f verifies the selfconsistent equation f~1{G 1 (1{Tf ) in isolated networks, where G 1 (h)~P k kP(k)=SkT h k{1 is the generating function of the underlying branching process [33] , P(k) is the degree distribution, and SkT is the average degree of the network. In the steady state of the epidemics, the branches of infection form a single cluster of recovered individuals made up of nodes that were infected by some of its connections. Thus the fraction of nodes in the cluster of infection of an isolated network is given by R~1{G 0 (1{Tf ), where G 0 (h)~P k P(k)h k is the generating function of the degree distribution. Within this formalism we find that the self-consistent equation has a nontrivial solution above the critical transmissibility T c~1 =(k{1), where k~Sk 2 T=SkT is the branching factor and Sk 2 T is the second moment of P(k). Since k can be used to measure the connectivity dispersion of the network, we find that the critical threshold is very small for heterogeneous networks. At this critical threshold, the fraction of recovered individuals R overcomes a second-order phase transition where at T c and below T c the disease cannot spread and above T c the disease infects a significant fraction of the population and becomes an epidemic. Therefore an epidemic occurs only if the number of recovered individuals in the steady state reaches or exceed a minimum size s c . In this letter, we use s c~2 00 for all our simulations [36] .",

After all infected nodes infect their susceptible neighbors with probability b in both layers, the time is increased in one, and the states of the nodes are updated simultaneously.

(3)] is at its minimum and both layers have the same fraction of recovered nodes. This is the case because the layer with the bigger isolated threshold (or the smaller isolated branching factor) can be infected by either its own infection branches or by those coming from the other layer. This second possibility decreases with q. For lower values of q the epidemic threshold increases because the total branching factor is lower and the layer with the lower isolated threshold cannot as effectively infect the other layer. As a consequence, when TwT c the fraction of recovered individuals of the layers detach from each other and show a difference that increases as q?0 [see Eq. (3)]. In this limit, the joined threshold approaches quadratically the threshold of the isolated layer with the higher branching factor. Thus no matter how small the overlapping fraction is, when q?0 the epidemic threshold of the system is given by the lower isolated threshold that corresponds to the layer with the higher propagation capability. This limit is consistent with the results found in Ref. [24] for the SIS model in which the epidemic threshold of the system is dominated by the layer with the lower isolated threshold. Thus although a system of two completely isolated layers is indistinguishable from a system of two layers that share only a few nodes (q?0), the isolated epidemic threshold of the less propagating layer will change discontinuously and acquire the isolated threshold of the other layer.",

We find that the epidemic threshold T c of the multiplex network depends on both the topology of each layer and the overlapping fraction q. Using of a generating function framework, we find the equation for the threshold T c and also the equation for the recovered individuals in the steady state of the spreading process. Our analytical predictions are in agreement with extensive simulation results. Finally, we analyze the fraction of recovered individuals in the steady state as a function of the transmissibility T for layer A and layer B separately. When q?1, we find that the epidemic threshold is at its minimum and, because all individuals belong to both layers, that both layers have the same fraction of recovered nodes for all T. As q decreases, the total branching factor of the system decreases and the epidemic threshold increases, and when TwT c the fraction of recovered individuals in both layers detach from each other. When q?0, the epidemic threshold of the system is dominated by the isolated epidemic threshold of the layer with the larger propagation capability and thus it reaches a higher value. Thus although a system of two completely isolated layers is indistinguishable from a system of two layers that share only a few nodes, the presence of these few shared nodes causes the epidemic threshold of the isolated network with the lower propagating capability to discontinuously change to the threshold of the other network. This result may have important implications for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the propagation of diseases on real scenarios. Our study suggests that vaccinating or isolating only that layer with the higher propagation capacity can drastically reduce the total branching factor of the network, as can be seen from Eq. (3). As a consequence, the epidemic threshold of the system increases significantly, and the risk that a disease epidemic will propagate across the entire network is reduced. and Sk B T~4 and for (b) two power law layers with exponential cutoff c~20 with l A~2 :5 and l B~3 :5, the minimum and maximum values of k where set as k min~2 and k max~5 00, respectively, for both layers.
