Results of individual trials showed that Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (RR 4.00; 95% CI: 2.26 to 7.08), and Xiaoer Resuqing oral liquid (RR 1.43; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.77) had higher cure rates compared with antivirus drugs. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety of CPMs was still uncertain. Conclusions: Some CPMs showed a potential positive effect for the common cold on cure rate. However, due to the poor methodology quality and the defects in the clinical design of the included RCTs, such as the lack of placebo controlled trials, the inappropriate comparison intervention and outcome measurement, the confirmative conclusions on the beneficial effect of CPMs for the common cold could not be drawn.",

There are different categories of 'cold' in TCM, for example, 'wind-cold type cold', 'wind-heat type cold', and 'summer-heat and dampness type cold'. The categories are based on the cause and symptoms of cold, and the medications are different for different type of cold. Chinese patent medicine (CPM) is an important component of Chinese herbs, and is widely accepted by the Chinese people due to the convenience of application. More than 300 CPMs have been approved by the State Food and Drug Administration in China and dozens are listed in the 'China national essential drug list'. It is an authorized list approved by the Ministry of Public Health of China, and provides the basis for the medicine used in medical institutions in China.",

In addition, all the included RCTs enrolled children aged between 6 months to 14 years. The effect of CPMs for adult patients could not be drawn from this review. In our review, we searched all CPMs listed in the 'China national essential drug list 2012'. The reason was that 'China national essential drug list' was the authorized list approved by the Ministry of Public Health of China and was provided as the basis for the medicine used in medical institutions in China. However, although 33 CPMs were recommended in the 'China national essential drug list 2012' for the common cold, only 5 were found have previous clinical evidence.

No RCT stated randomization procedure except one [11] ; the rest just mentioned that 'the patients were randomized into two groups' without providing detailed information to judge whether randomization was conducted properly. Allocation concealment and blinding was not mentioned in any RCT. And because of the different formulation of CPMs and control intervention, it is not likely to be possible to achieve blinding either to investigator or to patients. Therefore, both the investigator and the patients know exactly if they are taking CPMs or conventional medicines. In China, people generally have strong expectations of benefit from CPMs than conventional medicine due to the deeply rooted belief in TCM. We believed that these preferences and expectations might positively bias participants' later responses, especially when the outcome measurement was a more subjective index such as cure rate. Fever clearance time, in contrast, was an objective outcome and was less likely to be affected by participants' expectations. However, only one trial reported the data and the result showed that there was no difference between Chaihu and ribavirin injection on fever clearance time. Previous studies had proven that methodologically poorly designed trials would demonstrate larger differences between experimental and control groups than those conducted rigorously [14, 15] , therefore, we should use caution when interpreting the the small improvements in outcomes in our review.",

            "text": "Secondly, there was lack of placebo control in the included RCTs. The common cold is a mild and selflimiting disease and does not have the proven effective intervention. For this kind of disease, we think a placebo controlled trial is the best choice. In this review, no placebo controlled trial was identified, while the abuse of antibiotics and misuse of antiviral deserved our concern. In our review, the control interventions included antibiotics, antivirus drugs, and antipyretic and analgesic drugs. It is known that antibiotics have no effect against viral infections and thus have no effect against the viruses that cause the common cold. However, in China, antibiotics are quite commonly used for the common cold in clinical practice even if in most of the cases there is no sign of complications of bacterial infection. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. In our review, one RCT [12] used amoxicillin granules as the control intervention, however, it did not report whether there were simultaneous bacterial infections. There are also no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold that have been proven by clinical trials [3] . In this review, two antiviral medicines (ribavirin and moroxydine) were used as the control intervention. In the UK and USA, ribavirin is only used for severe respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infants and children or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (or for chronic hepatitis) [16] [17] [18] . Moroxydine is originally developed as an influenza treatment. In our review, all the patients were enrolled as having simple the common cold, no data was provided on whether the patients was having complications or in high risk categories that needs to be treated by ribavirin and moroxydine, and from the average short treatment period (3 to 5 days), it was less likely that these treatments were for severe respiratory infections. It has been proved that antibiotics could cause significant adverse effects in adults when given for the common cold [5] , and the adverse events of ribavirin was found in treating SARS [19] . Therefore, the risk-benefit of using drugs such as antibiotics and antiviral drugs deserves more attention for future studies of the common cold.",

It was a composite outcome including the clinical symptom disappearance and abatement of fever. It was not an internationally recognized outcome measurement but was commonly used in Chinese TCM trials. However, subtle differences existed in the criteria or cut point in different trials, which made it difficult to interpret the effects of CPMs. Moreover, this outcome measurement was susceptible to subjective bias when assessing the improvement of clinical symptoms. The included RCTs did not state that they have independent outcome assessors. We believed that the outcome assessors were the investigators themselves. This approach was very easy to introduce bias, especially for subjective outcome such as cure rate. Another thing worth noting in this review is that Chinese TCM researchers pay too much attention on the body temperature. Even for the composite outcome measurement of 'cure rate' , body temperature was always a vital component, though different definitions were used. However, fever was just one of the symptoms of the common cold and might not be the primary one because the common cold caused a range of symptoms such as coughing, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. Future TCM researchers should be encouraged to use well validated outcome measurements and to consider all the related symptoms, for example, patient-reported daily symptom diary including symptom variables.",

In addition, the report of patients' syndrome differentiation ('bianzheng' in TCM, a specific diagnosis in TCM) was inadequate. In the practice of TCM, herbal preparations should match the type of syndrome differentiation, and this was thought to be the advantages of TCM. Chinese medicine practitioners believed that treating patients without syndrome differentiation would impair the advantages of Chinese herbs. In our review, only two trials reported patients' syndrome differentiation, the relationship between the efficacy and the pattern of the common cold could not be investigated due to the lack of a group with the opposite pattern of syndromes.

Most of them were not the recommended CPMs listed in the 'China national essential drug list 2012' that was the accepted reference point for the medicines used in medical institutions in China. The CPMs in this review did not include our CPMs. We thought the reason might be the difference in the search strategy and the date of searching. Most of our included RCT were conducted after 2010 which is beyond the searching date of this previous review.",
