Yet, the molecular machineries that drive endocytic recycling remain largely unclear. The CORVET complex is a multi-subunit tether required for fusion between early endosomes. Here we show that the CORVET-specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 also regulate vesicular transport from early to recycling endosomes. Vps3 and Vps8 localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and co-localise with the CHEVI complex on Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Depletion of Vps3 or Vps8 does not affect transferrin recycling, but delays the delivery of internalised integrins to recycling endosomes and their subsequent return to the plasma membrane. Consequently, Vps3/8 depletion results in defects in integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration. These data reveal a role for Vps3 and Vps8 in a specialised recycling pathway important for integrin trafficking.",

            "text": "T he endolysosomal system is important for a variety of cellular processes, such as protein homeostasis, antigen presentation, signal transduction and cell migration. Hence, disruption of endolysosome function is found in a wide range of diseases, from genetic lysosomal storage disorders to cancer and neurodegenerative disorders [1] [2] [3] . The progression of cargo through the endolysosomal system, from early endosomes (EEs) to late endosomes and lysosomes or from EEs to the plasma membrane or recycling endosomes (REs), is tightly controlled by dedicated protein machinery. Membrane fusion is coordinated by the concerted action of Rab GTPases, tethers and soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) 4, 5 . Rab GTPases drive the process by recruiting effector machinery proteins to specific membrane domains 6, 7 . Contact between opposing membranes is then initiated by tethering proteins, followed by SNAREmediated fusion.",

The hexameric CORVET complex consists of a core (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33A), which is shared with the late endosomal homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, and additionally contains the two CORVET-specific subunits Vps8 and Vps3 (also named TGFBRAP1 or TRAP1) 9, 12 . Recycling of endocytosed proteins and membranes from EEs is crucial to maintain plasma membrane homeostasis and is essential for cell polarity, cell migration and cytokinesis. Recycling occurs either directly from EEs to the plasma membrane (fast recycling) or indirectly via Rab11-positive REs (slow recycling) [13] [14] [15] . Both pathways involve Rab4, which resides on EEs as well as on recycling vesicles that emerge from EEs [15] [16] [17] . The class C homologues in endosome-vesicle interaction (CHEVI) complex consisting of Vps33B and VIPAS39, homologues of Vps33A and Vps16, respectively, binds to Rab11 and localises to REs 18-20 . Mutations in Vps33B or VIPAS39 underlie arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder that affects the transport of apical and junctional proteins in polarised cells 18, 19, 21 .",

Immunogold double labelling showed that Vps18 co-localises with Vps3 on EEs, but was absent from Vps3-positive vesicles (Fig. 1b , asterisks), indicating that Vps3 and Vps8 localise to recycling vesicles, which lack CORVET core components. We then co-expressed GFP-Vps3, HA-Vps8 or the CORVET core subunit GFP-Vps11, together with mCherry-tagged Rab4, Rab5 or Rab11, and assessed their co-localisation by quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. We found that Vps3 ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and Vps8 (Fig. 1c, d) significantly colocalised with Rab5 and Rab4, which label EEs and EE-derived recycling vesicles, respectively 17, 22 , and partially with the RE marker Rab11 (Fig. 1c , d and Supplementary Fig. 1a) , indicative for the presence of Vps3 and Vps8 on EEs as well as on recycling vesicles. By contrast, GFP-Vps11 only notably overlapped with Rab5 ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b) , reinforcing the notion that CORVET core components are present on EEs but not on recycling vesicles. To facilitate the distinction of Rab5 and Rab4 subdomains within EEs by IF microscopy, we expressed the constitutively active Rab5Q79L mutant, which increases the size of EEs 22, 23 . Strikingly, co-expression of GFP-Rab5Q79L with HA-Vps8 and FLAG-Rab4 revealed that HA-Vps8 specifically concentrated in FLAG-Rab4-positive patches (Fig. 1e , arrows) and protrusions ( Supplementary Fig. 1c , arrows) of GFP-Rab5Q79L-positive EEs. To further confirm that Vps3 and Vps8 reside on the same recycling vesicles as Rab4 we performed IEM of HeLa cells expressing HA-Vps8 or HA-Vps3 with GFP-Rab4.

Since we find that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise on recycling vesicles that lack CORVET core components, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-binding experiments to investigate whether mammalian Vps3 and Vps8 bind directly to each other. In agreement with this scenario, co-IP experiments in HeLa cells revealed that endogenous Vps8 readily coimmunoprecipitated with overexpressed GFP-Vps3, while less Vps8 was recovered with GFP-tagged Vps11, Vps16 or Vps41, the HOPS-specific subunit that is most homologous to Vps8 (Fig. 2a , full blots in Supplementary Fig. 2 ). To investigate whether Vps3 can directly bind Vps8 we probed the binding of full-length GST-Vps3 purified from bacterial lysates with in vitro-translated HA-Vps8. Importantly, GST-Vps3 interacted directly with HA-Vps8 (Fig. 2b , full blots in Supplementary Fig. 3 ). By expressing truncation mutants of GST-Vps3, we could map the Vps8 interacting domain to the C terminus of Vps3 (Fig. 2b) , which also confirms the specificity of the binding assays. Finally, to quantify the interaction of Vps3 with Vps8, Vps11 or Vps16 we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in HeLa cells. This showed a significantly higher PLA signal between Vps3 and Vps8, than between Vps3 and Vps11 or Vps16 (Fig. 2c, d) .",

            "text": "Vps3 and Vps8 are required for recycling of \u03b21 integrins. To assess which cargo is transported by the Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, we first determined the effect of Vps3 and Vps8 depletion on transferrin (Tf) recycling. We depleted both subunits to fully prevent any function related to the interaction between residual Vps3 and Vps8. Endocytosed Tf recycles either directly from EEs to the plasma membrane or indirectly via REs, while dextran is transported to the lysosome for degradation 28 . A block in recycling increases inclusion of Tf in the degradative pathway to the lysosome, and therefore increases the co-localisation between Tf and dextran 29, 30 . Vps3/8 depletion had no effect on Tf localisation, indicating that the recycling of Tf was not disturbed (Fig. 4a, b) . These data are in line with a previous study showing that Vps3 is not required for Tf recycling 8 . In addition to the common recycling pathway taken by Tf, specific recycling pathways are described for cell-surface proteins such as integrins [31] [32] [33] . To study a potential role of Vps3 and Vps8 in the recycling of \u03b21 integrins we used an established antibody-based integrin recycling assay 34 . HeLa cells were depleted of Vps3 and Vps8, and then serum-starved overnight, labelled with anti-\u03b21 integrin, washed and chased for 2 h. In the absence of serum, \u03b21 integrins accumulate in REs (Fig. 4c, arrows) . Vps3/8 knockdown prevented the accumulation of \u03b21 integrins, which instead retained a dispersed distribution throughout the cell Ratio internalisation Vps3/8KD/Scrambled ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Using an adapted IEM protocol to visualise the antibody uptake as described above, we could identify the accumulations in control cells as large clusters of recycling tubules and vesicles (Fig. 4d, left panel) . Importantly, IEM of the Vps3/8 knockdown cells showed that internalised \u03b21 integrins still entered EEs and EE-associated recycling vesicles (Fig. 4d, right panel) . These data show that the block in \u03b21 integrin recycling induced by Vps3/8 knockdown occurs after exit from EEs, and interferes with the transport of recycling vesicles to REs. Re-addition of serum induced integrin recycling in control cells resulting in the disappearance of intracellular accumulations, while the localisation of internalised \u03b21 integrins in knockdown cells remained unchanged ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Together these results imply that Vps3/8 knockdown prevents or delays internalised \u03b21 integrins to reach REs and thereby prevents clearance of the intracellular pool. We next investigated the impact of Vps3/8 knockdown on the kinetics of integrin recycling by studying the fibronectin (FN)binding integrin \u03b15\u03b21 35 . In short, cells were surface-labelled with cleavable biotin and endocytosis was allowed for 30 min in the absence of serum. Surface biotin was removed and recycling was induced by re-addition of serum. Surface biotin was removed again and the reduction of intracellular biotinylated \u03b15 integrin before and after recycling was quantified using capture ELISA. This assay showed that knockdown of Vps3/8 resulted in a significant decrease of \u03b15\u03b21 recycling, especially after short recycling times (Fig. 4f) , while the internalisation of \u03b15\u03b21 as not affected (Fig. 4g) . Finally, to verify that \u03b15\u03b21 is indeed transported by Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, we labelled the \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin subunits for IEM. This unequivocally demonstrated that integrin \u03b15\u03b21 is present in the Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles (Fig. 4h) .",

To investigate whether Vps3 and Vps8 are required for integrin-dependent cell adhesion, we seeded HeLa Vps3/8 knockdown cells on FN or collagen-I (Col-I) in the absence of serum. Non-adherent cells were washed away after 5, 15 or 30 min, and the number of attached cells was quantified. This revealed that adhesion to both FN (Fig. 5a) and Col-I (Fig. 5b) was significantly compromised in Vps3/8 knockdown cells. Individual knockdown of Vps3 or Vps8 also reduced cell adhesion, but the effect was less stringent, suggesting that residual expression in single-knockdown cells still allows a functional interaction between Vps3 and Vps8, while in the doubleknockdown cells this is more completely abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 8a) . Importantly, different siRNA oligos induced essentially the same results, rendering it unlikely that the observed adhesion defect is due to off-target effects (Supplementary Fig. 8b) .",

By IEM and IF, we show that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise on EEs as well as on Rab4-positive, EE-associated recycling vesicles and tubules that lack CORVET core components. In addition, we find Vps3/8 on Rab11-positive REs. By co-IP and assays using purified proteins we show strong interactions between Vps3 and Vps8, demonstrating that they can interact directly with each other. In addition, we show by IEM that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise with the CHEVI complex on REs. Based on our data we propose that Vps3 and Vps8 are recruited to EEs together with CORVET core Fig. 4 Vps3 and Vps8 are required for recycling of \u03b21 integrins but not Tf. a HeLa cells knocked down for Vps3, Vps8 or Vps3/8 were incubated with green fluorescent dextran and red fluorescent Tf for 2 h and visualised by fluorescence microscopy. b Quantification of a, co-localisation analysis from three separate experiments with n > 40 cells showed no block of Tf recycling. Error bars represent SD. c Integrin recycling assay as described 34 . HeLa cells knocked down for Vps3/8 were serum-starved overnight and labelled with anti-\u03b21 integrin on ice. After 2 h uptake at 37\u00b0C, followed by fixation and labelling with fluorescent secondary antibodies, \u03b21 integrin accumulation in REs (arrows) was visualised by IF. In knockdown cells, no accumulation of integrin was found, indicating that the trafficking to REs is blocked. d IEM of cells subjected to the integrin uptake assay as in c and immunogold-labelled for endocytosed anti-\u03b21 integrin (10 nm gold). Accumulations of endocytosed \u03b21 integrin are by IEM identified as a cluster of tubular membranes (left panel, cluster accented by white dashed line, inset shows magnification of membrane tubules).

Error bars represent SD. g Internalisation of integrins measured using the ELISA data of f. The experimental replicates were compared using the ratio between Vps3/8 KD and scrambled cells. The ratio of~1.0 indicates no significant difference in internalisation between conditions. Error bars represent SD. h IEM of HeLa cells loaded with BSA-Au5 expressing GFP-Vps3. GFP-Vps3 (10 nm gold) co-localises with the endogenous \u03b21 (15 nm gold, left panel) and \u03b15 integrin subunits ( components, after which they localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles, which set out to fuse with Rab11-and CHEVI-positive REs (Fig. 6) . The Vps3/Vps8-dependent recycling pathway is required for efficient recycling of internalised \u03b21 integrins, and perturbation of Vps3 or Vps8 impairs integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, FA assembly and cell migration. Rab4 has been implicated in the short-loop recycling from EEs to the plasma membrane, as well as in the long-loop recycling from EEs to Rab11-positive REs 13, [15] [16] [17] 22, 43, 44 . Since Vps3/8 knockdown prevents delivery of \u03b21 integrins to REs (Fig. 4c, f) , we conclude that Vps3 and Vps8 are involved in transport from EEs to REs (Fig. 6 ). Our finding that Vps3 and Vps8 interact with each other (Fig. 2) and localise to recycling vesicles that lack the CORVET core subunit Vps18 (Fig. 1 ) could indicate the formation of a Vps3/8 complex independently of the CORVET core subunits. A direct interaction between Vps3 and Vps8 has been found before 8 , but seemed counterintuitive since in the current CORVET model Vps3 and Vps8 are located at opposite ends of the complex 45 . The formation of a Vps3/8 complex without other CORVET core components would provide a functional and structural explanation for these findings. Interestingly, Vps39 and Vps41, the counterparts of Vps3 and Vps8 residing on the opposite ends of the HOPS complex, can also directly interact with each other 24 , possibly by obtaining a closed post-fusion conformation of HOPS following late endosome-lysosome fusion 45, 46 . In analogy herewith, a closed post EE-EE fusion conformation of the CORVET complex could precede the direct interaction of Vps3 and Vps8. Future studies on endogenous proteins are however required to determine if there is indeed a functional Vps3/8 complex formed and whether this requires the presence of additional proteins.",

            "text": "As a crucial mechanism to control integrin function, endocytic recycling of integrins is a topic of extensive research 39, [47] [48] [49] . Integrins use multiple recycling pathways depending on heterodimer composition, conformation (active or inactive) and ligand binding. A key question is how sorting to these different pathways is achieved. Interestingly, we found that Vps3/8 knockdown had no effect on Tf recycling (Fig. 4a, b) . Tf recycling depends on Rab4 and Rab11, which are also involved in integrin recycling 13, 30, 34, 38, 50 . However, in contrast to Tf, recycling of \u03b21 integrins depends on a NPxY motif that in EEs binds SNX17 or SNX31 to sort integrins into recycling vesicles [51] [52] [53] . This suggests that within the Rab4/Rab11 pathway multiple sub-pathways exist. Recently, a new protein complex, retriever, has been identified that associates with SNX17 on EEs and sorts \u03b15\u03b21 integrin from the early endosome to the recycling pathway 54 . Retriever is therefore a likely candidate to mediate sorting of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin into the Vps3/8 recycling pathway. Together these data suggest that the interplay between CORVET, retriever, CHEVI and a possible Vps3/8 complex is important for integrin recycling. In analogy with the concept of EE-associated tubular sorting endosomes or networks, machinery proteins involved in cargo sorting might define subdomains on REs 27, 55, 56 . At the level of REs, the CHEVI protein Vps33B is a putative candidate to define exits specialised for integrin recycling, since it interacts directly with integrin \u03b2-subunits 57 . Future studies are required to define additional cargo for the retriever-Vps3/8-CHEVI-dependent recycling pathway.",

Sample preparation, ultrathin cryosectioning and immunolabelling were performed as described61 . In brief, HeLa cells were grown on 60 mm dishes and fixed by the addition of freshly prepared 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to an equal volume of culture medium for 10 min, followed by postfixation with fresh 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Fixed cells were washed in PBS containing 0.05 M glycine and gently scraped in PBS containing 1% gelatine. Cells were pelleted in 12% gelatin in PBS, which was then left to solidify on ice and cut into small blocks. The blocks were infiltrated overnight in 2.3 M sucrose at 4\u00b0C, mounted on aluminium pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 70 nm ultrathin cryosections were cut on a Leica ultracut UCT cryomicrotome and picked up in a freshly prepared 1:1 mixture of 2.3 M sucrose and 1.8% methylcellulose. Sections were then immunogold-labelled with antibodies and protein A gold, contrasted and examined on a JEOL transmission electron microscope 1010.",
