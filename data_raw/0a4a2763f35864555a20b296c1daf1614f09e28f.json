            "text": "Candida is the most common fungal pathogen of humans worldwide and has become a major clinical problem because of the growing number of immunocompromised patients, who are susceptible to infection. Moreover, the number of available antifungals is limited, and antifungal-resistant Candida strains are emerging. New and effective antifungals are therefore urgently needed. Here, we discovered a small molecule with activity against Candida spp. both in vitro and in vivo. We screened a library of 50,240 small molecules for inhibitors of yeast-to-hypha transition, a major virulence attribute of Candida albicans. This screening identified 20 active compounds. Further examination of the in vitro antifungal and antibiofilm properties of these compounds, using a range of Candida spp., led to the discovery of SM21, a highly potent antifungal molecule (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.2 -1.6 mg/ml). In vitro, SM21 was toxic to fungi but not to various human cell lines or bacterial species and was active against Candida isolates that are resistant to existing antifungal agents. Moreover, SM21 was relatively more effective against biofilms of Candida spp. than the current antifungal agents. In vivo, SM21 prevented the death of mice in a systemic candidiasis model and was also more effective than the common antifungal nystatin at reducing the extent of tongue lesions in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. Propidium iodide uptake assay showed that SM21 affected the integrity of the cell membrane. Taken together, our results indicate that SM21 has the potential to be developed as a novel antifungal agent for clinical use.",

            "text": "The most prevalent candidiasis-causing species is Candida albicans. It has a versatile morphogenesis, existing in three forms (i.e., yeasts, pseudohyphae and hyphae), and has two lifestyles (planktonic and biofilm), permitting C. albicans to thrive under diverse environmental conditions. In particular, the yeast-to-hypha (Y-H) transition is a major virulence attribute that facilitates tissue invasion by C. albicans [7, 8] . In addition to Y-H transition, biofilm formation on host tissue or abiotic devices is also a significant basis for Candida infections [5] , examples include Candida-associated denture stomatitis [9] . The formation of Candida biofilms, which are more resistant to antifungal agents than planktonic cells, is directly associated with treatment failure [5, 10] . Although Candida infections have always posed a heavy burden on public health, this situation has recently worsened. First, the worldwide incidence of candidiasis has been increasing over the past few decades [11] , which may be attributable to increased numbers of immunocompromised patients and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [12] . Second, the increased incidence of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei or Candida parapsilosis, has been a major concern [13, 14] , because these infections are often associated with higher mortality and antifungal resistance than those caused by C. albicans [15, 16] . Lastly, the emergence of antifungal resistance and treatment side effects have further restricted treatment options because of the already limited arsenal of current antifungal agents [17, 18] .",

Polyenes, for example, have dose-related toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity (even though the recent introduction of lipid formulations has now improved the risk-benefit ratio) [20] . In addition, rising drug resistance is an inevitable problem. This is pertinent for fluconazole, a drug of choice for treating AIDS patients with Candida infections. While C. glabrata and C. krusei are intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, the emergence of fluconazoleresistant C. albicans strains is also on the rise [21, 22] . Similarly, emerging resistance has also been reported for the more recently introduced echinocandins [23] [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, the situation is likely to be ameliorated only by the discovery and introduction of safe and new antifungal agents.",

Immediately before infection, the mice were anesthetised with 50 ml chlorpromazine chloride (2 mg/ml) via intramuscular injection on each femur. The oral cavities of the anesthetised mice were swabbed with a sterilised cotton swab that had been dipped in a cell suspension of C. albicans SC5314 (2.5610 7 CFUs/ml; from cultures grown overnight at 37uC on SDA). Subsequently, 10 ml SM21 (200 mg/ ml; n = 3), 10 ml nystatin (10 mg/ml; n = 3) or 10 ml PBS (as a control; n = 3) was administered to the mice by pipetting into their mouths; this was done five times, at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h after inoculation. The mice were sacrificed 72 h after infection and were immediately observed macroscopically for tongue lesions. The tongue lesion degree was evaluated using a scoring system of 0 -3 [40] , with 0 denoting a healthy tongue surface and 3 the most severe stage. The entire oral cavities of the mice were swabbed with sterilised cotton swabs, which were then submerged in 500 ml PBS and vortexed vigorously. The resultant suspension was spiral plated on SDA, and the number of CFUs was counted after incubation at 37uC for 24 h. In addition, the invasion of tongue tissues by Candida was evaluated histologically by PAS staining, as described above.",

At day 5 (the experimental end point) after infection with C. albicans, all of the untreated mice with systemic candidiasis had died, whereas all of the SM21-treated mice were alive ( Figure 12A ). The fungal burden in the kidneys was significantly lower in the SM21-treated mice than in the untreated ones ( Figure 12B ). Moreover, white Candida lesions were visible covering the surfaces of the kidneys of the untreated mice, while the kidneys of the SM21-treated mice appeared healthy ( Figure 12C ). Clusters of Candida hyphae were easily identified in PAS-stained kidneys of the untreated mice, whereas very few Candida cells were observed in the kidney parenchyma of the SM21-treated mice ( Figure 12D ). These results indicated that SM21 was effective in preventing systemic spread and invasion of Candida in the mouse model.",

However, the therapeutic potential of these small molecules is unclear, because they have been evaluated mainly for the ability to inhibit C. albicans virulence properties such as Y-H transition or biofilm formation in vitro. It has been hypothesised that arresting Candida in the unicellular yeast form would result in reduced virulence. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that non-filamentous C. albicans mutants are not virulent in a mouse infection model [48] , however, this is only relevant to C. albicans. Some NAC species (which do not form true hyphae) are also virulent. Moreover, the strategy of inhibiting virulence factors could facilitate the emergence of resistant strains because it only inhibits the growth of virulent strains but does not kill them. Complete elimination of pathogen is clearly a safer option; therefore, fungicidal drugs are preferred. Figure 11 . Effect of SM21 treatment in Candida-HOK co-culture model. The viability of co-cultured HOKs and yeast cells in the presence of SM21 was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescent probes.

It should be noted that the Y-H inhibitor screening assay selects for molecules that block the change from the yeast form of C. albicans to the hyphal form, as assessed by morphology. Therefore, this assay does not discriminate between molecules that inhibit the growth of C. albicans, which would also prevent the Y-H transition, and true inhibitors of the Y-H transition. Moreover, conventional antifungal agents such as fluconazole, amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, whose mechanisms are not directly related to Y-H inhibition, also inhibit the formation of hyphae [49] .

Although this value is lower than the minimum CC 50 (16 mM) reported for 14 antifungal compounds that were identified by LaFleur et al (tested against human fibroblasts in 96-well plates; [45] ), the CC 50 of SM21 is still higher than its MIC (0.2 mg/ml), which indicates that there is a range of concentrations at which SM21 could be used as an antifungal agent without causing significant toxicity to human cells. Indeed, no detrimental effects were observed in mice that had been injected with SM21 doses as high as 10 mg/kg twice daily. In addition, SM21 does not seem to have antibacterial properties, indicating that its target is present in fungi but not in bacteria.",

            "text": "We demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of SM21 is an effective treatment for systemic candidiasis in a mouse model. An SM21 dose of 0.1 mg/kg or higher twice daily beginning 3 h post-infection significantly reduced fungal burden in non-neutropenic mice. The in vivo efficacy of SM21 is similar to that of conventional antifungal agents in comparable non-neutropenic mouse models of systemic C. albicans candidiasis. For example, the intraperitoneal ED 50 (50% effective dose) of fluconazole is 4.56 mg/kg when administered to the mice as a single dose 5 h after infection; the animals were sacrificed 24 h later [55] . Intraperitoneal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg dose daily) decreases fungal burden in mouse kidneys from day 1 to day 3 after infection (with treatment beginning 24 h after infection) [56] . In addition, intravenous micafungin treatment (0.125 mg/kg or higher daily dose, starting 1 h after infection for 4 days) prolongs survival of infected mice [57] . However, it is difficult to compare the effective doses from different studies because there is no standard protocol, and differences in the Candida strain, inoculum size, mouse strain, mouse immune status and the start and interval of antifungal therapy could interfere with the outcome. In addition, there are differences in the in vivo drug efficacy among normal and neutropenic murine models, which may be due to the possible interactions between the drug and host defence mechanisms [56] . Detailed pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetics studies would need to be performed in the future to determine the time/concentration relationship of the drug at the infection sites and, thus, to generate the dosing regimens that produce the best treatment outcome in vivo [58] .",

Growth inhibition zones were observed for SM21 against the two C. albicans strains tested. The growth inhibition zones produced by SM21 were clear, similar to those produced by amphotericin B, but dissimilar to those produced by fluconazole. This phenomenon suggested that SM21 is, like amphotericin B, fungicidal in nature. (TIF)",

Cell morphology of C. albicans SC5314 was observed by light microscopy after incubation in the presence of different concentrations of the 20 primary hits under hyphal-inducing conditions (Lee's medium and incubation at 37uC). The degree of Y-H inhibition was quantified by calculating the percentage of hyphal cells in one hundred cells in a single sample. The average percentage of hyphae in the treated samples was normalised to the average percentage of hyphae in the positive control (taken as 100%).
