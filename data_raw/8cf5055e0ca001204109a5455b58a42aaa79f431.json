Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I 2 = 99\u00c12%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23\u00c11% to 95\u00c18% willingness to work, depending on context. Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness. Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable. Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work despite significant heterogeneity between studies. None of the included studies were based on appropriate theoretical constructs of population behaviour.",

Our planned subgroup analyses were unable to adequately explain the sources of heterogeneity between studies as this remained above our threshold of 85% in each analysis. The percentage of willingness to work seemed to depend on the particular context of the study. Studies of hypothetical influenza pandemics, which did not include detailed conditions such as virulence of the strain and availability of protective equipment, tended to show a high level of willingness to work. However, studies of precise scenarios or those which investigated willingness during the relatively mild influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic tended to present relatively low levels of willingness. This finding may correspond with earlier work by Syrett et al. 24 which showed that willingness Factors associated with willingness to work Data were extracted from 33 studies. Pooled estimates from meta-analyses of individual factors associated with willingness to work are summarized in Table 2 . Overall, females were one-third less likely to be willing to work compared with males. By occupational group, physicians were most likely to be willing to work, followed by nurses, then other health workers. Urban or metropolitan area workers were less likely to be willing to work than rural area workers. Full-time workers were more likely to be willing to work than parttime employees. Respondents living with children or having childcare obligations were one-third less likely to be willing to work compared with those without these obligations. One study identified that pregnancy in a family member reduced willingness to work. 25 Marital status (not meta-analysed) did not influence willingness to work. Perceived personal safety at work and perception of pandemic risk (aware that a pandemic was likely) were both associated with increased willingness to work. Likewise, the provision of protective measures (mainly personal protective equipment) increased willingness to work, although metaanalysis was abandoned due to high heterogeneity (I 2 = 97\u00c18%).",

However, quality of the included studies was not uniformly high and excessive statistical heterogeneity prevented metaanalysis of the primary outcome measure. Whilst it was not possible to identify a single clear source of the heterogeneity encountered, almost certainly the wide variation in settings, scenarios and respondents contributed significantly. Metaanalysis suggested that sex and job category would affect willingness to work although studies varied greatly in the composition of their samples. Hypothetical scenarios varied in virulence, stage and the amount of information provided to respondents. Studies of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were conducted at different junctures during the evolution of the 2009-10 pandemic. There was no consistency in terms of how respondents were asked about their willingness to work, and the design of questionnaires used to collect outcome data from respondents varied between studies. Remarkably, despite such high heterogeneity, some factors emerged showing a consistent association with willingness to work. Whilst previous reviews suggested these from a narrative approach, this study has confirmed them statistically.",

The importance of this factor may be an artefact of the high participation of women in the HCW workforce in most countries, combined with traditional cultural expectations that they will take primary responsibility for childcare. It is, nevertheless, an important finding for managers. It is not clear whether this is driven mainly by practicality, that is the need to provide childcare at home, or by concerns about whether the safety of children might be compromised by infection brought in from the parental workplace. Paradoxically, the evidence that HCWs are at increased risk of influenza infection is rather mixed and somewhat inconsistent, 26 whereas the evidence that children (rather than adults) are usually the introducers of influenza infection into households is firmly established. 27 This question should be further investigated because it has implications for appropriate organizational responses. If it is simply a practical matter, then managers need to consider what help could be given in emergencies through the expansion of onsite or community childcare provision. If it is a concern about cross-infection, then appropriate education and information programmes may resolve the problem. In either case, it is unlikely that simple disciplinary sanctions will be effective, because of the social force of parental obligations. Indeed, these may well be counterproductive, if other workers perceive them to have been unreasonably applied by managers unsympathetic to real personal dilemmas.",

The possibility of publication bias might also be a limitation. However, considering that the percentage of willingness was relatively high in most studies, this suggests that unpublished data may not have found statistically significantly higher percentages of willingness to work. Whilst some studies used questionnaires based on recognized psychological theories, these were commonly 'fear-appeal' theories. Unfortunately, this may not be appropriate as the preferable behaviour (working during an influenza pandemic) would not result in release from personal fear. 30 We did not identify any studies that investigated the interaction between individual and organizational responses, which biased the findings towards individual fears rather than the social conditions that might provoke or alleviate these.",

Whilst the above would hold true for influenza, the actual risks and perceptions are not consistent across all novel respiratory viruses. For example, 5% of nurses in Ontario refused to work during the SARS crisis when the risk to HCWs was almost exclusively nosocomial (compared with pandemic influenza where the risk is community-wide). 31 Similarly, in the ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic, the risk of nosocomial infection is presently greater than in wider community settings. 32, 33 Conclusions HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic is moderately high although highly variable, and substantial statistical heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis. Numerous risk factors are associated with willingness of HCWs to work during an influenza pandemic, revealing potential points of intervention to increase willingness to work.
