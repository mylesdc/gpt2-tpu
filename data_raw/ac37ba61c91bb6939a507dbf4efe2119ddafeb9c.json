The causative pathogen was identified as a novel betacoronavirus within the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) family, recently termed SARS-CoV-2 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In response to the outbreak, several countries including Thailand, established thermal screening at the airport for travellers from Wuhan since 3 January. On 8 January and 13 January, suspected cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 were identified at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. We report the investigation, basic clinical characteristics and viral genomes derived from these cases.",

Her measured temperature at the arrival gate was 38.6 \u00b0C by thermoscanner, and confirmed with a tympanic thermometer. After being interviewed by quarantine officers, she was transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute (BIDI) Hospital, Nonthaburi, for isolation and laboratory investigations. She reported a runny nose and sore throat but no dyspnea or diarrhoea. Upon admission, her vital signs were normal except for elevated blood pressure. Her physical examination was unremarkable including inconspicuous lung sounds. Her complete blood count suggested a viral infection from relatively decreased neutrophil (48%; norm: 35-75%) to lymphocyte (40%; norm: 20-59%) ratio [8] . The chest X-ray (CXR) results on 8 January were compatible with pneumonia with mild thickening lung marking at both lower lungs possibly because of crowded lung rather than infiltration. It also showed borderline cardiomegaly. Repeat CXR after 7 days showed no remarkable changes.",

Similar to case 1, the first CXR taken on 13 January, showed thickening interstitial lung marking at both lower lung fields and both perihilar regions because of interstitial infiltration or crowded lung marking, mild cardiomegaly and dilated aorta. Follow-up CXR on 17 January additionally showed recent hazy with reticular opacities at left middle lung field. The patient was not in severe condition but stable.",

Structural mapping of mutations in the spike glycoprotein between SARS CoV and the two cases of the SARS-CoV-2 reported here shows only 76% identity at the protein level ( Figure 1B ). This surface protein is critical for ACE2 host receptor interaction and is also a target of the immune response [12, 13] . Given several mutations in the binding interface, it may differ in host cell binding efficiency compared with SARS-CoV which could result in differences in virulence and transmission potential [14, 15] .",

Therefore, while one cannot exclude the possibility that asymptomatic cases in their incubation period would be missed and become infectious later, screening of incoming travellers from an affected area proved successful at least in these two instances, when COVID-19 cases were detected, isolated, observed and only discharged once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Further, according to information provided by the cases, they have no direct link to the Huanan Seafood Market but their genomes are identical to four sequences from Wuhan collected on 30 December 2019 and sequenced by three different laboratories, indicating potential wider distribution in the city. Although within-outbreak sequence divergence is low for this virus, identical genomes of up to 30 kb are rare and a strong sign of recent transmission linkage, albeit with unknown number of generations within the transmission chain. The missing link to the market, the time of travel and onset of symptoms in the two COVID-19 cases together with the incubation period of mean 6.4 days (range: 5.6-7.7)[16] and the time of closest genome neighbours obtained from sequences in Wuhan, suggest that transmission within Wuhan beyond the Huanan Seafood Market is likely to have occurred in the first week of January or earlier.",
