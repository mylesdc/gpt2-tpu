A two-dimensional liquid chromatography ( 2 D-LC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) method was firstly established to separate and identify chemical components in YPF. A total of 33 compounds were identified, including 15 constituents (flavonoids and saponins) in Astragali radix; seven constituents (sesquiterpenoids and polysaccharide) in Atractylodis rhizoma; and 11 constituents (chromone and coumarins) in Saposhnikoviae radix. The corresponding fragmentation pathway of typical substances was investigated. Then, seven active constituents (astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, sec-O-glucosylhamaudol, and atractylenolide II) derived from three medicinal plants were chosen to further investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of YPF formula using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry system. The method was sensitive, accurate and reliable. We also used the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0\u2212\u221e ) as weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic curve. Results show that the constituents of Saposhnikoviae radix have the best absorption and pharmacokinetic behavior and may play important role in leading to the changes of overall therapeutic effects of YPF. Further study is needed to confirm the association between them.",

It contains three unique medicinal plants ( Figure S1 ), Astragali radix, Atractylodis rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae radix, in a ratio of 3:1:1 by weight of dried plants. Furthermore, numerous pharmacological studies exhibited that there were varieties of flavonoids and saponins in Astragali radix [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; sesquiterpenoids in Atractylodis rhizoma; and chromones and coumarins [16] in Saposhnikoviae radix, which show anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunosuppressive activities, as well as their glycoside counterparts [17] [18] [19] [20] .

In this study, 2 D-LC-QTOF-MS was established to separate and identify chemical compounds in YPF, and 33 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized. The corresponding fragmentation pathway of typical substances was investigated. Then, a rapid, simple and validated method using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS) system was developed for simultaneously quantification of astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, atractylenolide II, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol in rat plasma with relatively low concentration. We applied this method to pharmacokinetic study of YPF orally administered, and used the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0\u2212\u221e ) as the weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic behavior for those main active ingredients, which was firstly elucidated.",

However, their synergistic mechanisms are poorly understood and must be addressed using a more holistic approach [6] . Pharmacokinetic studies might further provide physiologically relevant clues to the target identification and mechanistic study of TCM formula [7] .

Given the complexity of chemical constituents of YPF, we needed to obtain the best peak capacity and maximize the meaningful difference between variable contents of chemicals in two dimensional system. The primary consideration is complete orthogonal separation mechanism, which is currently hard to achieve in reality; the most common used system consists of normal phase chromatographic columns combine with C18 (reverse phase) column. In addition, the major components of YPF decoction were all water-soluble, thus we evaluate the separation efficiency of CN ( Figure 1A ), Halo Hilic (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography) ( Figure 1B) , and TSKgel Amide ( Figure 1C ) columns (normal phase chromatographic columns), which are hydrophilic as the first dimension because all separate substances based on differences in hydrophilicity. The 1 D-NPLC chromatograms of the crude decocted extract of YPF were shown on Figure 1C . Almost 42 peaks could be seen clearly. It is obvious that amide column has the best peak resolution and sensitivity compared with the other two. The packing material of amide column is carbamoyl instead of aminopropyl groups bonded to silica gel, the bonded phase was significantly efficient in analysis of polysaccharides and glycosides, which exist in the herbs Astragali radix [12, 13] , Atractylodis rhizoma [17] and Saposhnikoviae radix [22] , as well as the flavonoids, lactones, volatile oil, etc. [13] .

The fractions of YPF water decoction were collected and concentrated after separation in the first NPLC system respectively, which would increase the concentration of the sample. Samples diluted by mobile phase of first dimension would reduce the detection limit of the second dimension. In order to overcome this shortcoming as well as eliminate the influence of solvent incompatibility, this experiment adopted the method of concentrating samples manually, each fraction eluted from amide column in the same period of time were collected after 10 times sample injection, and concentrated to dry under nitrogen, then dissolved in 100 \u03bcL methanol-water (1:1, v/v) for analysis by second dimension chromatography.",

Hence, UPLC-QTOF-MS using C18 chromatographic columns (as the second dimension) was established to isolate the five fractions from 1 D-NPLC. A representative can be seen in Figure 2 . For comparison, a 1 D-UPLC-QTOF-MS chromatogram of the crude decocted extract of YPF is also shown (Figure 2A ). It is obvious that the 2 D method has successfully enriched the peak capacity and improved the resolution as well. There are 3306 molecular features presented in total from all five fractions. 2 D-NPLC/UPLC-QTOF-MS method was proven to be efficient in analysis of chemical constituents from the extract of YPF. ",

The background noise was very low, and the absence of endogenous interference at or close to the retention time of the analytes clearly proves the high selectivity of the method. Linearity and sensitivity: Lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) is calculated as the lowest level of the analytes that can be reliably detected with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 10, and reproduced with an accuracy of 80-120%. Summary of regression equations, coefficient and LLOQs of the seven analytes in blank rat plasma are presented in Table 5 . All calibration curves exhibited good linearity with coefficient of determination (r 2 ) within the range of 0.995-0.999. The LLOQs were sensitive enough for quantitative detection of analytes in the pharmacokinetic studies. Accuracy and precision: Intra-day and inter-day precision was expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) should not exceed 15% (or \u00b120% for LLOQ), and the accuracy was denoted by the proximity to the theoretical concentration relative error (RE) ((true value of concentration \u2212 observed value of concentration)/(true value of concentration) \u00d7 100%) should be within \u00b115% (or \u00b120% for LLOQ). Table 6 summarizes the accuracy, precision, recovery and matrix effect data of the seven analytes with different concentrations of low, medium and high in rat plasma (n = 5), Intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 13% in terms of RSD%, and the accuracy (RE%) was below 15%, with only one exception of cimicifugoside (17%) at its lowest concentration, which is still be acceptable (\u226420%). These values indicate that the overall reproducibility of the method is within the bioanalytical method validation acceptance criteria as per FDA and EMA guidelines. Table 6 .

Matrix effect and recovery: The results of matrix effect and recovery are also summarized in Table 6 , from which we can see that the extraction recoveries of analytes and matrix effect are all in the range of 75-120%, with only the recovery of calycosin at 122%, a little bit over the criteria. The other results show this method was consistent, precise and reproducible. Stability: The analytes would be considered stable when the accuracy bias was within \u00b115% of the nominal concentrations (or \u00b120% for LLOQ). Table 7 shows the results of stability studies under different conditions: the measured concentrations for seven analytes at each QC level were within \u00b113.5% of nominal values, indicating that they were stable under all conditions tested.

However, as discussed above, Astragali radix constitutes the most important part of YPF prescription, and we chose only seven main ingredients that have clear anti-inflammatory activity in YPF formula in this study. Therefore, it has its own limitations. We believed that plasma drug concentration of certain points can be regarded as the combination of all quantitative components in vivo, but, considering the huge differences of drug distribution and rate of elimination, the combination will be more complicated than simple multiplication, since the parameter of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0\u2212\u221e ) is very important for drug efficacy and pharmacology, it can reflects the drug exposure directly. Meanwhile, to measure the intracorporal drug exposure contribution of each component, we choose the ratio of single to overall components AUC 0\u2212\u221e as the weighting factor. Ct is self-defined integrated plasma drug concentration of total components after weight factor correction. The integrated pharmacokinetic curve shows that the integrated pharmacokinetic characteristics are different from that of any of the single ingredients, which indicates that the single ingredient pharmacokinetic characteristics cannot fully reflect the drug metabolism of the overall medicine formula in vivo. Further study is needed to confirm the association between them. We hope to provide a new valuable method for the drug metabolism research of traditional Chinese medicine.",

Then, a rapid, simple and reproducible UPLC-QqQ-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantification of seven major constituents, astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, atractylenolide II, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol, in rat plasma with relatively low concentrations.

In addition, we also used the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0\u2212\u221e ) as the weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic curve, which may offer a broader perspective for discovering and elucidating the pharmacokinetic behavior and clinical application of the whole YPF formula.
