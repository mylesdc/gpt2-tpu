During recent epidemics of HFMD in China, medicinal herbals and preparations containing herbal extracts have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy with relative safety profiles. There have been no microbiological studies to validate their usefulness for HFMD. We selected 12 commonly used herbs for HFMD from government recommended guidelines as well as published reports and tested for their antiviral activity and anti-inflammatory activity. A water extract of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HCT) inhibited EV71 infection significantly and was marginally active against CVA16 infection. The IC 50 (concentration to have 50% inhibitory effect) values of HCT against a Fuyang strain and a BrCr strain of EV71 were determined at 8.9 g/mL and 20.6 g/mL, respectively. Mentha haplocalyx Briq. (MHB) water extract was active against CVA16, with an IC 50 value of 70.3 g/mL. The extract did not exhibit activity against EV71 infection. Although the majority of the extracts showed no activity against viral infection, several extracts demonstrated activity in blocking proinflammatory response by viral infection. This study therefore validates the effectiveness of Chinese herbs for HFMD since some formulations containing the correct combination of the herbs can block viral replication as well as proinflammatory response of HFMD.",

To deal with the clinical 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine manifestations characterized with mild fever and rash, practitioners of Chinese medicine reasoned and have effectively treated HFMD as dampness and damp heat. We compiled a list of commonly used herbs with implication for HFMD therapy (Table 1 ) from a list of recommended remedies by government agencies in China and from published reports [7] [8] [9] . Most of the herbs in Table 1 have traditionally or folklorically been used for inflammatory or infective diseases. In addition, most of the herbs listed in Table 1 have not been investigated for their antiviral activity against pathogens of HFMD disease, although some of them have demonstrated antiviral activity.

In brief, two grams of ground specimen was soaked with 30 mL of distilled water at room temperature (RT) for an hour with occasional shaking. Subsequently, the material was warmed up to 65 \u2218 C in a water bath and extracted for 4 hr. The material was extracted one more time, and the pooled liquid fractions were left at RT for overnight to let insoluble materials settle down. Finally, water soluble materials were separated from the insoluble debris by centrifugation (5000 \u00d7g, 15 min). The major chemical components in those extracts were validated following protocols given in Chinese Pharmacopeia (2010 ed.). Those showed that antiviral activities were further studied to validate the presence of characteristic chemicals in the plants following some literatures (e.g., used HPLC profiling for H. cordata and M. haplocalyx). The water extracts were then dried by lyophilization. The lyophilized powders were stored at \u221270 \u2218 C and dissolved in distilled water to make stocks of 20 mg/mL before experiments.",

At up to 1000 g/mL concentrations, all extracts except that from Scutellaria baicalensis showed no cytotoxic effect in Vero cells. Scutellaria baicalensis extract started to show toxic effect at approximately 100 g/mL in Vero cells with an estimated CC 50 value of 240.2 g/mL. To assay for their antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 infection, monolayers of Vero cells were treated with an extract at 1000 g/mL or with Scutellaria baicalensis extract at a nontoxic concentration of 30 g/mL for 2 hr or remained untreated. The cells were then infected with EV71 or CVA16 (MOI = 0.2) for 72 hr. At the end of an infection, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and examined visually for cytopathic effect. Although recommended or widely used for HFMD disease, only three materials showed moderate to strong activity against EV71 or CVA16 infection ( Table 1 ). The extract of Houttuynia cordata significantly blocked the cytopathic effect associated with EV71. The extract did not exhibit significant activity against CVA16 infection. In contrast, MHB treatment significantly blocked the cytopathic effect by CVA16 but not by EV71 infection. An extract from Glycyrrhiza uralensis was reported with strong activity against EV71 infection [22] . We found that the extract was marginally active against EV71 and CVA16 infection. Further studies demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid possessed anti-EV71 activity and anti-CVA16 activity at millimolar concentrations.",

As shown in Figure 1 by approximately 1.8, 3.7, and 5.6 logs in samples treated with HCT at 10, 20, and 40 g/mL, respectively. In comparison, MHB at 50, 100, and 200 g/mL reduced CVA16 production by 1.1, 1.5, and 3.1 logs, respectively (Figure 1(d) ). The effect of drug addition on virus infection was determined at 72 hr PI. As shown in Figure 2 (a), addition of HCT prior to the inoculation or during the inoculation significantly suppressed EV71 infection. The effect became less significant when HCT was added at later time points. In comparison, MHB was effective when used prior to or within the first four hours of inoculation. Again, the effect became less significant when added thereafter. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of virus cell entry is generally a rapid process. The result suggests that HCT likely targets EV71 virus by blocking virus cell attachment or by direct inactivation of infectious virion, whereas MHB potentially targets multiple events of CVA16 infection.",

Several flavonoids like kaempferol [23] and chrysosplenetin [24] have recently been shown with strong antiviral activity against EV71 infection. In a recent study, we also found the flavonoids accounted for the anti-HSV activity of H. cordata [25] . To determine whether the flavonoids were responsible for H. cordata anti-EV71 activity, flavonoid content in HCT was first profiled by HPLC analysis (Figure 3(a) ).

When tested for their antiviral activity against EV71 infection using the flavonoids purchased from a commercial source, the compounds did not display significant activity against EV71 infection (Figure 3(b) ).",

Traditional medicine and the use of herbal medicines for HFMD are also among the recommended approaches for the management of HFMD in China. The effectiveness of herbs against HFMD has not previously been evaluated in a laboratory setting. In this study, we selected 12 herbs from government agency-recommended lists and those of the most commonly prescribed. We focused on their antiviral activity evaluation against EV71 and CVA16 and their activity against proinflammatory response since viral infections tend to be associated with proinflammatory response. EV71 and CVA16 are the two major causative agents causing HFMD. We found that a water extract of Houttuynia cordata has strong activity against EV71 infection, while Mentha haplocalyx has antiviral activity against CVA16. Although most of the herbs from this list showed no activity against viral infection, several extracts demonstrated activity against Figure 6 : The herb extracts inhibit EV71 or CVA16 infection induced proinflammatory response. Vero cells were infected with EV71 (a) or CVA16 (b) at an MOI of 3 in the presence or absence of HCT or MHB at indicated concentrations. The total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol reagent at 16 hr PI. Five hundred nanograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR (upper panels) or by quantitative real-time PCR (lower panels) using primers specific for IL-6 and GAPDH.

The medicinal use of this plant includes its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and febrifuge activities. In a previous study, Lin et al. identified Houttuynia cordata as the only material with activity against EV71 infection among 22 medicinally used herbs from Taiwan. Consistent with the observation by Lin et al. [21] , we also found that the water extract from Houttuynia cordata was active against CVA16, extending the antiviral spectrum of this plant. Unlike other widely used herbs, Houttuynia cordata was recommended for treatment of HFMD with severe syndrome by the Government of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a region with relatively low rate of HFMD incidences and death. Furthermore, the plant contains flavonoids and undecanone. In a preliminary screening study, we failed to detect any antiviral activity with those compounds. Instead, we found that activity was stable against heat and can be extracted out to n-butanol fraction. Further study is warranted to identify the active components from this plant.",
