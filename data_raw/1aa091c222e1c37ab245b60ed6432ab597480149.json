            "text": "Infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks. The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with >99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification. We recommend the use of Expert Determination to determine PHI for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available.",

            "text": "Rapid sequencing and phylodynamic tracking of viral and bacterial isolates have recently become a staple in tracking viral transmission and outbreaks. In the past 5 years, multiple collaborative efforts and wet-lab protocols have been described to obtain clinical materials and sequence whole genomes in hours to days (Carroll et al. 2015; Greninger et al. 2015b; Park et al. 2015; Quick et al. 2016; Kozyreva et al. 2017) . These efforts range from international pandemics and smoldering state/ providence-wide surveillance to local hospital-acquired or ward-based outbreaks (Gardy et al. 2011; Snitkin et al. 2012; Gire et al. 2014; Carroll et al. 2015; Roach et al. 2015; Greninger et al. 2015c; Kozyreva et al. 2016; Naccache et al. 2016 ; Thomson et al. 2016; Greninger et al. 2017b, c; Grubaugh et al. 2017) . The use of genomic data in bacterial food-borne outbreaks has been associated with a faster determination of source and fewer persons associated with each outbreak (Jackson et al. 2016) . Although the need for genomic data from infectious pathogens on a clinical level is limited, it is clear that we are at the beginning of a new age of infectious disease surveillance and response with great interest in 'friction-free' approaches to data sharing (Gardy et al. 2015) . Whereas 5 years ago, there was little to no whole genome sequencing performed in public health laboratories, now more than 4,000 food-borne bacterial isolate genomes are uploaded each month to the Food and Drug Administration GenomeTrakr database by public health laboratories (Allard et al. 2016) . Clinical labs and researchers can digitize stocks of virus at a cost of tens of dollars per isolate, unlocking novel pathogen biology at a local level (Greninger et al. 2015a (Greninger et al. , 2017a Ogimi et al. 2017) . Publicly deposited pathogen genomic data and metadata are forever available and searchable online, cumulatively adding to the world's database of descriptive infectious diseaes epidemiology.",

When depositing a viral or bacterial isolate sample for a clinical or host associated sample, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioSample database requires organism name, strain/isolate name, collection location, collection date, isolation source, host disease, and latitude and longitude, but also allows for deposition of host age, host sex, host health state, host description, and antibiotic resistance metadata among other specimen identifiers (Federhen et al. 2014) . Although privacy concerns for infectious pathogen genomic data and metadata are less than those associated with human genomic data, there are still considerable privacy issues at hand (Lippert et al. 2017) . Naturally, pathogen metadata directly comes from patient metadata. The ability to impute human relations via pathogen genomic data and phylodynamics also raises serious privacy concerns as to what constitutes protected health information (PHI). Because pathogen sequence includes a positive clinical testing result by definition, pathogen metadata can be considered clinical metadata. The desire to build better phylodynamic models creates a demand for increasing amounts of pathogen metadata with higher resolution. Higher resolution of analysis corresponds to greater precision in identifying subjects. In addition, the number of laboratories sequencing isolates, depositing metadata, and participating in phylodynamic analyses is rapidly increasing and many laboratories may not be as aware of potential privacy concerns. Setting standards in this area is now especially critical.",

The correlation between these dates varies by different settings of care, with much higher levels of concordance associated with emergency department (ED) and outpatient care-where >99% of sample collections occurred within 1 day of admission.

We obtained all bacterial and fungal culture test orders for which a positive result/isolate was recovered as well as all viral testing that was ordered and sent to UWMC Microbiology laboratory, HMC Microbiology laboratory, and UW Virology between 1 January 2010 and 2017 (Supplementary Table S1 ).

The data were then quality-controlled by removing all entries that had any empty or nonsensical values for any of the kept metadata (e.g. alphanumeric strings for admission date or unknown patient sex). Chart review of these entries revealed that they were the result of clinical staff competency testing. These entries were subsequently removed from further analysis. We then removed all testing for which the collection date occurred after the discharge date or before the admission date, as all sample collections should be made between an admission date and discharge date for a given clinical encounter. The above quality control steps were decided upon after chart review of select outliers revealed that the above criteria were also highly likely to be associated with reference lab testing; therefore, we also removed all reference lab testing due to inability to confidently assign admission dates to samples sent from outside hospitals. We also quality-controlled the data by examining outliers such as the longest patient stays for ED and outpatient settings. The long patient stay lengths were all valid, and the ED stays were in all cases boarding patients in the ED due to bed unavailability based on chart review.",

The distribution of this subset of viral positives was significantly different compared with all virus testing (D \u00bc 0.373, P \u00bc 4.86e-11). A likely explanation for this phenomena is the increased prevalence of positive samples being collected in the outpatient setting (83.5%) as compared with in the larger dataset (53.1%). These discrepancies can likely be explained by continued monitoring and sampling of patients with chronic viral infections. For example, outpatient clinics may perform routine viral load monitoring in the setting of chronic viral infection.

The emergence of these data creates a pressure for clinical laboratories to share sample metadata, and a demand for community guidance as to the manner in which such clinical metadata can appropriately be shared. Indeed, the question posed here originated from a local decision by our clinical laboratory and IRB to follow the Safe Harbor method of deidentification for samples sequenced in the clinical laboratory and to deposit only year data for sample collection dates (Ogimi et al. 2017) . Practioners can reasonably doubt that a bacterial or viral test result, a genomic sequence, and an associated date constitute PHI. Such data may best be described as a quasi-identifier (Emam, Rodgers, Malin 2015 identification of high-resolution dates from patient information to anonymize such data. Limited datasets that include some date and location information can be disclosed to non-covered entity recipients with an explicit data use agreement (Pace, Staton, Holcomb 2005) . However, publicly available databases such as NCBI Genbank do not meet this standard. Phylodynamic models can be constructed based on full metadata provided to the investigators, and then outbreak dates can be adjusted relative to the start of the outbreak (Greninger et al. 2017b,c) . Although this effectively deals with patient privacy issues, it does not create generalizable models of pathogen evolution nor is it necessarily reproducible by other researchers who do not have access to the full dataset. Since these regulations allow for Expert Determination of whether specific information can be considered identifiable, we encourage clinical laboratories and phylodynamics practioners to take advantage of this avenue for evaluating their studies if they want to upload exact collection date associated with patient care (Sarpatwari et al. 2014) . Explicit patient consent to share such data may also be obtained, although blanket consent forms often include provisions that patient data will be anonymized before release (Greninger et al. 2017d) . Alternatively, the clinical, scientific, and public health communities could determine that the benefits outweight the costs and change regulations around high-resolution sample collection date sharing (Wartenberg and Thompson 2010) .",

            "text": "Our study is limited in that our simple model effectively only uses one or two variables to impute admission date. We sought only to show that PHI was readily imputable from sample collection dates. These results do not indicate whether these patients are in fact identifiable nor how much metadata is required to make them identifiable. Indeed, we did not attempt to use this information to identify actual individuals in this study. Nor have there been many studies on the reidentifiability from admission date, as there have been on date of birth (Golle 2006; Benitez and Malin 2010; Sweeney 2013 ). The answer to these questions often changes over time as increasing amounts of identifiable metadata become available (Liu, Musen, and Chou 2015) . We also did not take into account reference laboratory testing due to inability to confidently ascertain admission dates from outside hospitals. As many clinical laboratories do not run large reference operations, it was unclear what generalizibility these data would offer to other laboratories. Our vantage point is also biased by a focus on the United States clinical testing and HIPAA Privacy Rule. Most recent phylodynamic analysis has been performed outside the United States where rules associated with patient data privacy may be interepreted differently (Faria et al. 2016) . Indeed, assuming a predictable evolutionary rate for a given pathogen, one may be able to use phylodynamic modeling accurately impute the collection dates from samples where data was obscured to comply with local privacy and IRB requirements (Dudas et al. 2017) .",

Metadata deposition into large centralized databases for research purposes is one of a host of ethical issues associated with communicating patient data and metadata. Although academic journals increasingly require direct patient consent to publish case reports, pathologists are encouraged to post interesting histopathology, gross tissue, or laboratory medicine (e.g. Gram stain, blood smear) images on social media to enhance their own personal brand as well as that of a profession that is often found in the hospital basement (Crane and Gardner 2016; Brissette et al. 2017; Isom, Walsh, and Gardner 2017) . Phylodynamic metadata is but one among many ethical issues and questions facing the clinical laboratory today. Figure 3 . Higher concordance of collection date and admission date for females than for males. Cumulative probability curves of the collection date being within X days of the admission date are shown for all locations and sexes grouped by the test type -all tests combined (A), bacterial/fungal culture positives (B), all viral testing (C). Samples from women were significantly more likely to be collected on the exact admission date (73.7 versus 63.9%, P \u00bc 2.2e-16) and closer to the admission date (D \u00bc 0.089916, P \u00bc 0.0137) than those from men.",
