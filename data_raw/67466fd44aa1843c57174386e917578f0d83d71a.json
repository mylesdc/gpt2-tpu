This epidemic had caused 185 laboratory-confirmed cases and 36 deaths in the Republic of Korea until September 2, 2015, which attracted public's attention. Based on the detailed data of patients released by World Health Organization (WHO) and actual propagation of the epidemic, we construct two dynamical models to simulate the propagation processes from May 20 to June 8 and from June 9 to July 10, 2015, respectively and find that the basic reproduction number R 0 reaches up to 4.422. The numerical analysis shows that the reasons of the outbreak spread quickly are lack of self-protection sense and targeted control measures. Through partial correction analysis, the parameters \u03b2 1 and \u03b3 have strong correlations with R 0 , i.e., the infectivity and proportion of the asymptomatic infected cases have much influence on the spread of disease. By sensitivity analysis, strengthening self-protection ability of susceptible and quickly isolating or monitoring close contacts are effective measures to control the disease.",

A total of 1,413 laboratory-confirmed cases infected by MERS-CoV, including 502 deaths, had been reported globally as of August 19, 2015 [5] , and mortality rate was about 35% [6] . Most cases emerged in the Middle East, sporadic cases had been reported in UK, Italy, France, Spain, United States and so on [7] [8] [9] [10] . Most of these cases were confirmed after a traveling in Middle East. In the Republic of Korea, the first case was an import one having a traveling experience in Middle East [8, 11] . Due to poor pre-control measures, the number of additional confirmed cases gradually increased during the period from May 20, 2015 to June 8, 2015 . Then the Korean Government took effective control measures and the number of additional confirmed cases gradually decreased during the period from June 9 to July 4 [12, 13] . Therefore, the Korean Government and WHO announced the end of MERS epidemic in the Republic of Korea in the middle of July.",

The most probable source of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is bats, and MERS-CoV-related viruses have been detected in bats. However, people have little chance to contact with them directly. It is generally considered that dromedary camels are the intermediate reservoirs for MERS-CoV transmission from bats to human, but the accurate role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV has not been available [1, 10, 14, 15] . Generally, there are two main transmission routes [4, 8, [16] [17] [18] : one is animal-to-human transmission, the other one is human-to-human transmission. The MERS-CoV can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The patients infected by MERS-CoV will have symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, and the severe patients may have renal failure [1, 6, 7, 14, 19] . However, humans do not immediately show clinical symptoms after being infected and they undergo a incubation period from 2 to 14 days, during which time they are not infectious [11, 16] .",

It is necessary to have a look at how the epidemic emerged and developed in the Republic of Korea [8, 20, 21] . The first laboratory-confirmed patient was reported on May 20, 2015. He is a 68 year-old male who had traveled in several countries in Middle East before flying back to the Republic of Korea on May 4. Until May 11 he showed symptoms and sought for three hospitals before he was finally confirmed and isolated. During the period from being infected to being confirmed he had a close contact with many visitors, relatives, inpatients and health care workers. The new cases continued to be reported in the next few days, and they all had corrections with the first confirmed case. Through analyzing the actual transmission process, several factors appear to have contributed to the initial spread of this virus [22] :",

As of August 25, 2015, a total number of 16,693 cases were isolated or monitored [25] . Based on this situation we establish a dynamical Model (3) with control measures as follows: where d 1 , d 2 , d 3 and d 4 are isolation or monitoring rates in E, A, I and H compartment, respectively. l 1 , l 2 and l 3 are self-protection coefficients with asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases and hospitalized cases, respectively.",

When R 0 > 1, the disease will spread in the population; when R 0 < 1, the disease will gradually disappear [18, 29, 31] . So it is important to study the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of basic reproduction number R 0 on crucial parameters. Here we adopt Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to study the correlation between five crucial parameters (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 , \u03b3, \u03bb) and R 0 to asses the effect of corresponding control measures. Randomly choosing 1000 samples of the five crucial parameters (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 , \u03b3, \u03bb), which follow a normal distribution. Based on the 1000 samples, we perform the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis through rank correlation coefficient(PRCC), there is such a relationship: the bigger the absolute value of PRCC, the stronger the correlation between the chosen parameter and R 0 . From Table 3 , it is easy to find that the absolute value of PRCC between \u03b2 1 and R 0 is biggest, which shows that \u03b2 1 is the most important in determining R 0 . It also indicates that the key factor of the rapid spread of the epidemic in the early stage is no timely isolating close contacts with the patients. The parameter \u03bb has a negative correction with R 0 , i.e., when shorting the time from the onset to hospitalization, the value of R 0 will decrease.",

We assume that d 1 , d 2 , d 3 and d 4 are the same, and the fitting curve is shown in Fig 4. Substituting parameter values into the expression of R c (see S1 File), and get R c = 0.385 which is less than one, this also illustrates that MERS epidemic in the Republic of Korea will eventually disappear, which is consistent with the actual situation that there is no additional confirmed cases form July 5, 2015.

The region on the left of the red line represents R c < 1. The region on the right of the red line represents R c > 1. In Fig 6, it shows the change of R c with respect to d 1 , d 2 , d 3 and d 4 , respectively. It is also easy to notice that when the isolating or monitoring rate increases, the basic reproduction number R c will reduce, where d 1 and d 2 have a bigger influence on R c than d 3 and d 4 . It tells us that quickly finding and isolating exposed and asymptomatic cases can effectively control the spread of epidemic.",

The parameters l 1 and \u03b2 1 have a bigger influence on the final size of accumulated confirmed cases, and this is consistent with the sensitivity analysis results of R 0 .

When the novel disease emerged, there were no effective control measures for many reasons, in this case the basic reproduction number R 0 = 4.42, i.e., the epidemic spread quickly. Since South Korean Government isolated or monitored all the close contacts with the patients infected by MERS-CoV, the additional confirmed cases gradually reduced and epidemic was controlled quickly. At this moment, R c = 0.385. After July 5, there is no additional confirmed cases reported anymore. (1) and (3), it comes to a consistent conclusion through the sensitivity of the basic reproduction and the final size of accumulated confirmed cases: isolating all the close contacts and strengthening the self-protection ability of susceptible are the most effective control measures.",
