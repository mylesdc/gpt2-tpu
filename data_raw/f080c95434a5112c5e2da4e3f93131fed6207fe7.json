Viral loads were equal in EM and IM but dropped markedly in LM fish. Gene expression analyses using a 1.8 K salmonid fish cDNA microarray (SFA2.0) and real-time qPCR revealed a large group of genes highly up-regulated across tissues in EM, which were mainly implicated in innate antiviral responses and cellular stress. Despite equal levels of MHC class I in EM and LM, increase of splenic and cardiac expression of immunoglobulin-like genes was found only in LM while a suite of adaptive immunity markers were activated already in IM. The hepatic responses to ISAV were characterized by difference between EM and LM in expression of chaperones and genes involved in eicosanoid metabolism. To develop classification of high and low resistance phenotypes based on a small number of genes, we processed results from qPCR analyses of liver using a linear discriminant analysis. Four genes (5-lipoxygenase activating protein, cytochrome P450 2K4-1, galectin-9 and annexin A1) were sufficient for correct assignment of individuals to EM, LM and uninfected groups, while IM was inseparable from EM. Three of four prognostic markers are involved in metabolism of inflammatory regulators.",

            "text": "Infectious salmon anemia has since the early 1990's been one of the most dangerous viral diseases threatening Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry. The infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus assigned to the genus Isavirus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. It mainly infects endothelial cells and leukocytes and causes a multisystemic disease characterized by high mortality with exophthalmia, pale gills, ascites, hemorrhagic liver necrosis, renal interstitial hemorrhage and tubular nephrosis (reviewed in [1, 2] ). Several ISAV strains with different pathogenicity are known and were recently categorized according to the genotype in the high polymorphic region of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene and the ability to induce acute versus protracted disease [3, 4] . The fact that the virus' receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) lacks activity in Atlantic salmon is thought to have an important role in mediating the severe clinical manifestations of infection (e.g. hemagglutination and anemia) [5, 6] . Nonetheless, host factors must make a significant contribution to the outcome of infection since high variation in susceptibility and resistance to ISAV has been observed. Survival during natural and experimental infections by any particular virus isolate can range from 0-100% and varies significantly between families (R. Stigum Olsen, pers. comm.). The presence of a genetic component for disease resistance is strong evidence for the existence of protective antiviral responses, however potential molecular mechanisms that may account for protection against ISAV are unknown. Association between specific MHCI alleles and survival has been shown [7] , which imply that a collection of multiple host factors may explain disease resistance. Although far from completely resolved, it seems that type 1 interferon (IFN) does not confer antiviral protection; this might be related to virus-antagonistic mechanisms [8, 9] . There is also evidence that humoral immunity mounted by antibody responses is less important for survival [4] . Early studies also suggested that initial activation of T cells, but not B cells, and suppression of immune function caused by leukopenia is a general result of infection independent of anemia [10] . Collectively, these results imply that optimal constellation of multiple host factors are explaining disease resistance. This is also supported by the fact that low progression is achieved when breeding for ISAV resistance (R. Stigum Olsen, pers. comm.) and that only weak effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for this trait have been found (T. Moen, pers. comm.).",

At present selective breeding and vaccination are key approaches to disease control, which employ respectively the innate and acquired protective mechanisms. Innate defence involves generalized antivi-ral responses, such as IFN and IFN-independent proteins and pathogen-specific antiviral factors referred to as restriction factors [11, 12] . Adaptive immunity in turn includes humoral and cellular components which interact with a complex network of immune factors. Assessment of the relative roles of these mechanisms is vital for the development of efficient disease control strategies. Furthermore, today's selective breeding for disease resistance is hampered by a lack of predictive methods. Pathogen challenge enables identification of the most resistant individuals; however, infected fish may become carriers of pathogens and therefore cannot be returned to the farming environment. Thus, the development of methods for the prediction of resistance requires a better understanding of the protective host mechanisms.",

Survival time is commonly used as an estimate of susceptibility and resistance in pathogen challenge tests. Atlantic salmon were infected with a common acute ISAV isolate by cohabitance, which mimics the natural mode of virus transfer. Tissues from fish within early (EM), intermediate (IM) and late mortality (LM) groups were sampled and viral loads were determined by real-time qPCR. We used a high-density salmonid fish cDNA microarray (SFA2.0 immunochip) designed for studies of responses to pathogens and stressors (GEO GPL1212) [13, 14] . In comparison with previous versions, the updated 1.8 K platform (GEO GPL6154) has a substantially improved coverage of immune genes. The microarray analyses were conducted using EM and LM fish, and since the roles of tissues were not known we began with individual-pooled samples (n = 6) of gill, heart, spleen and liver. Next, individual analysis on liver samples (n = 6) was performed to find prognostic markers, since liver had the highest number of differentially expressed genes. The results of microarray analyses indicated possible molecular determinants of resistance, and to corroborate these conclusions, real-time qPCR analysis of genes selected by their functional roles and expression profiles were performed on individual samples (n = 4/n = 6). For this analysis we also included a number of genes being markers of adaptive immunity that were not present on the microarray platform. The development of predictors began with individual microarray comparisons using the liver tissue. Given high costs of microarray analyses it is customary to develop tests based on real-time qPCR trying to minimize the numbers of prognostic genes. We analyzed expression of the candidate genes and used linear discriminant analysis for the classification of samples.",

A cumulative mortality (CM) of 84% in the cohabitant fish confirms the highly pathogenic nature of this ISAV strain (Fig. 1) . By termination 49 days post-infection (DPI) mortality rate had reached a plateau phase, but if continued mortality would likely have approached 100% (see virus load in section below).

The src-type tyrosine kinase Jak and signal transducer/activator of transcription Stat1 play a key part in induction of IFN-dependent genes [18, 19] . Up-regulation of interferon induced protein 44 and doublestranded RNA-adenosine deaminase (ADAR-1), one of the key antiviral effectors, was additional evidence for activation of the IFN-axis. Similar profiles were seen in srcrelated tyrosine-protein kinase FRK and ligand for Lck SH2 domain p62 which regulate various immune responses, being involved in a complex network of signal transduction pathways. Further downstream, up-regulation of several IFN-responsive genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (\u03b22 m encoding MHCI light chain, tapasin, proteasome activator complex, ubiquitin, cathepsins) indicated an early activation of adaptive immunity in EM. Broad induction of GADD45-\u03b2 and -\u03b3 could contribute to increased survival of immune cells through interaction with NF-\u03baB pathway [20, 21] . Further evidence for early immune cell activation was increased leukocyte migration and recruitment (up-regulation of chemokines and receptors; SCYA110-2/CCL7-like, SCYA106/CCL21-like, CXCR4-like) and monocyte and lymphocyte maturation and activation (up-regulation of regulator of G-protein signalling/RGS1, Fc-gamma receptor/CD64, TNFR5/CD40, LECT2). A number of EMinduced genes could be involved in other functions along with antiviral defense; galectins are small, highly conserved proteins that bind sugars and other ligands and can work as both positive and negative regulators of various immune functions [22, 23] . Coordinated regulation of galectins and interferons was reported in mammals [24, 25] .",

Microarray anal- yses of heart, spleen and gills revealed a coordinated induction of Ig-related genes (Fig. 5) . A gene similar to CD179\u03b2 (Ig-kappa chain V-I; see Additional file 1) encodes a receptor found on the surface of pre-and pro-B cells involved in signal transduction and differentiation, allelic exclusion at the Ig heavy chain locus, and promotion of Ig light chain gene rearrangements [26] . Functionally related were also two other similarly induced transcripts of the IgM heavy chain (Ig-mu heavy chain disease protein and Ig-mu chain C region membranebound). The CD84 leukocyte antigen is also interesting in this context, being highly expressed in certain B-cell subsets and belonging to the recently discovered family of signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM)-related receptors (SRR), a group of surface molecules whose main function seems to be the fine-tuning of lymphocyte responses [27] . Among this class of LM induced genes were also five Ig-kappa genes involved in B-cell receptor (CD79\u03b1/\u03b2) signalling (Ig-kappa chains V-IV region B17-1+2, V-III region VG, V-IV region JI and V-IV region Len). Collectively, the expression profiles of these genes indicated that a general activation of B-lymphocyte maturation and humoral immunity occurred among the late survivors. However, the gene homologous to the B-cell receptor itself was unregulated or down-regulated in spleen together with some B-cell regulatory genes. Notably, MHC class II (\u03b1-and invariant chain Il), which is the mediator of Ag-presentation in B-cells (and other APCs), was also down-regulated in spleen at both EM and LM stages, but was induced in heart of LM but not EM.",

For this analysis we also included fish in the IM stage and increased the number of individuals (6 per stage) to see if the viral clearance observed in LM was explained by a general activation of adaptive immunity in IM. The results showed that IgM and IgZ, but not IgD (data not shown), were induced at all stages versus control but in opposite manners (Fig. 6 ). IgM mRNA peaked at EM and declined towards the later stages (IM and LM) while IgZ was steadily induced towards peak levels at LM. Kinetics of IgM expression was similar to CD4 and TGF-\u03b2.",

It must be noted that the significance of the data varied due to individual variation, but all qPCRs were replicated three times in both the reverse transcription step and in PCR, giving identical results. Thus, the pronounced reduction in virus load from IM to LM might be explained by both developing antibody responses (IgZ) and activation of T-cell mediated immunity at IM, either through a specific CD8 + cytotoxic and/or T H 1 response. Notably, this activation corresponded with induced antigen presentation, e.g. a broad elevation of MHCI mRNA levels across all tissues.

We wished to try a hypothesis-free strategy meaning that gene expression profiles were used with no surmise on gene functions. Therefore the candidate genes (Table 3) were chosen exclusively by their expression profiles (differences between EM and LM). Six individual liver samples from each of EM and LM stages were used as a training set in a linear discriminant analysis. For this analysis a function was constructed which took positive values in EM and negative values in LM while intercept with X-axis marked a boundary between these groups (Fig. 7) . Furthermore, the classifier was verified in an independent test set, which included fish from all stages and controls. The uninfected fish were well separated from the challenged, and as expected, the values of predictor function were negative as well as in LM. The individuals from EM and LM were all assigned to the correct classes. Fish with early mortality formed a sharply outlined group however IM was not separated from LM. The genes were ranked by Wilks' coefficients. To evaluate the minimum number of genes required for the correct class assignment we used forward and reverse procedures. The genes were either added or deleted one by one starting with respectively highest and lowest ranks, the predictor function was re-calculated and the results were compared to those shown in Fig. 7 . In both cases, four genes (5lipoxygenase activating protein, cytochrome P450 2K4, galectin-9 and annexin A1) were determined as the minimum number required to build the function that ensured robust class prediction. These genes changed expression in different directions (Table 2 ) and interestingly, three of four genes were related to metabolism of eicosanoids which are inflammatory regulators of lipid origin.",

This question is of great importance for the development of protective strategies in aquaculture. With the exception of one study that reported possible association of specific MHC class I alleles with survival [7] there is no evidence in the literature of defensive/offensive responses that could underlie individual variation resistance to ISAV. An advantage of research on infectious diseases in fish is the possibility to challenge large numbers of individuals and to locate groups with markedly different performance. Survival time is commonly used as a simple measure of resistance based on the assumption that it is determined principally by antiviral defense and/or severity of the pathological alterations. One cannot neglect the possibility that differences in survival times are largely stochastic by nature. Then given similar physiological conditions (all fish were sampled in a moribund state) we could expect comparable phenotypes in the groups with differ- ent survival times; however our studies revealed marked differences between the study groups (stages). Survival time can depend on the level of infection determined by the probability and time-point of encounter with pathogens and/or with active or passive protective mechanisms.",

The viral loads were remarkably lower in LM however we did not find significant difference between EM and IM (except for liver). Therefore viral load was an important, but not the only factor, influencing survival times. Dramatic activation of the innate immune responses in EM fish was a notable and intriguing finding. Such responses were observed at different cellular levels with possible affects on the binding of ligands, perception and transduction of signals, regulation of gene expression and antiviral effectors. Importantly, many genes with significantly higher expression levels in EM are known to be IFN-dependent and as expected these responses were characterised by low tissue specificity. Our result was in line with a recent finding that induction of type I IFN and IFN-dependent genes in ISAV infected fish and cells did not provide protection against virus [8, 39] . In addition, knowledge is emerging on potential IFN-antagonistic mechanisms of ISAV's NS1 protein [9] , which is well-known from influenza [40] . We do not know whether strong antiviral responses were detrimental to fish. Such a possibility cannot be excluded, however, it is likely that activity of the IFN axis was directly related to the viral load (which was greater in EM). Induction of galectins was a striking feature of the early broad tissue responses to ISAV. Regulation of these genes with IFN was reported in higher vertebrates [24, 25] and recently in trout macrophages [41] . It is known that galectins can be used by virus [42] . However, strong responses in phylogenetically remote species (fish and mammals) to diverse viruses such as ISAV in salmon and rhabdovirus (VHSV) in trout [43] make such a possibility very unlikely. Proteins with ability to bind diverse ligands can work as factors that restrict the propagation of the virus. Studies on these mechanisms, which unlike the generalized antiviral responses appear more pathogen-specific, represent a rapidly emerging area. Probably the best known achievement is identification of tripartite motif proteins and cyclophilin A, that may account for interspecific differences in resistance to HIV [12] . Interestingly, we observed up-regulation of ring finger/tripartite motif protein and cyclophilins, but without association to increased survival. We cannot reject the potential variation in the ability to restrict propagation of ISAV. To assess this possibility it will be necessary to screen for viral loads in a large number of challenged individuals, preferably from families with markedly different resistance. Overall, Test set",

Regulation of heat shock proteins plus other chaperones regarded as evidence for cellular stress, is a common feature of various viral diseases [44] . These chaperones changed expression in both directions, however levels in LM were consistently lower than in EM. We could also see evidence for less severe inflammatory responses in LM. While many inflammatory regulators showed similar profiles at all stages, there was a difference in expression of genes involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, which have been found to play an important part in pathogenesis of many viral diseases [33] . Importantly, two genes induced in LM (5-lipoxygenase activating protein and annexin A1) were identified as the most valuable markers for the discrimination of groups with different survival times. Both genes encode for proteins associated with phospholipase A2 and are regarded as important targets for anti-inflammatory therapy [45, 46] . Annexin AI inhibits phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid from cellular membranes. Arachidonic acid is subsequently transformed to prostaglandins, thromboxane and leukotrienes collectively termed eicosanoids (reviewed in [47] ) and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein plays a key part in one of these pathways. Differences between EM and LM were seen in several more genes of eicosanoid metabolism while prostaglandin D synthase was equally down-regulated in both groups.",

            "text": "Microarray analyses revealed only one group of genes (immunoglobulin-related) that were higher induced in LM compared to EM. Changes in levels of these transcripts could be due to maturation and/or migration of immune cells to the heart and spleen, the two most heavily infected organs, and suggested an activation of adaptive immune responses in late survivors. The microarray includes eleven Ig clones corresponding to seven Unigene clusters. The exact roles of these salmon genes are not known, however their putative mammalian homologs are involved in early B-cell development. Apart from mediating antibody responses, mature B cells are crucial for activation of effector helper T cells [48] . Equally important was the fact that induction of these Igs correlated with a viral clearance among LM fish. This prompted an extended qPCR analysis including all arms of adaptive cellular immunity, and showed that the expression kinetics of IgM, -D and -Z heavy chains, the most likely mediators of antibody responses in salmon, were quite different. The reason for this is at best speculative, but it could indicate different roles for IgM and IgZ in salmonid immunity (e.g. innate natural versus humoral neutralizing antibodies). Perhaps more interesting was the induction of CD8\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, but not TGF-\u03b2 (T H 2 marker), in IM and LM fish which correlated with viral clearance in LM fish. An optimal T H 1 response, consisting of virus-specific (IFN-\u03b3)secreting CD4 + T cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells that lyse virus-infected cells [49] , is crucial for clearance of influenza virus infection in humans [50] . Further strengthening the significance of a cytotoxic response was the fact that MHC class I, the key activator of CD8 + T cells, was consistently induced in all tissues and stages. These results also support recent observations that ISAV survival corre-lated more strongly to the level of cell-mediated responses than did humoral responses [4] .",

An ideal strategy for prediction of resistance would be an in vitro test, such as stimulation of primary cultures (e.g. peripheral blood cells) with ISAV and subsequent gene expression analysis. However because we did not find any broad-tissue responses associated with improved resistance the feasibility of such approach is ambiguous. The LM group was characterized by activation of adaptive immune responses which are systemic by nature and require complex interactions of different cellular elements and humoral factors. Given the pivotal role of acquired responses, the development of animal models will be essential for studies on fish resistance to viral pathogens.

The slides were pretreated with 1% BSA fraction V, 5 \u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50\u00b0C and washed with 2 \u00d7 SSC for 3 min and 0.2 \u00d7 SSC for 3 min at room temperature and hybridized overnight at 60\u00b0C in a cocktail containing 1.3 \u00d7 Denhardt's, 3 \u00d7 SSC, 0.3% SDS, 0.67 \u00b5g \u00b5l -1 polyadenylate and 1.4 \u00b5g \u00b5l -1 yeast tRNA. After hybridization slides were washed at room temperature in 0.5 \u00d7 SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min, 0.5 \u00d7 SSC and 0.01% SDS for 15 min, and twice in 0.06 \u00d7 SSC for 2 and 1 min, respectively. Scanning was performed with GSI Lumonics ScanArray 4000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium) and images were processed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Axon, Union City, CA, USA). The spots were filtered by criterion (I-B)/(S I +S B ) \u2265 0.6, where I and B are the mean signal and background intensities and S I , S B are the standard deviations. The low quality spots were excluded from analysis and genes presented with less than three high quality spots on a slide were discarded. After subtraction of median background from median signal intensities, the expression ratios (ER) were calculated. Lowess normalization was performed first for the whole slide and next for twelve rows and four columns per slide. The differential",

To avoid genomic DNA amplification, amplicons were when possible placed over introns and product size and specificity were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis (Tm calling; LightCycler 480, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). PCR efficiency (E) was determined from tenfold serial dilutions of cDNA for each primer pair and calculated according to Rasmussen [53] . Each pair of primers was tested on different samples in the same plate to ensure optimal reproducibility and repeated testing was performed on whole template setup or a random selection of samples to ensure interassay reproducibility. As common reference gene 18S rRNA was used, which was previously optimised and validated [54] . Four potential reference genes were tested (18S rRNA, EF-1alpha and two other non-regulated genes from the microarray results; SEC13-related protein and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19 kDa subunit) using the BestKeeper [55] and GeNorm [56] software, however only 18S rRNA met qualifications of stability. PCR assays were optimized using 2 \u00d7 SYBR \u00ae Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) and varying amounts of cDNA and primer concentrations. Optimal PCR conditions in a 12 \u00b5l reaction volume were 3 \u00b5l 1:10 diluted cDNA for all assays (1:2000 for 18S rRNA). Primer concentrations were 0.4-0.6 \u00b5M. PCR was performed in duplicates (triplicates for E-curves) in 96-well optical plates on LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics). Running conditions were 5-10 min pre-incubation following 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 sec, 60\u00b0C for 15 sec, 72\u00b0C for 15 sec. Cycle threshold (C T ) values were calculated using both the fit points and second derivative methods (Roche Diagnostics), with respective rejection of C T values above 37 and 35. Relative expression of mRNA was calculated using the \u2206\u2206C T method adjusted for E. Statistics was calculated using Unistat version 5.5 (Unistat, London, UK). Difference between groups was analyzed with ANOVA with subsequent Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.05). The design of analyses and numbers of samples are indicated in Table 3 .",
