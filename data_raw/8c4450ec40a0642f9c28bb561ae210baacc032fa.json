Macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it. MERS-CoV infects cells via its Spike (S) glycoprotein that binds on Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor present on macrophages. Whether this Spike/DPP4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. Herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 in naive and LPS-activated THP-1 macrophages and augmented LPS-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of TLR signaling IRAK-M as well as of the transcriptional repressor PPAR\u03b3. Inhibition of DPP4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or siRNA abrogated the effects of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein on IRAK-M, PPAR\u03b3 and IL-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by DPP4 receptor. The effect was observed both in THP-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. These findings support a DPP4-mediated suppressive action of MERS-CoV in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.",

MERS-CoV was identified in humans for the first time in 2012, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [1] and as of June 2015, more than 1,330 cases and 475 associated deaths had been confirmed (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_ infections/archive_updates/en) [2] . A single exported case with travel history in the Middle East has resulted in an ongoing outbreak in the Republic of Korea, while MERS-CoV cases have also been detected in Europe, USA, Asia and Africa. Clinical features of MERS-CoV infection vary from asymptomatic cases to severe lower respiratory tract infection, shock, multiorgan failure which may lead to death [3, 4] . The virus can spread from person-to-person [5] although the rate of transmission appears to be low [6, 7] , probably due to the low percentage of respiratory",

            "text": "Among the major structural components [1, 9] , the spike (S) glycoprotein expressed by MERS-CoV (reviewed in [10] ) plays an important role in both viral attachment and entry into the target cell [11] . MERS-CoV S glycoprotein contains 1,353 amino acids and appears as a trimer on the viral membrane surface. The precursor S protein can be cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP4) while the subunit S2 consists of a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two hep-tad repeat regions, termed heptad repeats 1 and 2 and mediates membrane fusion [11] [12] [13] [14] . MERS-CoV infection is mediated by the binding of viral S glycoprotein to its cognate receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) [11, 15] . DPP4 is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein which is widely expressed on non ciliated bronchial epithelium and in macrophages [12, 16] . Determinants of host range and cellular tropism are located in the RBD region of the S glycoprotein while crystal structure modelling have revealed the amino acid residues in DPP4 receptor which are critically implicated in the S glycoprotein-DPP4 binding [12, 17, 18] . DPP4 receptor is present on different cell types that are infected by the virus, including macrophages. Whether interaction of the S glycoprotein with DPP4 alters macrophage responses remains unknown.",

Lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein carrying the D510A mutation on the S protein that inhibits its association with its receptor DPP4 were also generated to be used as a negative control. Expression of MERS CoV S protein in supernatants was confirmed by western blot ( Figure 1A left panel). Supernatants collected from transfected cells were used after normalization to HIV-1 p24 protein, to infect THP-1 cells or primary monocytes in subsequent experiments. To confirm the presence of the virus and its infectivity, infected cells were harvested, lysed and luciferase activity was measured in the protein lysates ( Figure 1A , right panel). The significantly increased viral entry of the viral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV expressing wild-type Spike glycoprotein compared to the D510A mutant Spike protein [17] was successfully confirmed. The pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-pseudotyped with the NL4-3 envelope successfully entered the target cells as previously described [25, 26] . THP1 monocytes expressed DPP4 the levels of which were increased upon differentiation to macrophages by PMA, the ligand of S glycoprotein, while LPS treatment did not affect DPP4 levels in THP1 macrophages (Supplematary Figure S1 ). THP-1 macrophages, as derived following PMA treatment, were infected with lentiviral particles carrying the wild-type (WT S) or the mutant (D510A) MERS-CoV S protein or were mockinfected. Twenty-four hours post infection, cells were stimulated with LPS and the levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were measured. Exposure of THP-1 macrophages to lentiviral particles expressing the MERS CoV S protein resulted in suppression of LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 production ( Figure 1C, 1E) . The wild-type MERS-CoV S protein also suppressed basal TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production from THP-1 macrophages ( Figure 1B, 1D) , even though the levels of IL-6 were approaching the detection limit of the assay. We further assessed whether lentiviral particles expressing the MERS-CoV S protein affect macrophage survival and proliferation.

Normalized supernatants were used to infect THP-1 cells and infection was monitored by luciferase assay. The C9-tagged MERS-CoV Spike glycoprotein was detected by Western blot in purified lentiviral particles. HIV-1 p24 envelope protein was used as a normalizing control for the semi-quantitative analysis of MERS-CoV S protein among different types of pseudotyped viruses. THP-1 macrophages were infected with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS wild type (wt) or the D510 mutant S glycoprotein (D510A) of MERS-CoV, or left uninfected (mock), and were stimulated with LPS. TNF\u03b1 was measured in the supernatants at the na\u00efve state B. and following LPS stimulation C.

            "text": "MERS-CoV infection is associated with severe ARDS and increased mortality of infected individuals. It infects several cell types including immune cells, utilizing DPP4/CD26 as receptor, a receptor present in most immune cells including macrophages. MERS-CoV infection alters both innate and adaptive immune responses. In the present study, we demonstrated that the DPP4-binding protein of MERS-CoV, the S glycoprotein, altered macrophage responses rendering them hyporesponsive to TLR4 stimulation. This finding indicates that interaction of MERS-CoV S protein with DPP4 initiates signals that suppress macrophage activation supporting an immunomodulatory mechanism of MERS-CoV that may Recent evidence have shown that infection of human T-cells with MERS-CoV results in suppression of immune responses by inducing both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways [19] , providing a potential mechanism for the enhanced pathogenicity of the virus. The same group has shown that macrophages can also be infected by MERS-CoV and in this case infection with the virus induces the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IFN\u03b3 and IL-12, thus initiating anti-viral responses [24] and additional evidence showed increased IFN\u03bb, and several chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and IL-8 production from macrophages or dendritic cells, in the absence [27, 28] or presence [24, 29] of viral replication. Our findings showed that the MERS-CoV S protein did not induce the production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 but was rather capable of suppressing their induction by LPS. This suggests that the induction of these factors observed in earlier studies was due to the active replication of the virus observed, since in that case macrophages were infected with an active virus [24] . Indeed, the induction of the negative regulators of macrophage activation IRAK-M and PPAR\u03b3 occurred 24 hours following exposure to MERS-CoV S protein, suggesting that the virus may exert a pro-inflammatory action at the early stages of infection followed by a state of reduced responsiveness to pro-inflammatory stimuli. This effect was also observed in primary human monocytes, where IRAK-M was induced at both mRNA and protein levels while PPAR\u03b3 induction was observed only at the protein level, potentially due to the heterogeneity of PBMCs, which may mask the effect.",

Our findings demonstrate suppression of TNF\u03b1 production not only upon LPS stimulation but also at basal levels in THP1 macrophages and primary human monocytes, supporting that MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced a mechanism that affects not only TLR signals but also alternative pathways that control cytokine production. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein also induced the expression of IL-10 from LPS-activated macrophages, supporting an additional mechanism for suppressing immune responses. Thus, our findings support that signaling initiated by MERS-CoV S protein through DPP4 renders macrophages hypo-responsive to activation signals, promoting immune suppression in cells where the virus does not actively proliferate. As a result, suppression of macrophage responses allows viral propagation and suppresses the capacity of the host to respond to the same or other opportunistic infections, thus contributing to the increased mortality of MERS-CoV infected patients.",

Proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing Sodium-Dodecyl Sulphate, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein protein as expressed by the pcDNA3.1+ vector is tagged with C9 tag (TETSQVAPA) and thus the anti-C9 antibody [aE11] (ab90801, Abnova) was used for the detection of the protein. In the context of pseudoviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV expressing Spike glycoportein, the migration pattern of the S viral protein presents two major bands; a high molecular weight band of approximately 190 KDa and a low molecular weight band of 80 KDa, accompanied by a faint band of ~100 KDa as previously described [41] . For the detection of PPARg and IRAK-M, primary antibodies (anti-PPAR\u03b3 (E-8):sc-7223, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-IRAK-M (ab-8116-Abcam) were incubated with membrane overnight at 4 o C, washed with PBST (0.1%Tween) and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature.
