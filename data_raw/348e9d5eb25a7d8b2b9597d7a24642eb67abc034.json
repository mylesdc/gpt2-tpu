This review summarises the evidence for the empirical antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children and puts emphasis on publications since the release of the previous WHO Evidence Summary report published in 2014. Methods: A systematic search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia was conducted between 1 January 2013 and 10 November 2016. Results: The optimal dosing recommendation for amoxicillin remains unclear with limited pharmacological and clinical evidence. There is limited evidence from surveillance to indicate whether amoxicillin or broader spectrum antibiotics (e.g. third-generation cephalosporins) are being used most commonly for paediatric CAP in different WHO regions. Data are lacking on clinical efficacy in the context of pneumococcal, staphylococcal and mycoplasma disease and the relative contributions of varying first-line and step-down options to the selection of such resistance. Conclusion: Further pragmatic trials are required to optimise management of hospitalised children with severe and very severe pneumonia.",

Nearly, 1 in 500 children under the age of 5 years is hospitalised each year with CAP [2] . However, only 54% of children with symptoms of pneumonia are taken outside the home for care [3] . Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1] . There are signs of progress in the 75 countries included in 'Countdown to 2015' [3] . In this group, the number of deaths from pneumonia in children under 5 has declined from 21% in 2000 to 16% in 2015 [3] .

Since both fast-breathing and chest-indrawing pneumonias were now best treated with amoxicillin, classifications were also revised. The new classification was revised to include only two categories of pneumonia: 'pneumonia' with fast breathing and/or chest indrawing, which requires home therapy with oral amoxicillin, and 'severe pneumonia' , pneumonia with any general danger sign, which requires referral and injectable antibiotic therapy.",

It is responsible for about one-third of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children aged <2 years. S. pneumoniae is commonly found in asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage. The asymptomatic carriage state is responsible for much of the transmission within populations, such as day-care centres [4] . Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a major pathogen, though proportions vary regionally and with vaccine coverage [5] . Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae is considered an atypical bacterial pneumonia because of its different course, radiological findings and treatment. Active population-based surveillance for CAP was undertaken in hospitals in three American cities [6] . The annual incidence of hospitalisation for pneumonia was 15.7 cases per 10,000 children (95% CI 14.9-16.5). The annual incidence of M. pneumoniae was 1.4/10,000 (95% CI 1.2-1.6) and of S. pneumoniae was 0.5/10,000 (95% CI 0.4-0.6) [6] . Less commonly, severe infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, especially following influenza. Fungal infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJP) is particularly important in young children with AIDS. Furthermore, children with milder atypical pathogens may recover without antibiotic intervention. Causative pathogens also vary with age. Overall, viruses alone are a cause in younger children, in up to 50%. When a bacterial cause is found in older children, it is most commonly S. pneumoniae, followed by M. pneumoniae [7] .",

In the phase 4 study (NCT01669980), the safety and effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in children was evaluated in a multi-centre, randomised, observer-blinded, active-controlled trial [24] . Ceftaroline fosamil was compared with intravenous ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in patients aged between 2 months and 17 years with complicated CAP. Clinical response rates in the modified intention-to-treat population were 52% (15/29 patients) in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 67% in the comparator group (6/9); clinical stability at Study Day 4 was 21% of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP were included. Study participants included children aged 2-59 months with CAP. Twenty-two studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. A combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin was effective for very severe pneumonia, and oral amoxicillin was as effective as other parenteral antibiotics. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia. The review further found that a short 3-day course of antibiotics was as beneficial as 5-day course for non-severe pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months.",

However, there was no demonstrable correlation between the dose of amoxicillin and the rate of AAD. Importantly, there was an association between age and diarrhoea related to oral penicillin. Younger children aged 1 month to 2 years experienced higher rates of ADD (18%) than children aged 2-7 (4%) and those older than 7 years (2%). While it is important to consider AAD, the precise mechanism and robust evidence of a dose-to-AAD rate response remains to be demonstrated. Further work is required to assess the role of dose and duration on AAD rates and to include diarrhoea using a standardised definition as an outcome measure in randomised controlled trials.",

This review has not focussed on recent aetiology studies, or other data on advances in molecular diagnostics (e.g. pneumococcal DNA load) predicting viral or bacterial respiratory infection. A number of CAP amoxicillin trials are underway comparing varying dose and duration regimens, although there has been limited harmonisation as yet of study design. Not all of these trials may be relevant to the LMIC setting. Few trials as yet are including AMR outcomes, making assessment of optimal treatment recommendations at a population level from an AMR perspective currently not possible. There is a major need for further trials to determine the overall optimal duration of treatment of hospitalised children with severe and very severe pneumonia.

PCV13 targeted all major 19A and 7F genotypes, and decreased antimicrobial resistance, primarily owing to removal of the 19A/ST320 complex. The strain complex contributing most to the remaining \u03b2-lactam resistance during 2011-2013 was 35B/ST558. Significant emergence of non-vaccine clonal complexes was not evident. Because of the removal of vaccine serotype strains, positivity for one or both pilus types (PI-1 and PI-2) decreased in the post-PCV13 years 2011-2013 relative to 2008-2009 (decreases of 32-55% for PI-1, and > 95% for PI-2 and combined PI-1 + PI-2). Beta-lactam susceptibility phenotypes correlated consistently with transpeptidase region sequence combinations of the three major penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) determined through WGS analysis. Other major resistance features were predictable by DNA signatures from WGS analysis. Multilocus sequence data combined with PBP combinations identified progeny, serotype donors and recipient strains in serotype switch events. PCV13 decreased the frequency of all PCV13 serotype clones and concurrently decreased the frequency of strain subsets with resistance and/or adherence features conducive to successful carriage [38] .",

No differences were seen in disease severity or associated mortality among patients infected with PCV serotypes, compared with patients infected with non-vaccine serotypes. Invasive pneumococcal disease, older age, underlying chronic disease, immunosuppression and severity of disease were significantly associated with mortality. No association was found between nosocomial infection with invasive serotypes 1, 5, and 7 and mortality. The risk factors meningitis, suppurative lung complications and pre-existing lung disease were significantly associated with disease severity, independent of infecting serotype. Overall, host factors were more important than isolate serotype in determining the severity and outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults [39] .",
