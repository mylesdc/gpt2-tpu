Among its biotic pathologies, cotton blue disease (CBD) plays an important role due to its worldwide distribution and the high-magnitude of its associated productivity losses. Cotton blue disease was first described in the Central African Republic in 1949. It is transmitted by the aphid Aphis gossypii and its symptoms include leaf rolling, intense green foliage, vein yellowing, and a severe to moderate stunting caused by internodal shortening. Similar symptoms have also been observed in cotton crops of several regions of Africa, Asia and the Americas [1] . In Brazil, CBD is a serious crop problem capable of reducing the productivity of susceptible varieties by up to 80%, if intensive insecticidal control is not properly performed during the growing season.",

These viruses are transmitted by aphids in a circulative and persistent manner [4] , and are restricted to the phloem cells of their hosts.

ORF0 encodes a silencing suppressor protein, P0 [6] , and ORFs1 and 2 encode proteins related to viral replication, including the viral RNA polymerase [5] . Between the nonstructural and structural protein sequences exists an intergenic region (IR) involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis [5, 7, 8] . The major coat protein (CP) is encoded by ORF3 at the 3' portion of the genome. The viral movement protein is encoded by ORF4, which lies within the CP gene sequence but in another reading frame [9] . ORF5 is expressed by occasional suppression of the CP termination codon [10] and encodes the read-through domain (RTD) required for efficient aphid transmission [11, 12] The genetic variability of plant viral populations is an important aspect of their evolution and epidemiology [13] . Variation among isolates may affect virulence, infectivity, transmission, and symptom severity, and therefore is important to consider when developing strategies for disease control [14] . To better understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties obtained from five of the six most important cottongrowing states of the country. This work represents the first time that isolates of CBD-associated viruses have been analyzed at the molecular level.",

Sequences inside the black boxes are associated with subgenomic RNA formation [7] . terization of its causal agent at the molecular level, its viral population and/or isolate diversity have not previously been reported. We previously described a virus associated with CBD in Brazil [3] . This virus, CLRDV, was present in CBD-symptomatic plants from a crop field in Primavera do Leste, MT. Here we map for the first time the genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazilian cotton fields covering the most important producer regions. Analyzing 23 new viral isolates, we observed a low diversity in the CP CLRDV gene. However, phylogenetic analysis of this sequence revealed a small genetic distance between CV2, PO1, and PL3 and the other CLRDV isolates, clustering them in different groups. These results may suggest a co-adaptation phenomenon, resulting from selection pressure, among the divergent and the other CLRDV isolates, giving rise very similar CP sequences. Indeed, evolutionary studies concerning the CP of Luteoviridae members show that this protein is subjected to various selection pressures [22] . The CP is directly associated with the success of infection, as it is involved in viral transmission, particle packaging, and viral accumulation within the plant [23, 24] . Thus, a high degree of conservation in the CP protein sequence is expected.",

Our analysis of the IR, however, contradicted this model, and showed a low diversity in this region comparable to that of the RdRp sequence.

Furthermore, symptomatology differences are also an important criterion for species discrimination.

The horizontal axis represents the nucleotide distance of the midpoint of the window (covering 100 pb). The vertical axis represents the percentage of trees (using 100 bootstrap replicates) that support branching with the divergent isolate query sequence. The values for one Enamovirus (PEMV-1), one Luteovirus (BYDV-MAV), the four Polerovirus with the highest bootstraps (TYV, CYDV-RPV, BWYV, and BMYV), and TVDV (an unclassified member of the family) are represented. The GenBank accession numbers for these sequences are listed in the Material and Methods section.",

A phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region revealed a clear segregation between PL3, CV2, and PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates identified in this study, forming two monophyletic clusters. This segregation was partially observed in the phylogeny of the CP gene, although the dendograms for this sequence revealed a stronger relationship among the divergents and the other CLRDV isolates.Taxonomic characterization of the divergent isolates using phylogenetic analyses indicated that PL3, CV2, and PO1 have a Polerovirus-like RdRp and a CLRDV-like CP. Moreover, the IR between the RdRp and CP sequences from divergent isolates have 187 nt, the same as that in CLRDV[3]. Thus, their IRs resemble those of Polerovirus members, which are ~200 nt long, and differ from those of Luteovirus members, which are ~100 nt long. Taken together, these data suggest that the three divergent isolates could result from recombination events between CLRDV ancestors and another member of the genus Polerovirus. Evidence of recombination was found using three different methods (Simplot, GARD, and Bootscan). However, we were unable to detect a parental sequence for PL3, CV2, or PO1. Thus, the Polerovirus member involved in recombination with CLRDV remains unknown.",
