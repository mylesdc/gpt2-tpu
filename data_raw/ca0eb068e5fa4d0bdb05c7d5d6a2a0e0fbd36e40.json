A study by Anh et al. documented high rates of colonization density (!6 log 10 CFU/mL) measured by culture among NP swab samples from Vietnamese children with pneumonia [14] . A similarly high value of pneumococcal load (%6 log 10 copies/mL) quantified by PCR in NP samples was reported by Vu et al. for children with community-acquired pneumonia with radiological confirmation in the same country [15] while Fan et al. observed a slightly lower density (4.5-5 log 10 copies/mL) for young Peruvian children with acute respiratory infection [16] . Interestingly, no threshold value for colonization density was established in these pediatric studies, probably because of the difficulty to establish such a value among children with disease and carriers, both of them having a high NP pneumococcal load.",

In a subsequent study on the same population, they proposed a similar cut-off value of 10,000 copies/mL for good-quality sputum lytA real-time PCR, albeit with slightly lower sensitivity and specificity values (78.1% and 80.0%, respectively), to discriminate HIV-infected adults with pneumococcal pneumonia from controls [18] . Stralin et al. documented cut-off values of 100 copies/mL for NP aspirates and 4.5 log 10 copies/mL for sputum measured by quantitative lytA real-time PCR in an elder Swedish pneumonia cohort [19] . Use of real-time PCR detection on sputum samples was also postulated by Yang et al. for rapid diagnosis of adult CAP pneumonia in an Emergency Department [20] . This group determined an AUC of 0.87 under the ROC curve, reporting sensitivity and specificity values of 90% and 80% respectively for a cut-off of 37,000 copies/mL. We speculate that the ! 2-log difference in the cut-off value between these studies on adult populations and ours could primarily be due to the impaired immune response during first years of life related with the high rates of carriage in children [32] , in addition to different sampling and quantification methods and epidemiological characteristics. Given the high densities of pneumococcal carriage (up to 8.5 log 10 copies/mL) found in cases we estimate that the relatively high threshold value calculated in our study (6.5 log 10 copies/mL) may have diagnostic utility to diagnose pediatric IPD.",

In the light of these diagnostic innovations, the potential implications and applicability of our findings are promising, particularly for pediatric populations, who would also benefit from the high diagnostic yield of NP washed in addition to the convenience of the sampling method. As a novel biomarker, NP pneumococcal DNA load may allow designing point-of-care tests capable of quantifying bacterial load in a simple manner. In addition, the results of the multivariate analysis assessing independent risk factors for IPD suggest that the adoption of a holistic approach by combining quantification of NP pneumococcal load with serotype identification, and quantification of blood markers could substantially increase overall diagnostic yield. Such comprehensive approach would especially be suitable in reference healthcare settings with laboratory infrastructures equipped to routinely perform all these techniques.",

First, our total sample size was small, although the analysis seems to have been sufficiently powered to show real differences in NP pneumococcal load between cases and controls, and the differences observed between groups are biologically plausible to prove the concept. Second, in spite of the fact that a case-control approach appears suitable for the testing of the project's hypothesis, restricting the selection of controls to a short period of time once all cases had been recruited could have introduced important biases in our results, particularly related to variability in patient's characteristics, or with year-to-year variations of the different infections (bacterial and viral) assessed, or the incidence of infecting pneumococcal serotypes. A comparability analysis was performed to control the potential confounding effect of seasonality on NP colonization density. However the small sample size hinders our capacity to evaluate year-to-year variation of circulating serotypes. Third, HIV status in controls was unknown but we have no reason to suspect that it could be considerably different from that reported for healthy children in the same community, for whom a low HIV prevalence in a range of 3-5% has been documented [12] . Moreover, when we performed a sub-analysis of cases there were not significant differences in mean NP pneumococcal load between HIV co-infected and not co-infected subjects, which suggests that this factor does not substantially increase NP density of pneumococcus in young patients. Finally, these results are drawn from a population with very high background prevalence rates of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage, as previously described, and it remains to be seen whether the threshold obtained in our study would remain valid in areas with lower carriage rates [34] .",
