The HPIV species viruses are responsible for 30-40% of all acute respiratory tract infections in infants and children 1 . Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus of the henipavirus genus that represents a global health risk with broad, unpredictable pandemic potential. Infection with this virus is devastating, rapidly causing a generalized vasculitis leading to lethal encephalitis and serious respiratory infections. The common natural reservoirs of henipavirus genus members (including NiV, Hendra virus, Cedar virus and numerous newly identified species) are fruit bats 2,3 , but recent identification of rodent-origin henipa-like viruses that cause lethal respiratory disease in humans suggests that the range of natural mammalian hosts may be even broader 4 . Transmitted by air or food, its mechanism of infection is complex, and no drugs exist to prevent or treat infection. The recent human-to-human spread of NiV in Asia has raised the real possibility of global spread. NiV and HPIV, while different in their associated diseases and geography, infect using similar mechanisms and are vulnerable to the same antiviral strategy.",

For HPIV3, NiV, and other paramyxoviruses, the surface glycoproteins play critical roles in the initial events of viral infection, mediating virion attachment to cells and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The viral fusion protein (F), upon insertion of the fusion peptide -formed after cleavage of the precursor F into its final fragment -into the host target cell membrane, forms a transient intermediate to pull the viral and cell membranes together. Two heptad-repeat regions that are present in each ectodomain of F refold to form a highly stable, antiparallel six-helix bundle structure that is coupled to membrane fusion. The structure required for this step can be specifically targeted by fusion-inhibitory peptides. The N-terminal repeat (HRN) is adjacent to the hydrophobic fusion peptide that inserts into the target cell membrane during the fusion process. The C-terminal repeat (HRC) immediately precedes the transmembrane domain. A folding-back of the F ectodomain drives the viral membrane towards the cell-associated fusion peptide to bring the two membranes into proximity, causing membrane fusion and viral entry.",

We have shown the potential of modified fusion inhibitor peptides as NiV and HPIV antiviral agents, and showed that a sequence corresponding to the HRC domain of HPIV3 effectively inhibits both HPIV3 and NiV 6 . Interhelical packing interactions in the post-fusion core of the NiV and HPIV3 F proteins are important determinants of viral entry and its inhibition. Fusion inhibitor peptides can be engineered at the level of these parameters, for optimal inhibition, increasing potency for both viruses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Conjugating cholesterol to a fusion inhibitor peptide enhances NiV antiviral activity up to 100-fold, by targeting the peptide to the plasma membrane where fusion occurs 8 and endows the fusion inhibitor with the ability to localize to the central nervous system, successfully preventing and treating NiV infection in a golden hamster model of disease 6 . Surprisingly, the most effective antiviral peptides for NiV and the related Hendra virus (HeV) are those derived from the F of HPIV3. The antiviral strategy discussed here exploits the uniquely broad spectrum antiviral activity of these HPIV3 derived inhibitory peptides to treat paramyxovirus infection. In an effort to understand the biophysical properties that correlate with peptide efficacy and thereby improve upon their antiviral utility, we explored biophysical features of the lipid-conjugated peptides that alter aggregation and membrane insertion kinetics. We have identified several properties that correlate with the peptides' potency and permit enhancement of antiviral effect for both HPIV3 and NiV.",

Here we investigated the impact of the peptide orientation, as well as the influence of the PEG linker length, on the peptide antiviral efficacy. We focus on PEG linkers for exploration of these mechanisms since PEG features a number of characteristics that may be critical for tissue penetration of cholesterol-tagged peptides. PEG is soluble in both aqueous and organic media, and thus compatible with both plasma/extracellular fluids and membrane environment. Unlike alkyl linkers, PEG linkers do not cause aggregation and precipitation in the compounds in which they are incorporated. PEG is used to prevent non-specific adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces, being non-toxic and non-immunogenic. The amino acid sequence and the modifications introduced into the peptides used for this study are shown in Fig. 1a . The entire set of peptides used here is based on a single peptide with the \"VG\" sequence, which has E549V 9 and Q479G introduced into our published HPIV3 F HRC-derived peptide 10 .

Cholesterol conjugation improved peptide inhibition of cell-cell fusion mediated by HPIV3 and NiV glycoproteins, as expected. Incorporation of a PEG 4 spacer significantly enhanced peptide efficacy against both viral glycoproteins. Increasing the linker length to PEG 12 did not improve upon this result.

All conjugated peptides showed potency against HPIV3 in this assay, with the N-terminally conjugated peptides significantly more effective at blocking fusion. For NiV, in contrast, Chol-VG has too little effect to determine an IC50 against NiV fusion. Only C-terminally conjugated peptides blocked the NiV glycoprotein-mediated fusion with high efficacy in the presence of the PEG linkers. The efficacy of the HPIV3 HRC-derived peptide against HPIV3 itself is higher when spacer and lipid are conjugated N-terminally, but this results in a loss of multipotency against NiV. These results suggest that both orientation of the peptide sequence and the length of the spacer are important for antiviral multipotency.",

In previous studies, we used HRC-derived lipid-conjugated peptides to investigate the conformational flexibility of uncleaved F protein (F in its precursor protein form, with the hydrophobic fusion domain still buried) 12 . The peptides bind to their corresponding HRN domains only when they are exposed by the unfolding of F, and serve as a tool to identify this exposure. For these experiments, peptides are attached to red blood cell (RBC) membranes via their cholesterol tails, and the RBCs are allowed to interact with cells expressing an uncleaved mutant of HPIV3 F (K108G) along with HN to engage the sialic acid receptor on the RBCs and initiate F-activation. The read-out for peptide interaction with the F protein's HRN is adherence of the RBCs to the F-expressing cells. Since the uncleaved F cannot insert into the RBC membrane, this adherence occurs only via a peptide \"bridge\" formed when the peptide that is anchored to the RBC via its lipid tail also interacts with the HRN sequence of F expressed on the transfected cells 12 . The uncleaved F has enough flexibility to unfold and expose the HRN domain upon activation by HN, but cannot fully extend into the transient \"pre-hairpin\" intermediate with its hydrophobic end inserted into the target membrane 12 . For exploring peptide function, this assay provides a measure of the efficiency with which peptides bind at an early stage in the fusion process before the F-insertion step. Here we used the \"peptide bridging\" assay to assess the interaction of the series of modified VG peptides with the early transitional steps of F protein (Fig. 3 ). 293T cells co-expressing HPIV3 HN and uncleaved F (cleavage site mutant K108G, csm) were allowed to interact with receptor-bearing RBCs at 4 \u00b0C, then transferred to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of either C-terminally or N-terminally conjugated peptides (1 \u03bc M) with or without PEG 4 linkers. Zanamivir, a sialic acid analog that blocks HN-receptor interaction 13, 14 was added after 1 h to disengage cells that were bound by HN-receptor engagement alone. The proportion of RBCs that were either free, reversibly bound by HN-receptor interaction (and therefore released by zanamivir), irreversibly bound by peptide bridging, or fused was quantified.",

In contrast, VG-Chol (C-terminally lipid conjugated) peptide bridged the cell populations by attaching the F protein to the plasma membrane of the RBCs, as suggested by the 35% of irreversibly bound RBCs in the presence of this peptide. PEG spacers in the peptides led to an increase in bridging (as seen by irreversible RBC binding), for both the C-terminally and the N-terminally conjugated peptides, with the C-terminally conjugated peptides being significantly more effective at interacting with the early transitional intermediate of F. Since the spacer-less Chol-VG failed to bridge, this result suggests that the spacer permits the N-terminally conjugated peptide to insert into the RBC membrane. Of the peptides tested, VG-PEG4-Chol showed the most effective bridging, more than 50% irreversible retention, while the peptide that was most effective at inhibiting fusion inhibition, VG-PEG24-Chol (Fig. 2) , looks similar to VG-Chol, a far less effective inhibitor. As further explored below, this may relate to the more dynamic membrane insertion of VG-PEG24-Chol, allowing release of the \"bridge\" mediated by this peptide and release of attached RBCs. PEG linkers improve the solubility of HPIV3 derived peptides. The aggregation and lipid-binding properties of VG peptides were assessed based on the intrinsic fluorescence of their tryptophan (Trp) residues (Fig. 4a) . The fluorescence excitation spectra of VG peptides in buffer nearly overlap that of free Trp. Regarding the fluorescence emission spectra, only the untagged peptide VG showed a close overlap with Trp spectrum. The peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKAKSDLEESKEWIRRSNGKLDSI-GSGSG-C of HPIV3 F with a GSGSG spacer and C for thioether reaction).

Fig. 5a , VG peptides are able to induce changes on the surface pressure of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 -phosphocholine (POPC) monolayers. Only VG and the peptide solvent control with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed no changes on the lipid monolayer. VG-PEG24-Chol was the most active peptide by inducing the largest change on the monolayer surface pressure, with \u0394 \u03a0 max ~ 4 mN/m (Fig. 5b) . Increasing concentrations of VG peptides led to an increase on the surface pressure, until a plateau of peptide saturation on the monolayer is reached. These data allow the use of equation (1) to calculate the dissociation constant, K d . Despite the similar affinity for POPC (Fig. 5d ), VG peptides presented very distinct kinetics towards this lipid (Fig. 5c ). Using equation (2), a higher insertion rate, k, was observed for VG-PEG24-Chol (7.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 ), in comparison with VG-PEG4-Chol and VG-Chol (Fig. 5c,d) .

As an indirect reporter, we used the lipophilic fluorescent probe di-8-ANEPPS to measure the interaction of the peptides with the cell membranes. RBCs were labeled with this probe as previously reported [15] [16] [17] . The VG peptides were incubated with the RBCs during 1 h. The cholesterol-tagged peptides were able to induce changes on the membrane dipole potential sensed by di-8-ANEPPS (Fig. 6 ). The VG peptide and the control DMSO did not cause any change on the membrane dipole potential. As a quantitative measure of the interaction of VG peptides with membranes, the ratio R was measured for a range of peptide concentrations. This ratio decreases upon increasing the concentration of cholesterol-tagged peptides, following a hyperbolic curve. These curves were fitted with equation ( Protease sensitivity of HPIV3 derived peptides. We recently tested the hypothesis that while lipid conjugation decreases protease sensitivity, addition of PEG linkers increases protease sensitivity. Figure 7 shows VG series peptides incubated in the absence (\u2212) or presence (+ ) of trypsin, at 0.025 \u03bcg/\u03bcl for 1 hr at 0 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. Cholesterol conjugation to VG decreased protease degradation at 0\u00b0 (compare panel A lane 2 to lanes 5 and 8). Adding the PEG24 linker and cholesterol at the C-terminus increased degradation significantly (panel B lane 5). However when the cholesterol (with or without PEG linker) is conjugated to the N-terminus, the peptides were significantly more resistant to protease degradation. Panel C shows that even at 37\u00b0 the peptides with N-terminal tags are not degraded.",

As expected, cholesterol conjugation significantly ameliorated the peptide efficacy against both viruses, as measured by reduction in plaque formation. While the presence of the PEG4 linker had no impact on the peptide's IC90 against HPIV3 (~1 nM) it reduced the IC90 for inhibition of NiV (from 300 nM to 50 nM). An increase in spacer length to PEG24 led to a significant increase of efficacy against both HPIV3 (IC90 ~ 0.1 nM) and NiV (IC90 ~ 2 nM). In addition, we evaluated the toxicity and specificity of the peptides. Table 1 shows that toxicity of VG-PEG24-Chol on cells appears only when we reach a concentration of 1000 nM (10,000 \u00d7 The IC90); toxicity of the other peptides in the series was even lower. Since VG-PEG24-Chol, although quite non-toxic, had the highest toxicity of all the peptides in this series, we chose this peptide for an experiment designed to assess specificity of inhibition. We compared the antiviral effect of VG-PEG24-Chol to PEG24-Chol conjugated peptides that are effective against measles, influenza virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. None of these peptides were inhibitory for HPIV3, supporting the notion that potency depends on the presence of the HPIV3 peptide sequence, not simply on the linker or lipid moiety ( Table 1) .",

The fluorescence spectra of the VG series peptides (Fig. 4) showed that the conjugation of cholesterol leads to a change on the microenvironment of the fluorescent tryptophan residues. These results indicate a more hydrophobic setting surrounding the tryptophan, suggesting a possible peptide aggregation. The data from the ANS experiments (Fig. 4) confirmed this hypothesis, showing that incorporating PEG24 on the VG series peptides partially decreases aggregation.

In other words, it seems that since the pocket binding domain of the antiviral peptide is more exposed it is more potent, but also more sensitive to protease. This could potentially explain why the level of VG-PEG24-Chol in the brain and serum is relatively low compared to our previous data for other peptides 6, 19 . The finding that the longer PEG increases protease sensitivity is part of the complexity of identifying ideal candidates for in vivo testing; one must identify a balance between absolute antiviral potency and stability.

The efficacy of N-terminally lipid conjugated fusion inhibitory peptides has been studied for both Ebola 21 and Newcastle Disease virus 23 . In the case of Newcastle Disease virus, Li et al. showed that N-terminal cholesterol conjugation enhanced the potency of inhibitory peptides and allowed them to penetrate the CNS, while the effect of addition of a PEG3 linker between the N-terminal cholesterol and the inhibitory peptide was less clear. In our case, the linker between N-terminal cholesterol and peptide significantly enhances anti-HPIV3 potency, while abrogating broad-spectrum antiviral activity. We speculate that without a flexible linker, the N-terminally conjugated peptides could not attain the proper position for interacting with the target region on F -or could do so only when not anchored in the membrane or later in the fusion process (after fusion peptide insertion and during the refolding step). The mechanistic basis for the negative effect on inhibition of NiV remains to be explored. As shown schematically in Fig. 11 , a flexible PEG linker allows for freedom of orientation in order to align properly with the target HRN domain, or for more dynamic kinetic of insertion into the membrane. This may be an advantage not only for interacting with the F protein once it has inserted into the host cell membrane (at which point it is a target for both lipid-conjugated and unconjugated peptide inhibitors) 6 but also for interacting with the pre-insertion F. The pre-insertion F protein is shown in Fig. 11 as extended into a transient intermediate in panel Animals were euthanized after 3 days and virus titers were determined from lung homogenates in plaque assays.

The peptide with a PEG-24 linker (Fig. 11d,e) has been shown to be the most effective inhibitor but to less potently capture early intermediates of F activation (see Fig. 3 ). Based on the biophysical data showing the increased dynamic membrane interaction for this peptide, we speculate that this peptide may flip between the target host cell (panel d) and the viral membrane (panel e), reducing observed capture of F while increasing efficacy. These mechanisms could also explain why the N-terminally conjugated peptides may be rendered effective by a long linker which could either optimize alignment with F or permit activity from both cell and viral surfaces. In this study, we focused on peptides with the lipid conjugation at the C-terminus because this approach led to conservation of the broad antiviral spectrum -a primary goal of this work. However in light of the advantage shown by the N-terminally conjugated peptides in terms of protease sensitivity, we will also explore the effect of longer PEG linkers on potency and protease sensitivity of N-linked peptides and determine the basis for the difference in antiviral spectrum conferred by orientation of the lipid moiety. Future studies will address the issue of protease sensitivity, in addition to varying the location of the lipophilic moiety, by modifying the amino acid backbone so as to render it less protease sensitive.",

The lipid moiety drives the interaction between the peptides and the lipid membrane, and is a determinant for the affinity of the compounds toward the membrane. As the cholesterol moiety is conserved among the active compounds we assessed here, it may explain the similar dissociation constants obtained for the different molecules. However, we observed significant differences in the kinetic behavior of each peptide. VG-PEG24-Chol exhibits the fastest kinetics of membrane insertion, followed by VG-PEG4-Chol. The addition of cholesterol to the lipid monolayers boosts the kinetic rate constant of all peptides; only the most potent peptides interact well with membranes in the absence of cholesterol in the target membrane (data not shown). We speculate that the linear membranotropic (association/dissociation from membrane) properties associated with the effective peptides also affect biodistribution and therefore in vivo efficacy, as they may circulate in association with RBCs. We assessed the serum and RBCs from peptide-dosed animals, and found that peptides are present both in the plasma and on the surface of the RBCs (data not shown). Association with RBCs may be one mechanism whereby the lipid moieties enhance half-life in vivo. Addition of PEG linkers, while significantly enhancing potency, confers protease sensitivity, an issue that may be mitigated by measures including N-terminal conjugation. This understanding of the set of properties that correlate with the peptides' potency permits enhancement of antiviral effect of HPIV3-derived peptides for both HPIV3 and NiV. In addition to guiding peptide design, these principles will be used to obtain the optimal balance of orientation, lipid moiety, valency, linker length, and amino acid sequence with the goal of broad spectrum activity for paramyxoviruses.",

In this assay, receptor-bearing cells expressing the omega peptide of \u00df-Gal are mixed with cells co-expressing envelope glycoproteins and the alpha peptide of \u00df-Gal, and cell fusion leads to alpha-omega complementation. Fusion is stopped by lysing the cells and, after addition of the substrate ( \u00ae The Tropix Galacto-Star \u2122 chemiluminescent reporter assay system, Applied Biosystem), fusion is quantified on a Spectramax M5 microplate reader. In the overnight fusion assay, cells expressing both alpha and omega peptides of \u00df-Gal were co-cultured for up to 20 h.",
