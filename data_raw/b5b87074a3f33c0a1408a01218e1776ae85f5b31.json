            "text": "This study was performed to investigate the mechanism of action of ursolic acid in terms of anti-Toxoplasma gondii effects, including immunomodulatory effects. We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-\u03b2, while reducing the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity. different sub-proteins such as IMC sub-compartment proteins 1, 2, and 3 [2] [3] [4] . The protein kinases of T. gondii have been known to play key roles for modulating the motility, invasion, replication, egress, and survival within the host [5] . It was reported that T. gondii is divided through a unique form of cell division such as endodyogeny, and its chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle [6] . Furthermore, T. gondii not only forms a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) after invasion into host cells, but also proliferates and grows into a PVM [7-9]. For decades, several compounds through many researchers and groups were developed as drugs for treating toxoplasmosis, and are usefully used in clinics. However, existing drugs are widely vulnerable to drug-resistance in clinics globally. To overcome pharmacological barriers to these challenges, the efforts for treating infectious diseases have been attempted in various fields, and it has been reported that various extracts/compounds derived from medicinal plants and new synthetic compounds have anti-T. gondii effects in the in vitro and pre-clinic stages [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Until recently, various compounds derived from plants have showed a leading role and ability as a source of specialized metabolites with medical effects as well as pharmacological activities. In addition, it was reported that various extracts/compounds derived from plants and synthetic compounds could be used in the medical field as useful resources for treating acute or chronic infectious diseases caused by schistosomiasis, leishmania, malaria, or tuberculosis, as well as viral diseases including middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) or Zika fever and avian influenza [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

In this context, various studies on the development or discovery of effective drugs and novel candidates against parasitic zoonosis are urgently required. In this regard, ursolic acid is a bioactive compound derived from medicinal plants, and is also known to have selective bioactive properties such as anti-inflammatory [24-27] and anticancer effects [28] [29] [30] [31] . It also effectively induces various activities, including antimicrobial [32-34] and anti-parasitic effects [35, 36] . Until recently, although studies and compounds regarding anti-T. gondii activity have been reported globally [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , the mechanism of action of ursolic acid on the inhibitory effect of T. gondii and the immunomodulatory activity was not reported yet. From this perspective, this study was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory activity of ursolic acid in terms of anti-T. gondii effects and activity, and to confirm the potential as a potent candidate drug for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents.",

Before evaluating the mechanism of action of ursolic acid against T. gondii, we measured the inhibitory effect of ursolic acid (UA) against the survival of T. gondii and normal lung cells infected with T. gondii through an MTT assay as described previously [9] , which showed significant results and reproducibility. When T. gondii was treated with UA (12.5-400 \u00b5g/mL) for 24 h, the viability was effectively inhibited, and the parasitic survival rate was measured as less than 30% at 200 \u00b5g/mL. UA strongly decreased the viability of T. gondii compared with sulfadiazine (SF), which demonstrates that UA caused anti-T. gondii effect or activity against T. gondi (data not shown). In particular, the lung cells infected with T. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid (12.5-200 \u00b5g/mL) when compared with the untreated infection cells and the T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF ( Figure 2) . Furthermore, it was clearly shown that there were significant differences between the untreated T. gondii-group and the experimental groups. In these aspects, it was demonstrated that UA effectively induced the selective anti-parasitic effect/action compared to the SF-treated group and the untreated group through a direct inhibitory effect on the Pathogens 2019, 8, 61 3 of 18",

In this respect, the prevention and education of various zoonotic diseases are becoming a major issue. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease that is induced through the infection of Toxoplasma gondii in many countries worldwide as a zoonotic parasitosis, causing serious diseases and chronic infection in various sites of the human body in all age groups, including adults and young children as well as pregnant women. In particular, because toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease that infects humans through cats, many people that have cats as pets, particularly pregnant women, need to take caution in this regard. In the biological aspect, T. gondii not only has intracellular organelles such as the golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrion, but also unique subcellular organelles such as the conoid, apicoplast, surface antigens (SAGs), dense granule proteins (GRAs), rhoptries, and micronemes [1] . T. gondii has an inner membrane complex (IMC) involving the plasma membrane, consisting of a unique double membrane structure which is combined with a cytoskeletal network. The IMC acts as a major factor in the proliferation and growth for the survival of T. gondii, as well as in motility and cell division, which has been reported to include the T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, it was clearly shown that there were significant differences between the untreated T. gondii-group and the experimental groups. In these aspects, it was demonstrated that UA effectively induced the selective anti-parasitic effect/action compared to the SF-treated group and the untreated group through a direct inhibitory effect on the viability of T. gondii. This shows that UA has the potential to be utilized as an anti-T. gondii candidate agent and/or a synergic compound with the existing drugs for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents.

In this aspect, we investigated the inhibitory action of UA against subcellular organelles such as rhoptries, micronemes, and inner membrane complex that form its intracellular metabolic network as well as the homeostasis of T. gondii. As shown in Figure 3 , when T. gondii was treated with different concentrations (50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL) of UA and SF, respectively, the intracellular organelles (rhoptry protein 18 (ROP 18), microneme protein 8 (MIC 8), and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3 (IMC sub-3)) of T. gondii were markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and their changes were clearly observed under electrophoresis.

Organelles of T. gondii   T. gondii causes unique anti-apoptotic features and parasitic survival cycles or stages, such as the  inactivation of apoptotic proteins during the parasitic life-cycle in host cells after infection, showing  critical roles during the proliferation and survival of T. gondii. In particular, the PVM, that functions as a critical indicator during the proliferation stage of T. gondii, is activated in a time-dependent manner after cell invasion of T. gondii, which causes finally the proliferation and the growth of T. gondii. In this aspect, we investigated the inhibitory action of UA against subcellular organelles such as rhoptries, micronemes, and inner membrane complex that form its intracellular metabolic network as well as the homeostasis of T. gondii. As shown in Figure 3 , when T. gondii was treated with different concentrations (50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL) of UA and SF, respectively, the intracellular organelles (rhoptry protein 18 (ROP 18), microneme protein 8 (MIC 8), and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3 (IMC sub-3)) of T. gondii were markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and their changes were clearly observed under electrophoresis. In particular, it is known that rhoptry plays as a critical factor when T. gondii enters into host cells during invasion stage [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . In these aspects, this result shows clearly that UA not only has the direct inhibitory effect against the survival of T. gondii but also induces the anti-T. gondii effect by strongly blocking or inhibiting the homeostasis and network structure of the intracellular organelles of T. gondii. Therefore, these results demonstrate substantial evidence that UA consistently causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the intracellular organelles of T. gondii. We evaluated the effect of ROS and NO production induced by ursolic acid in immune cells infected with T. gondii. The production of NO and ROS was measured in a dose-dependent manner when T. gondii-infected co-cultured immune cells were incubated with various concentrations (25-100 \u00b5g/mL) of UA and SF for 24 h, respectively. In particular, the production of ROS was increased in the T. gondii-infected group treated with UA compared with T. gondii-infected group. However, in 100 \u00b5g/mL of UA, ROS activity gradually indicated lower concentrations than other UA-treated groups (Figure 4 ), and these changes of ROS activity show that UA acts as a modulator which consistently inhibits the proliferation and the growth of T. gondii by promoting the production of ROS in immune cells after the parasite infection. Even though SF-treated groups significantly increased ROS production compared to the T. gondii-infected group, there were low ROS-productive rates compared to UA-treated groups. Furthermore, the rate of NO production was strongly increased in T. gondii-infected group treated with UA compared with normal and T. gondii-infected groups, but in the range of 100 \u00b5g/mL of UA, the rate of NO production were low concentrations compared with other UA-treated groups ( Figure 5 ). However, the activities of both ROS and NO induced by UA were significantly increased more than normal and infection groups. Interestingly, the activities of ROS and NO in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF were lower than T. gondii-infected groups treated with UA. The activities of ROS and NO were significantly increased in T. gondii-infected groups treated with UA and SF, respectively, whereas their activities were gradually reduced in high concentrations. These results show that UA not only consistently induces the production of ROS and NO through the interaction between it and immune cells in T. gondii-infected immune cells, but may also be used as a synergic compound for the immunomodulation after parasitic infection.

The production of the cytokines (interferon-\u03b2, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)) in T. gondii-infected immune cells was notably changed in a concentration-dependent manner when the cells were incubated with different concentrations (25-100 \u03bcg/mL) of UA, and their changes were measured under an ELISA reader.

Among various parasites, T. gondii induces serious symptoms such as cerebral calcification and meningoencephalitis in the brain, while causing fetal infection through mother during pregnancy, as it is a zoonotic parasite which affects both humans and animals, resulting in parasitic diseases such as toxoplasmosis [49, 50] . Furthermore, it induces serious complications in immune-deficient patients and HIV patients, which attenuates the interaction of the immune system that specifically responds to pathogens in the host [51, 52] . T. gondii inhibits the interaction of cytokines such as IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 that are activated through the immune system, attenuating the production of cytokines from host cells. In addition, it is known that T. gondii blocks parasitic inhibitory system while inhibiting the signal pathways of cell cycle initiators or apoptotic mediators for the apoptotic stage in host cells after invasion [53, 54] . T. gondii infection induces an imbalance of immune response by causing changes in cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in the host, resulting in immune deficiency by breaking homeostasis and interaction of the immune system in the host. Moreover, T. gondii induces the proliferative and growth cycle of T. gondii by rapidly forming PVM and by regulating cell cycle factors for its survival in host cells, maintaining the survival by accelerating the proliferation of T. gondii in host [55, 56] . The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, such as the conoid, GRAs, SAGs, the rhoptry, microneme proteins, and the inner membrane complex, were focused upon as major targets for blocking T. gondii infection, which was used as major recombinant proteins or factors for protective immunity including vaccination [57] [58] [59] [60] . For these reasons, in this study we not only evaluated the anti-parasitic effect of UA which inhibits the survival of parasite after T. gondii infection through a T. gondii-infected co-cultured immune system, but also confirmed its mechanism of action with respect to anti-T. gondii effects and immunomodulatory activity. In the present study, the survival rates of T. gondii were markedly inhibited when the parasites were treated with UA and SF compared with the non-treated T. gondii group, and the expression of subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii in the infected cells was effectively decreased in T. gondii-infected group treated with UA compared with other groups. Furthermore, the production of ROS and NO was significantly increased in the T. gondii-infected group treated with UA compared with both SF-treated and infection groups. Interestingly, although ROS production was activated in both T. gondii-infected cells treated with UA and SF, its rate was gradually decreased in the range of high concentrations of the compounds. In these aspects, NO and ROS production not only activates immune defense systems against various pathogens such as bacteria and viruses but also maintains effectively the changes of the homeostasis in the organism, promoting the production of cytokines induced by the interaction of immune cells. Cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased in the infected cells after T. gondii infection, and their production was significantly suppressed after UA treatment. In particular, although the production of TGF-\u03b21 was reduced in T. gondii-infected immune cells treated with UA, it was shown that UA suppressed the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in immune cells by inhibiting the survival of T. gondii. In addition, UA not only effectively increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and interferon-\u03b2 in T. gondii-infected cells but also activated the expression of IL-12 and GM-CSF, promoting the development of Th1 cells and the production of interferon-\u03b3 that is induced by NK cells.",

Furthermore, these results indicated that the expression of subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii was specifically inhibited or blocked in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with UA. This study provides evidence that UA not only decreases the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) expressed from the immune cells after T. gondii infection, but also effectively increases the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, IL-12, GM-CSF, and interferon-\u03b2, including the activation of ROS and NO production. Interestingly, it was confirmed in this study that macrophage and other immune cells did not directly inhibit or rapidly decrease the survival of parasite as well as the proliferation of T. gondii through the bactericidal action such as phagocytosis of macrophage after T. gondii infection. This may be the result of the differences between the in vitro system and the in vivo experiment including rats and mice. However, the parasite may not be eliminated by the bactericidal action of macrophages and other immune cells in the infected body because T. gondii is found in various body sites of patients in the clinic. Moreover, it may be changed or maintained to the parasite type that indicates characteristics of hibernation like T. gondii ME49 strain (type II) in the body.",

Furthermore, the results indicate that UA induces the death of T. gondii by promoting the production of ROS and NO, such as super oxides and hydroxyl radicals in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that UA can be used effectively as a potent candidate agent or a synergic compound with existing drugs in the development of novel anti-T. gondii drugs of the next generation against toxoplasmosis, with potential as a modulatory substance against the immune response of the parasite in parasite-infected immune cells. Moreover, UA requires further study for efficacy and safety against toxoplasmosis in preclinical stages through in vivo animal models in the near future. ",

One pair of primers was designed using the Primer 3 (version 4.1) and NCBI primer-blast according to the sequence of the selected specific gene in NCBI GenBank as follows: T. gondii MIC 8 (accession number: AF353165, 2055 bp), ROP 18 (accession number: AM075204, 1665 bp), IMC sub-3 (accession number: HQ012579, 495 bp), and \u03b2-actin (accession number: NM031144, 1128 bp). The specific genes of T. gondii were synthesized to complementary DNA (cDNA) through one-step RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The cDNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 10 \u00b5g/mL ethidium bromide at 120 V for 1 h, which was visualized under ultraviolet illumination. The \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard for the amount of the expression of cDNA present in each sample. The groups were divided into the untreated positive group (T. gondii-infected group) and experimental groups (UA and SF-treated groups).",

Briefly, after the co-culture cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 \u00d7 10 5 /well), the cells were infected with T. gondii (1:4, cells/parasite ratio), which was incubated with different concentrations (25-100 \u00b5g/mL) of UA and SF for 24 h, respectively. The NO and ROS production were measured in the control and treated groups according to the manufacturer's instructions through NO and ROS production kits (Cell Biolabs, Inc.

First, the macrophage and basophil cells were sequentially seeded in a 6-well plate (1 \u00d7 10 5 /well) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 in air at 37 \u2022 C. Second, T cells and B cells were additionally seeded in the plate (1 \u00d7 10 5 /well) after 24 h. Namely, the co-cultured immune cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (4 \u00d7 10 5 /well) and the cells were finally infected with T. gondii (1:4, cells/parasite ratio) after 24 h, and incubated with different concentrations (25-100 \u00b5g/mL) of UA and SF for 24 h, respectively.
