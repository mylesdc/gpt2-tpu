            "text": "Increasing the intracellular Zn 2+ concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn 2+ and PT at low concentrations (2 mM Zn 2+ and 2 mM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV-thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn 2+ across the plasma membrane-we show that Zn 2+ efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn 2+ directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn 2+ was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn 2+ with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.",

Zn 2+ is probably an important cofactor for numerous viral proteins as well. Nevertheless, the intracellular concentration of free Zn 2+ is maintained at a relatively low level by metallothioneins, likely due to the fact that Zn 2+ can serve as intracellular second messenger and may trigger apoptosis or a decrease in protein synthesis at elevated concentrations [1, 2, 3] . Interestingly, in cell culture studies, high Zn 2+ concentrations and the addition of compounds that stimulate cellular import of Zn 2+ , such as hinokitol (HK), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and pyrithione (PT), were found to inhibit the replication of various RNA viruses, including influenza virus [4] , respiratory syncytial virus [5] and several picornaviruses [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . Although these previous studies provided limited mechanistic information, this suggests that intracellular Zn 2+ levels affect a common step in the replicative cycle of these viruses.",

The replication of segmented negative-strand RNA viruses such as influenza virus, however, does not depend on polyprotein processing and the effect of PDTC-mediated Zn 2+ import was therefore hypothesized to result from inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and cellular cofactors [4] .

We therefore applied this compound to stop and restart the in vitro RNA-synthesizing activity at will. This convenient tool allowed us to study various mechanistic aspects of arteri-and coronavirus RNA synthesis in more detail.

To determine whether Zn 2+ has a similar effect on nidoviruses, we investigated the effect of PT and Zn 2+ on the replication of EAV and SARS-CoV in Vero-E6 cells, using reporter viruses that express green fluorescent proteins (GFP), i.e., EAV-GFP [29] and SARS-CoV-GFP [30] . EAV-GFP encodes an N-terminal fusion of GFP to the viral nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), one of the cleavage products of the replicase polyproteins, and thus provides a direct readout for translation of the replicase gene. In SARS-CoV-GFP, reporter expression occurs from sg mRNA 7, following the replacement of two accessory protein-coding genes (ORFs 7a and 7b) that are dispensable for replication in cell culture.",

The RdRp is commonly embedded in a membrane-associated replication complex that is assembled from viral RNA, and viral and host proteins. Given their crucial function in the viral replicative cycle, RdRps are key targets for antiviral research. Increased intracellular Zn 2+ concentrations are known to efficiently impair replication of a number of RNA viruses, e.g. by interfering with correct proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins. Here, we not only show that corona-and arterivirus replication can be inhibited by increased Zn 2+ levels, but also use both isolated replication complexes and purified recombinant RdRps to demonstrate that this effect may be based on direct inhibition of nidovirus RdRps.

After 30 min, these reactions were split into two aliquots and magnesium-saturated EDTA (MgEDTA) was added to one of the tubes to a final concentration of 1 mM (Fig. 3A ). We used MgEDTA as Zn 2+ chelator in these in vitro assays, because it specifically chelates Zn 2+ while releasing Mg 2+ , due to the higher stability constant of the ZnEDTA complex. Uncomplexed EDTA inhibited RTC activity in all reactions (data not shown), most likely by chelating the Mg 2+ that is crucial for RdRp activity [27, 28] , whereas MgEDTA had no effects on control reactions without Zn 2+ (Fig. 3B , compare lane 1 and 2). As shown in Fig. 2 , the EAV RTC activity that was inhibited by Zn 2+ (Fig. 3B&C , lane 3) could be restored by the addition of MgEDTA (Fig. 3B , lane 4) to a level observed for control reactions without Zn 2+ (Fig. 3B , lane 1). Compared to the untreated control, the EAV RTC assay produced approximately 30% less RNA, which was consistent with the 30% shorter reaction time after the addition of the MgEDTA (100 versus 70 min for lanes 1 and 4, respectively). Surprisingly, SARS-CoV RTC assays that were consecutively supplemented with Zn 2+ and MgEDTA incorporated slightly more [a-32 P]CMP compared to untreated control reactions ( Fig. 3C ; compare lane 1 and 4). This effect was not due to chelation of the Zn 2+ already present in the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) of SARS-CoV-infected cells, as this increase was not observed when MgEDTA was added to a control reaction without additional Zn 2+ (Fig. 3C, lane 2) .

Using an 18-mer polyU template, the EAV RdRp incorporated [a-32 P]AMP into RNA products of up to 18 nt in length (Fig. 4A ). Initiation was de novo, which is in line with previous observations and the presence of a conserved priming loop in the nsp9 sequence [28] . Unlike the EAV RdRp nsp9, the in vitro activity of the SARS-CoV RdRp nsp12 -which lacks a priming loop -was shown to be strictly primer-dependent [27] . Thus, to study the RdRp activity of SARS-CoV nsp12, a primed polyU template was used (Fig. 4B) , thereby allowing us to sample [a-32 P]AMP incorporation as described previously [27] . As specificity controls, we used the previously described SARS-CoV nsp12 mutant D618A [27] , which contains an aspartate to alanine substitution in motif A of the RdRp active site, and EAV nsp9-D445A, in which we engineered an aspartate to alanine substitution at the corresponding site of EAV nsp9 [28, 31] . Both mutant RdRps showed greatly reduced [a-32 P]AMP incorporation in our assays (Fig. 4) , confirming once again that the radiolabeled RNA products derived from nidovirus RdRp activity.",

In fact, compared to other divalent metal ions such Co 2+ and Ca 2+ , which typically bind to amino acid side chains containing oxygen atoms rather than sulfur groups, Zn 2+ was the most efficient inhibitor of SARS-CoV nsp12 RdRp activity (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). To test whether, as in the RTC assay, the RdRp inhibition by zinc ions was reversible, RdRp assays were preincubated with 6 mM Zn 2+ , a concentration that consistently gave .95% inhibition. After 30 min, 8 mM MgEDTA was added to both a control reaction and the reaction inhibited with ZnOAc 2 , and samples were incubated for another 30 min (Fig. 5C ). As shown in Fig. 5D , the inhibition of EAV RdRp activity by Zn 2+ could be reversed by chelation of Zn 2+ (Fig. 5D; compare lanes 3 and 4) . The amount of product synthesized was consistently 6065% of that synthesized in a 60-min control reaction ( Fig. 5D ; compare lanes 1 and 4), which was within the expected range given the shorter reaction time. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV RdRp was reversible as well. During the 30-min incubation after the addition of MgEDTA, SARS-CoV nsp12 incorporated 4065% of the label incorporated during a standard 60-min reaction (Fig. 5E ). This was slightly lower than the expected yield and may be caused by the elevated Mg 2+ concentration, which was shown to be suboptimal for nsp12 activity [27] and results from the release of Mg 2+ from MgEDTA upon chelation of Zn 2+ .",

            "text": "Differential effect of Zn 2+ on the initiation and elongation phase of nidovirus RNA synthesis For EAV, close inspection of the RdRp assays revealed a less pronounced effect of Zn 2+ on the generation of full-length 18-nt products than on the synthesis of smaller reaction intermediates (Fig. 5A ). This suggested that Zn 2+ specifically inhibited the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis. To test this hypothesis, an RTC assay was incubated for 30 min with unlabeled CTP (initiation), after which the reaction was split in two. Then, [a-32 P]CTP was added to both tubes (pulse), 500 mM Zn 2+ was added to one of the tubes, and samples were taken at different time points during the reaction (Fig. 6A ). Fig. 6B shows that in the presence of Zn 2+ [a-32 P]CMP was predominantly incorporated into nascent RNA molecules that were already past the initiation phase at the moment that Zn 2+ was added to the reaction. No new initiation occurred, as was indicated by the smear of short radiolabeled products that progressively shifted up towards the position of full-length genomic RNA. This suggested that Zn 2+ does not affect the elongation phase of EAV RNA synthesis and that it specifically inhibits initiation. This also explains the relatively weak signal intensity of the smaller sg mRNA bands (e.g., compare the relative change in signal of RNA2 to RNA7) produced in the presence of Zn 2+ , since multiple initiation events are required on these short molecules to obtain signal intensities similar to those resulting from a single initiation event on the long genomic RNA, e.g., 16 times more in the case of RNA7. In contrast to EAV, the effect of Zn 2+ on RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV RTCs was not limited to initiation, but appeared to impair the elongation phase as well, given that the addition of Zn 2+ completely blocked further incorporation of [a-32 P]CMP when added 40 min after the start of the reaction (Fig. 6C) .",

            "text": "In the RdRp assays, the short templates used made it technically impossible to do experiments similar to those performed with complete RTCs. However, we previously noticed that at low concentrations of [a-32 P]ATP (,0.17 mM) SARS-CoV nsp12 RdRp activity was restricted to the addition of only a single nucleotide to the primer [27] . EAV nsp9 mainly produced very short (2-3 nt long) abortive RNA products and only a fraction of full length products, as is common for de novo initiating RdRps [28] . This allowed us to separately study the effect of Zn 2+ on initiation and elongation by performing an experiment in which a pulse with a low concentration of [a-32 P]ATP was followed by a chase in the presence of 50 mM of unlabeled ATP, which increased processivity and allowed us to study elongation ( Fig. 7A and C) as described previously [27] . The results of these experiments were in agreement with those obtained with isolated RTCs. For EAV, with initiation and dinucleotide synthesis completely inhibited by the presence of 6 mM Zn 2+ (Supplemental Fig. S2A ), the amount of reaction intermediates shorter than 18 nt diminished with time, while products from templates on which the RdRp had already initiated were elongated to full-length 18-nt molecules (Fig. 7B, right panel) . This was consistent with the observation that the EAV RdRp remained capable of extending the synthetic dinucleotide ApA to trinucleotides in the presence of Zn 2+ (Supplemental Fig. S2B ). Likely due to the absence of reinitiation in the reactions shown in Fig. 7B , the low processivity of the EAV RdRp, and the substrate competition between the remaining [a-32 P]ATP and the .200 fold excess of unlabeled ATP, the differences between the 5-and 30-min time points were small. In the absence of Zn 2+ , the RdRp continued to initiate as indicated by the ladder of smaller-sized RNA molecules below the full-length product (Fig. 7B, left panel) and the time course shown in Supplemental Fig. S2A . In contrast, the addition of Zn 2+ to a SARS-CoV RdRp reaction also blocked elongation, since extension of the radiolabeled primer as observed in the absence of Zn 2+ (Fig. 7D , left panel) no longer occurred (Fig. 7D, right panel) .",

In infections with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Zn 2+ also interfered with some of the replicase polyproteins cleavages [24] , albeit at a much higher concentration (100 mM Zn 2+ ) than used in our studies. Since impaired replicase processing will indirectly affect viral RNA synthesis in the infected cell, we used two recently developed in vitro assays to investigate whether Zn 2+ also affects nidovirus RNA synthesis directly. Our in vitro studies revealed a strong inhibitory effect of zinc ions on the RNAsynthesizing activity of isolated EAV and SARS-CoV RTCs. Assays with recombinant enzymes subsequently demonstrated that this was likely due to direct inhibition of RdRp function. The inhibitory effect could be reversed by chelating the zinc ions, which provides an interesting experimental (on/off) approach to study nidovirus RNA synthesis. Addition of Zn 2+ following initiation of EAV RNA synthesis had little or no effect on NTP incorporation in molecules whose synthesis had already been initiated in the absence of Zn 2+ (Fig. 6 and 7) , indicating that Zn 2+ does not affect elongation and does not increase the termination frequency, as was previously found for Mn 2+ [25] . Therefore, Zn 2+ appears to be a specific inhibitor of the initiation phase of EAV RNA synthesis. In contrast, Zn 2+ inhibited SARS-CoV RdRp activity also during the elongation phase of RNA synthesis, probably by directly affecting template binding (Fig. 8) . In coronaviruses, zinc ions thus appear to inhibit both the proper proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins [23, 24] and RdRp activity (this study). Contrary to the RTC assays, millimolar instead of micromolar concentrations of ZnOAc 2 were required for a nearly complete inhibition of nucleotide incorporation in RdRp assays.",

Zinc-binding domains commonly consist of at least three conserved cysteine and/or histidine residues within a stretch of ,10-30 amino acids, such as in zinc-finger motifs and metalloproteases [2, 40, 41] . However, in RdRps there are only few precedents for the presence of zinc-binding pockets, such as those identified in the crystal structure of the Dengue RdRp [42] . Sequence analysis of the EAV nsp9 amino acid sequence revealed that it lacks patches rich in conserved cysteines and/or histidines. In contrast, inspection of the SARS-CoV nsp12 amino acid sequence revealed two such patches, namely H295-C301-C306-H309-C310 and C799-H810-C813-H816. A crystal structure for nsp12 is presently unavailable, but a predicted structure that represents the C-terminal two-thirds of the enzyme has been published [31] . Interestingly, in this model, C799, H810, C813 and H816 are in a spatial arrangement resembling that of the Zn 2+ Figure 7 . The effect of Zn 2+ on initiation and elongation activity of purified EAV and SARS-CoV RdRps. (A) An EAV RdRp reaction was initiated in the presence of [a-32 P]ATP under conditions that do not allow elongation, i.e., low ATP concentration. After 20 min, the reaction was split into two equal volumes, and Zn 2+ was added to one of the tubes.

Clearly, an in-depth analysis of nidovirus RdRps, e.g. through structural analysis and subsequent mutational studies targeting aforementioned cysteines and histidines, is required to provide further insight into and a structural basis for the Zn 2+ -induced inhibitory effects on RdRp activity documented in this study. Such studies may, however, be complicated when Zn 2+ binding proves to be very transient in nature and not detectable with currently available methods.",

The nsp9-containing fraction was further purified by gel filtration in 20 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20 on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing nsp9-CH were pooled, dialyzed against 1000 volumes of buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 50% glycerol) and stored at 220uC.

(A) Sequence alignment of coronavirus RdRps showing conservation of four potential zinc-binding residues amino acids (C799-H810-C813-H816 in SARS-CoV; indicated with asterisks) in the C-terminal region of coronavirus nsp12. Black shading indicates complete conservation among coronaviruses. The coronavirus RdRp sequences were aligned with Muscle 3.6. The aligned sequences and NCBI accession numbers are the following: mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV_A59; NP_068668), human CoV 229E (HCoV_229E; NP_068668), infectious bronchitis virus strain Beaudette (IBV_B; P0C6Y1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV; NP_742138.1), feline coronavirus (FeCoV; YP_239353.1), and SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt-1 (SARS_Fr1; AAP33696). (B) Crystal structure of the Dengue virus RdRp domain showing the position of four cysteine and histidine residues that form Zn 2+ -binding pocket Zn2, located close to motif E (depicted in red). A second Zn 2+ -binding pocket (Zn1) and the two zinc ions identified in the crystal structure are indicated in blue-gray. (C) Predicted three-dimensional structure model of SARS-CoV nsp12 (Xu et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31: 7117-7130), based on PDB code 1O5S, rendered with Swiss-PdbViewer 4.01 and POV-Ray 3.6. The positions of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues indicated in panel A (C799-H810-C813-H816) close to motif E (depicted in red) and RdRp active-site residues (D618, D760 and D761) are indicated. The spatial arrangement of these cysteines and histidines in this model strikingly resembles the positioning of the metal ion-coordinating residues of Zn-binding pocket Zn2 in the Dengue virus RdRp domain (see panel B).
