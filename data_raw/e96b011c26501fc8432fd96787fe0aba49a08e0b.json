No licensed vaccines were available before the epidemic and there is no established, specific treatment for EVD, which permitted its initial growth to be nearly exponential [2] . The disease posed a substantial risk of global spread during its early growth phase, and thus, the risk of observing substantial number of deaths. The majority of preventative measures to reduce EVD transmission have been limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, as well as entry and exit screening at borders.",

The WHO described the unfolding EVD epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014. The declaration aimed to strengthen surveillance and monitoring of the virus on a global scale, including in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The WHO has never recommended travel restrictions to delay or prevent the international spread of EVD [4] . Nevertheless, unlike past epidemics of other infectious diseases, and perhaps because of the rapid geographic spread of EVD to cities with international airports, including Nigeria, a substantial number of countries at risk have adopted national policies to respond to the risk of EVD importation at borders. The restrictions ranged from partial cancellation of international flights to full closure of international borders, particularly in countries that belong to the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO). These large scale travel restrictions were implemented based on individual decisions of member countries.",

A comparative study of entry and exit screening for EVD emphasized that the cost-effectiveness of entry screening among all incoming travelers at risk is likely to be limited, and argued that exit screening in affected countries would be more beneficial [12] . Another large-scale simulation study offered rapid feedback with respect to the delay effect of the EVD epidemic attributable to travel restrictions, estimating that travel restrictions led to a delay of EVD outbreaks for approximately 30 days in AFRO countries [13] . Moreover, a report issued by the World Bank quantified the economic impact of the 2013-16 EVD epidemic, indicating that there was negative economic growth in affected countries in 2015 [14] .",

In fact, the importance of accounting for socioeconomic predictors has been highlighted in epidemic modeling studies [17] and should be explicitly tested using empirical data. Employing a simplistic hazard-based regression approach, travel-associated risks and contact behaviors could be modelled in combination with measures of these cultural risk factors. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions, in all countries, that occurred from August to September 2014, using a simple statistical model and exploring additional explanatory variables of the risk of EVD importation.",

As the shortest path dominantly predicts the most likely global spread of infectious diseases, the effective distance appeared to be an excellent predictor of arrival time (i.e. the time from emergence to importation of a novel infectious disease) [24] . The validity of predictive performance of the effective distance has been theoretically and empirically argued by Brockmann and Helbing [24] with reference to the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (H1N1-2009). Moreover, the effective distance has been repeatedly used for other application areas including the real time forecasting of the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika virus [25, 26] . Among a total of 227 countries, three affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) were grouped into one geographic unit, and subsequently the effective distance from this amalgamated unit to the rest of the 224 countries was calculated.",

That is, as part of the evacuation procedure for medical treatment purposes, those working on the ground and who were infected, especially infected physicians and healthcare workers, were admitted to a hospital in their home country. Therefore, we analyzed two different datasets for arrival time; one that included all countries with importation and one that excluded countries that intentionally imported cases for treatment purposes. Epidemiological assessment of travel restrictions was conducted by calculating the cumulative risk of importation for each country and comparing estimates in two scenarios. Since the hazard is assumed as constant before and after travel restrictions, the cumulative risk of importation is given by one minus the cumulative risk of escaping importation for the period of t a and t b -t a days.

In particular, the present study is the first to conveniently use the effective distance in evaluating the effectiveness of travel restrictions using existing empirical data. When we analyzed arrival time data from July to September 2014, during which local preventative measures had yet to be deemed successful, all the models showed that travel restrictions resulted in very small estimates of absolute risk reduction (< 1%) and a relative risk reduction of approximately 20%. The effectiveness of travel restrictions tended to be greatest among AFRO countries, which instituted travel restrictions earliest between August and September 2014. The European countries had the lowest estimated effectiveness, but this is expected because of high connectivity with African countries by air transportation, the acceptance of medical evacuation for international aid workers and their historical context. Full cancellation of flights with affected countries did not increase the overall effectiveness of travel restrictions (Fig 4B and 4D ). This could be due to clusters of flights to countries that have not refused international travelers from source countries. This study highlights that travel restrictions were not as effective as anticipated. As implicated in a large-scale simulation study of travel restrictions [13] , an epidemic cannot be prevented with travel restrictions. Further, this very limited effectiveness has been consistently indicated by extensive modeling studies of pandemic preparedness planning [31, 32] . Preventative measures at borders may be effective in conjunction with concerted control efforts, including improvement in awareness of the epidemic's current situation among the public. Rather than expecting border control to be effective, it is better to give priority to locally controlling the spread of disease upon emergence [32, 33] . Although the international spread of EVD was limited from 2013-16, our results imply that limited global spread is attributable to successful local control, mainly in the three affected countries, since the effective reproductive number for all three affected countries had fallen to value close to 1 by late September 2014. These effective local interventions included health system strengthening, construction of healthcare facilities, contact tracing efforts and safe burial measures at source [28, 34] .",

We have shown that, when a strong correlation exists between the effective distance and arrival time, the effectiveness of travel restrictions can be quantified, even without employing a metapopulation-based epidemic model. Namely, without realizing the epidemic dynamics, the hazard-based model was shown to be useful for evaluating travel restrictions. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to apply the concept of effective distance to evaluate preventative measures against the global spread of EVD. Although the precision of our findings may be less than those of simulation studies reported elsewhere [8, 11, 13] , the present approach captures the key contribution of air travel to the time and risk of importation.",

In the case of EVD, the total number of imported countries was very small, and rather than strictly selecting variables with practical (or causal) explanations, it is possible that a few variables that simply statistically improved the goodness-of-fit might have been selected. For this reason, we have also estimated the effectiveness using only the effective distance, throughout the present study. The predictive performance is expected to be improved by selecting truly insightful variables and specific countries particularly at-risk of importation, therefore the present study has shown the potential approaches to exploring epidemiological predictors of importation risk in addition to airline transportation network data.",

This approach could have underestimated the risk of importation in West African countries, especially in countries that share borders with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Second, our network data were imperfect. The dataset was built on direct connecting flights and the degree was determined by the number of flight routes (i.e. not based on the number of passengers). Rather than overcoming these limitations in the network data, greater weight was given to the use of simple open source data [26, 35] ; however, we believe that using flight route data in our approach was well justified in the context of regression-based modeling using the effective distance. Third, previous studies based on airline transportation network data have used the incorrect assumption that the infected, exporting individual is randomly selected from a source country [36] . Although this assumption was not overcome in the present study, it should be noted that our approach will be able to partially address that assumption by adding key predictive data, such as socioeconomic strata.",

The relative risk reduction resulting from travel restrictions was estimated to be approximately 20%; this was not considered a substantial risk reduction to prevent the global epidemic of EVD. Our study highlights the need to strengthen local capacities for disease monitoring and control, rather than relying heavily on border control [37, 38] . In addition to local capacity-building and preparedness, we also suggest that rapid local containment should be achieved through coordinated and expedited international cooperation, especially in capacity-limited settings, as was the case with the EVD epidemic [39] [40] [41] .
