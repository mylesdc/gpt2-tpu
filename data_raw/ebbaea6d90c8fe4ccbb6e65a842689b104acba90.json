However, the exact role of lipid rafts in the cellular membrane during the entry of IBV into host cells is still unknown. In this study, we biochemically fractionated IBV-infected cells via sucrose density gradient centrifugation after depleting plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin or Mevastatin. Our results demonstrated that unlike IBV non-structural proteins, IBV structural proteins co-localized with lipid raft marker caveolin-1. Infectivity assay results of Vero cells illustrated that the drug-induced disruption of lipid rafts significantly suppressed IBV infection. Further studies revealed that lipid rafts were not required for IBV genome replication or virion release at later stages. However, the drug-mediated depletion of lipid rafts in Vero cells before IBV attachment significantly reduced the expression of viral structural proteins, suggesting that drug treatment impaired the attachment of IBV to the cell surface. Our results indicated that lipid rafts serve as attachment factors during the early stages of IBV infection, especially during the attachment stage.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which includes many human and animal pathogens of global concern, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and mouse hepatitis virus(MHV) [1] . IBV has a major economic impact on the global poultry industry because this prototype coronavirus considerably decreases hen egg production by impairing the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts of chickens [2] . IBV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a 27-30 kb genome that encodes several polyproteins. The polyproteins of IBV a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 are cleaved by viral proteases into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) [3] . Four structural proteins, namely, spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), and small envelope protein (E), are encoded by subgenomic RNA species [4] . The binding and entry of IBV into host cells require interactions between cellular surface receptors and viral structural proteins that are involved in the attachment stage. Nearly all IBV field isolates can only be propagated in embryonated chicken eggs or transiently proliferated in primary chicken embryo kidney cells. However, the Beaudette strain, a cell-adapted strain, replicates efficiently in various cultured mammalian cell lines, including African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human liver cancer cells, lung cancer cell lines, and baby hamster kidney cells through serial passages [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, the detailed mechanism underlying virus-host interactions during viral attachment and entry remains uninvestigated. Here, we used the Beaudette strain as an in vitro model to study the mechanism of IBV infection.",

Specific microdomains exist in biological membranes; however, the existence of lipid rafts in living cells still remains controversial [11] . Lipid rafts are involved in some important cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell migration, and axonal guidance [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition, numerous studies have revealed that lipid rafts are important during viral infection. For example, lipid rafts are critical in multiple stages of the life cycles of dengue and hepatitis C viruses [16] . Furthermore, lipid rafts are involved in the binding and entry of host cells for several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus [17] , poliovirus [18] , human herpes virus 6 [19] , West Nile virus [20] , footand-mouth disease virus [21] , and simian virus 40 [22] . Moreover, lipid rafts are involved in the assembly and egress of some viruses, including rotavirus, measles virus, Newcastle disease virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Some studies showed that drugmediated cholesterol depletion inhibited human coronavirus 229E and MHV entry into host cells [27, 28] . In a previous study, we reported that lipid rafts are crucial for SARS-CoV entry into Vero E6 cells [29] . Moreover, changes in the lipid component of cellular membranes affect the outcome of IBV infection [30, 31] . Intriguingly, the efficiency of IBV-induced membrane fusion considerably varies among different cell lines. In this study, we investigated the direct role of lipid rafts during IBV infection in Vero cells. Lipid rafts were disrupted by depleting cellular cholesterol with two pharmacological agents, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) and Mevastatin. The results showed that the structural proteins of IBV are required for attachment to Vero cells. However, lipid rafts may not be involved in the replication and release of IBV. These results revealed that lipid rafts are required during the early stages of IBV infection.",

However, M\u03b2CD treatment considerably reduced the amounts of IBV structural proteins, including E, N, and S, in fractions 3-5. By contrast, the IBV NSP5 and NSP12 did not co-fractionate with the lipid rafts (Fig 1) .

As shown in Fig 3A, IBV N protein was detectable in whole cell lysates (WCL) until 12 hpi. Notably, the expression levels of IBV N protein in the WCL and the supernatants significantly decreased after M\u03b2CD treatment compared with the control, especially at 12-18 hpi in the WCL. Moreover, the ratio of IBV N protein in the WCL and supernatants was similar for treated and untreated infected cells.

Similarly, Mevastatin treatment also significantly and simultaneously decreased viral N protein levels both in the WCL and the supernatants.

IBV RNA copies were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with specific primers. The RNA level represents the IBV genome copies after IBV replication. Fig 4A and 4B show that RNA copies, including negative-strand genomic RNA (gRNA) and negative and positive subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the viral RNA levels increased over time after IBV infection. Notably, both gRNA and sgRNA exhibited rapid increases in RNA levels regardless of drug treatment, indicating that drug-induced lipid raft disruption could not suppress IBV viral genome replication. The RNA levels of drug-treated Vero cells decreased at each time point after IBV infection compared with the control, suggesting that drug treatment may affect IBV virion entry into cells during the early stages of infection. These results demonstrated that lipid rafts may function in the early stages of virion entry into cells, but do not affect viral genome replication.",

To further study the participation of lipid rafts in the early stages of viral infection, as well as to identify the specific involvement of lipid rafts in viral endocytosis, lipid rafts were inactivated with M\u03b2CD. To determine the role of lipid rafts in IBV attachment, host cells were pre-treated with M\u03b2CD for 1 h at 4\u02daC, incubated with IBV for 1 h at 4\u02daC, and then incubated at 37\u02daC for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. To determine the role of lipid rafts in IBV entry, host cells were pre-incubated with IBV for 1 h at 4\u02daC, treated with M\u03b2CD for 1 h at 4\u02daC, and then cultured at 37\u02daC for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. Vero cells without the M\u03b2CD treatment were set as the control. To assess viral replication, IBV N protein was subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig 5A, IBV N was detectable in the control group with increasing hpi. M\u03b2CD treatment decreased IBV N levels compared with that of the control group. In particular, M\u03b2CD treatment prior to IBV attachment significantly repressed IBV N expression. This result suggested that M\u03b2CD treatment blocked viral particles from binding with the cell membrane. To further confirm the function of lipid rafts in IBV endocytosis, the IBV-susceptible cell lines A549 and DF1 were treated with M\u03b2CD before or after IBV attachment (Fig 5B and 5C ). The depletion of lipid rafts by M\u03b2CD suppressed IBV N expression in both cell lines when cells were treated with M\u03b2CD before IBV attachment. However, this result was not observed when cells received M\u03b2CD treatment after IBV attachment. These results indicated that M\u03b2CD treatment directly inhibited IBV attachment and that drug-induced lipid raft disruption mainly blocked IBV attachment to host cells. Therefore, lipid rafts are crucial to virus endocytosis and are required for IBV attachment.",

            "text": "IBV is a prototype avian coronavirus that belongs to the genus Gamma-coronavirus. It is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. Its envelope contains the major attachment spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M), and the minor envelope protein (E). The spikes are composed of S protein trimers, which are necessary for viral attachment and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Therefore, the IBV S protein and other structural proteins likely interact with lipid rafts. These direct or indirect interactions can affect the infection cycle of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we performed several experiments to determine the function of lipid rafts in IBV infection. Our data showed that IBV structural proteins co-localized with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane and that IBV structural proteins remain localized with the GM1 protein. In addition, the drug-induced disruption of lipid rafts in Vero cells inhibited IBV infection, which likely occurred because lipid rafts are involved in viral attachment. These results indicated that lipid rafts in the cellular surface may mediate viral adhesion to facilitate IBV endocytosis.",

Lipid rafts, as attachment factors, may promote viral entry into cells. Although our study confirmed the role of lipid raft in IBV infection, the fate of endocytosed IBV remains unclear. Previous studies found that IBV internalization is mediated via macropinocytosis, in which lipid rafts transit through early endosomes to the recycling endosomes and then back to the cell surface to form new adhesions [41, 42] . Meanwhile, in micropinocytosis, pathogen-host interactions change the downstream signaling network to modify membrane traffic and cytoskeletal dynamics to meet each other's requirements. It is likely that pathogen-host interactions promote lipid raft clustering and focal adhesion formation during endocytosis. The internalized IBV will also be transferred from early endosomes to later endosomes. Although the present study primarily focused on lipid rafts and its role in the early stages of viral infection, the significance of the involvement of lipid rafts in IBV entry goes beyond this molecule. Moreover, further studies should investigate whether protein molecules in lipid rafts serve as a signaling platform to activate downstream kinases and cellular adhesive formation.",
