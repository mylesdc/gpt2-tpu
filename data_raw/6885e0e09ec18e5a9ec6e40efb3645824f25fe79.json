We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome.

            "text": "On May 8, 2018 , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the occurrence of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). [1] From April 4 through May 7, 21 suspected EVD cases were reported in Iboko and Bikoro, \u00c9quateur Province. On May 7, blood samples from five hospitalized patients had been sent to Kinshasa for Ebola-PCR testing, and two were confirmed PCR-positive. [2] On May 21, vaccination of healthcare workers started. [3] By May 27, the ring vaccination campaign was being rolled out as 906 contacts and contacts of contacts were being actively monitored. Six suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed EVD cases had been reported, and 25 (52%) of 48 probable and confirmed EVD cases had died. [1] This outbreak had several features that were worrisome for widespread transmission. Cases were reported over a 168-kilometer distance, including four confirmed cases in th\u1ebd 1,200,000-inhabitant provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, which is situated on the Congo River and bordering Congo-Brazzaville. [2] Moreover, travel to Kinshasa is frequent from Mbandaka. Given these risk factors, early epidemic growth profiles, [4] and evidence of unreported infection from previous outbreaks, [5, 6] the risk of a substantially larger outbreak could not be ignored.",

Delayed detection of EVD outbreaks and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth. [7] In addition to traditional burial practices, Ebola treatment units with low quality care and/or high mortality rates have discouraged Ebola suspects from presenting to care and contribute to community-based transmission. [8] [9] [10] Fragile, overwhelmed public health surveillance systems have also contributed to higher rates of unreported cases, who endanger urban communities, [11] which potentially have had higher transmission rates than rural communities. [12] Change to subcritical transmission (reproduction number below 1) tends to occur when Ebola response organizations deploy control, prevention and care measures, [13, 14] communities adopt more protective behaviors, [15, 16] and/or transmission decreases in a social network. [17, 18] Scientific advances with rapid diagnostics and vaccines from the West Africa outbreak were deployed in the April-July 2018 EVD outbreak in DRC and had the potential to limit Ebola virus transmission. [19] [20] [21] We used reported case counts during EVD outbreak in DRC and/or time series from 18 prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without the use of vaccines. These projections were intended to help organizations anticipate and allocate sufficient resources for the duration of the April-July 2018 EVD outbreak.",

During the outbreak, the Ebola response team tested suspected cases for EVD and depending on positive or negative results, cases were classified as confirmed or not a case. The final outbreak case count was 54 probable and confirmed cases (no suspected cases).

[25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] As there is a difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD following a country's first outbreak, we employed this inclusion criterion to reflect the Ebola response system in DRC during what is now its ninth outbreak. The Wallinga-Teunis technique was used to estimate R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in the outbreak. [33] The serial interval was defined as the interval between disease onset in an index case and disease onset in a person infected by that index case. The serial interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days. [11, [34] [35] [36] Given that serial interval distribution, which we can denote as a probability w (t) of a t-day interval between given primary and secondary cases, Wallinga-Teunis estimation works by defining a relative likelihood p ij for each possible source j of a given case i:",

After the Ministry of Health and WHO conducted epidemiological investigations about the beginning of the EVD outbreak in \u00c9quateur Province, they concluded that the outbreak began on April 4, 2018, with a single case. [1] The simulation process occurs as follows: proposed epidemic trajectories are generated in an initial step based on the above branching process, and these are then subsequently filtered by discarding all but those whose cumulative case counts match the known counts of the April-July 2018 EVD outbreak on known dates. The filtration accepts epidemics within a range of 3 cases more or less than each recorded value. This one-step particle filtering technique produced an ensemble of model outbreaks, filtered on agreement with the recorded trajectory of the outbreak to date. This filtered ensemble is then used to generate projections of the eventual outcome of the outbreak. [12] To model vaccination coverage with respect to total transmission (unreported and reported), we multiplied the estimate of vaccine effectiveness by low and high estimates of reported cases. In a ring vaccination study at the end of the West Africa outbreak, the overall estimated rVSV-vectored vaccine efficacy was 100% and vaccine effectiveness was 64.6% in protecting all contacts and contacts of contacts from EVD in the randomized clusters, including unvaccinated cluster members. [20] Estimates of vaccine effectiveness were used in our stochastic model. The ring vaccination study found the vaccine to be effective against cases with onset dates 10 days or more from the date of vaccine administration, so we modeled the vaccination program as a proportionate reduction in the number of new cases with onsets 10 days or more after the program start date.",

Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine effectiveness (64.6%), a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% multiplied by 64.6%) and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% multiplied by 64.6%).

For simulation based on probable, confirmed, and suspected cases, from 122,683,392 simulated outbreaks, 32,431 were retained after filtering.

In the April-July 2018 outbreak, we observed cases over the period from April 4 to May 27 (day 0 to day 53). May 27 corresponded to day 34 since reaching 10 reported cases. For the prior 18 outbreaks, linear interpolation was used to obtain the number of cases on day 34 (after reaching 10 cases). To reduce the influence of outliers and high leverage points, and to improve linearity, we calculated the pseudologarithm transform f(x) = arcsinh(x/2), asymptotically logarithmic but well-behaved at 0. We used nonparametric Theil-Sen regression (R-package mblm) followed by calculation of the resulting prediction interval for a new observation. [46, 47] Finally, we reported the median and 95% central coverage intervals for the prediction distribution conditional on the value being no smaller than the observed value on day 34. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using ordinary least squares regression. These analyses were conducted using R 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

[52, 53] Our projections that included suspected cases did not suggest that vaccines had as much of an impact as our model using only probable and confirmed cases. The trends associated with suspected cases were subject to several factors, including operational choices of response teams and maturity of the outbreak. Nevertheless, suspected case counts may at times provide a better glimpse into the near future of an outbreak than the confirmed and probable case counts. In our case, use of the time series of confirmed, probable, and suspect cases yielded a forecast closer to the final outbreak size. However, as model projections can be highly sensitive to inclusion of suspected cases and use of exact case counts, particularly the last few counts in the available data, conclusions must be taken with caution.",

Mean, median and 95% prediction interval of outbreak duration, by proportion of vaccine coverage, using probable and confirmed cases with and without suspected cases. There are limitations to our projections. Projection distributions were right-skewed, with long tails (and we therefore reported the median instead of the mean). While there have been 22 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten cases, we were unable to include all prior outbreaks in our estimates due to data availability. [45, 54] Note that the simple regression projection is based entirely on past outbreaks of EVD (measured and reported in different ways), and cannot account for the improved control measures and vaccination in the way that a mechanistic model does. We included, however, as much real-time information into our estimates as possible, but situations such as the introduction of EVD into a large urban population and implementation of RDTs and vaccines are new to DRC. We did not include vaccination of healthcare workers in the stochastic model. Our estimates of vaccination effectiveness and reported cases were obtained from West Africa because these estimates were not available for the EVD outbreak in \u00c9quateur. These modeling assumptions may not have been consistent with estimates in DRC and should be carefully considered prior to use in other EVD outbreaks.",

            "text": "A strength of our approach was the use of multiple methods to estimate the outbreak size, although we note that Gott's Law has not been validated for outbreak projections in other EVD outbreaks. Additional limitations of the models were that they did not include parameters to address spatial spread, urban settings, conflict zone, or other factors that may have influenced the accuracy of the predictions, particularly in the 2018-2019 EVD outbreak in Northeastern DRC (ongoing in January 2019). While it can also be useful and achievable to use models of these kinds to make short-term forecasts for evaluation of model performance and to inform outbreak response, [55] the present study was limited to projections of final outbreak size and duration. Among our three mathematical models, the model that performed the best (stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage) predicted total outbreak sizes close to the true outcome. When EVD cases were introduced into Mbandaka, there was concern that the total outbreak size could exceed most prior EVD outbreaks in DRC. Indeed, our projections were consistent with this concern because models without vaccine coverage projected higher total outbreak sizes. In our stochastic model projections, vaccine use reduced mean total outbreak size by more than half, regardless of coverage levels (p<0.001, Welch's t-test). As vaccine coverage was scaled up, an influx of support was warranted to support and bolster the evolving rapid response; however, continued efforts to strengthen the health system are equally as warranted so that we can respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.",
