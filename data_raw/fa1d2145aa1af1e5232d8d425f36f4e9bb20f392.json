            "text": "Children and adults residing in densely populated urban centers around the world are at risk of seasonal influenza-like illness caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In a large metropolitan of Thailand's capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September). These findings support the utility of rapid nucleic acid testing of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in patients with ILI. Agapov E, Sumino KC, Gaudreault-Keener M, Storch GA, Holtzman MJ. 2006.

No cross-detections were observed between the two viruses and other respiratory viruses including influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus.

Two multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used to rapidly detect three of the most common viral respiratory pathogens. It was not surprising that influenza was the most prevalent virus (17.3%), followed by RSV (11.4%) and hMPV (3.6%). Similar to our findings, previous study examining hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Thailand found that influenza viruses were the most common respiratory viruses diagnosed among ILI cases (Chittaganpitch et al., 2018) . RSV prevalence was highest among children aged <5 years with rates of infection between 15.4 and 21.2%. On the other hand, RSV had a lower burden of symptomatic respiratory illness among older children and adults, and the opposite trend was observed for influenza virus infection. The proportion of patients with influenza virus infections increased with age, and the rate of infection was greatest in children 13-18 years of age (27.2%). These findings are supported by previously reported studies on the epidemiology of respiratory virus infection (Zhang et al., 2014; Richter et al., 2016) .",

Although Thailand is located geographically in the northern hemisphere, the seasonality of respiratory infection is similar to that of several nearby tropical settings such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Southern hemisphere countries of Australia and New Zealand (Weber, Mulholland & Greenwood, 1998; Paynter et al., 2015) . In these regions, respiratory infections generally peak in the rainy season and declines during the hot and dry months. Moreover, a study from Bangladesh found an increased risk of respiratory infection following rainy days, suggesting a link between rainfall and population crowding or proximity (Murray et al., 2012) . In Thailand, the period when students are in school overlaps with the rainy season, so it is possible that host behavior is associated with an increased risk of respiratory infection.",

Several previous studies including from our group have reported Hirsh et al., 2014; Fall et al., 2016; Auksornkitti et al., 2014; Thongpan et al., 2017) . It has been hypothesized that the periodic shifts in the predominant RSV subgroup are driven by the dynamics of population immunity and subgroup-specific herd immunity (Botosso et al., 2009) . Regarding the relationship between clinical severity of infection and RSV types and subtypes, some studies have observed that RSV group A infection was associated with an increased illness severity (McConnochie et al., 1990; Jafri et al., 2013) , while other studies observed that RSV group B infection resulted in more severe disease (Hornsleth et al., 1998; Tran et al., 2013) . In the present study, the emerging genotypes of ON1 and BA9 completely replaced the previous genotypes, such NA1, and other BA genotypes as was found in other countries (Dapat et al., 2010; Esposito et al., 2015) , although it has been observed that they do not appear to cause more severe disease than other genotypes (Panayiotou et al., 2014) . Phylogenetic analysis of the hMPV F gene in the present study showed that both A and B types co-circulated in Thailand over the two-year study period. Similar to our findings, all three subtypes of hMPV (A2, B1, and B2) co-circulated each year in other studies, including South Korea, Italy, Australia, and Norway (Gerna et al., 2005; Mackay et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2008; Moe et al., 2017) . Although hMPV genotype A might be more virulent than genotype B (Vicente et al., 2006) , data in the literature on the association between clinical symptoms and hMPV genotype remains unclear as some authors show a higher severity of illness, (Vicente et al., 2006; Arnott et al., 2013) , while others did not (Agapov et al., 2006; Manoha et al., 2007) . Furthermore, the prevalence of mostly influenza A H3N2 contrasts with the limited circulation of influenza B during this two-year study period. The predominance of influenza A H3N2 in 2016 was observed both in Thailand (Suntronwong et al., 2017) and the United States (Blanton et al., 2017) .",

A small number of individuals had dual infections, most commonly RSV and influenza A H3N2. Due to overlapping seasonal occurrence of these viral infections, accurate and rapid molecular detection can potentially assist clinicians and researchers in the treatment and surveillance to limit viral spread. The data presented here add to our understanding of the epidemiology of RSV, hMPV, and influenza causing respiratory illness in Thailand.",
