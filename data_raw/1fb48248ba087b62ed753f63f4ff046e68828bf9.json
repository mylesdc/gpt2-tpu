Regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections [14, 15] ; unfortunately, achieving effective hand washing practices in schools is difficult [16, 17] . Barriers include inadequate time, insufficient soap or paper towels, and inconveniently located sinks [18] [19] [20] . Assessment of schools' physical environments has provided mixed results. A 1998 report of elementary school restrooms in the mid-Atlantic found that 66% of soap dispensers were nonfunctional or insufficiently filled and 33% of automatic hand dryers were inoperable [21] . A 2009 study of primary and secondary school restrooms in New Mexico reported that soap and hand drying were available in 90% of restrooms; however, hand sanitizer was reported in fewer than 2% [22] .",

Use of hand sanitizer in the home has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in children and respiratory illnesses among family members [16, 27] . Despite these findings, a review by Meadows and Le Saux [28] did not find sufficient evidence to specifically recommend hand sanitizer use in general or among children with asthma; however, a review by Jefferson et al.

To control for school variation and to minimize cross-contamination, individual schools served as the unit of randomization. Crossover between intervention and placebo schools occurred during the summer break between the first and second year. There were two major advantages of the crossover design. The first was the ability to control for the strong seasonal variation in respiratory illnesses that was expected. The second was the ability to maximize school support and participation because all schools would eventually receive the intervention instead of some being relegated to a nonintervention control group.",

There was considerable fear that hand washing alone was not sufficient to prevent 'the spread of germs'. This perception was reinforced by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreak in several schools prior to the study. Because of these concerns, hand sanitizer use increased dramatically such that many schools required parents to purchase personal hand sanitizer as a supply item. Despite reassurance by the local health department that hand washing remained the best option for hand hygiene, community perceptions were so strong that a hand washing only arm was no longer a viable option.",

Our goal was to maintain the scientific integrity of the study while adapting to safety concerns and changes in the community's preferences. Chronologically, the first major decision involved the change from the original hand sanitizer with its corresponding placebo to an alcohol-based product without one. While the safety concerns that prompted this decision were mostly theoretical, we agreed that ensuring participant safety, especially among children, warranted erring on the side of caution. The principal investigator and key study personnel made this decision in close collaboration with the NHLBI project officer and DSMB over the course of multiple teleconferences. The primary goal was to ensure that the redesigned study addressed an important research question using a methodologically rigorous design without compromising student safety. The school system administration (superintendent and chief nursing officer) were appraised of the rationale for the proposed changes and were asked to approve them prior to implementation.",

By supplying the education and resources to ensure that the barriers to effective hand hygiene in the intervention schools were eliminated, we were able to evaluate the best possible hand hygiene practice (hand washing plus hand sanitizer use) against a variety of usual care practices. Unfortunately, the study no longer can measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use directly as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices.
