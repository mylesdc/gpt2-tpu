Each of the 9 virus aliquots titer 10 8 TCID 50 (3 for each strain) were exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00b0C for 15, 30, and 45 min. Similarly, another 15 aliquots (5 for each strain) contain 1 mm depth of the exposed samples in petri-dish was exposed to UV light (252.7 nm wavelength: One foot distance) for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. Different doses of gamma radiation (10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 KGy) were applied in a dose rate 0.551 Gy/s for each strain and repeated 6 times for each dose. FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) were inactivated when exposed to heat \u226557\u00b0C for 15 min. The UV inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2) was obtained within 60 min and 65 min for type A/Iran05. The ideal dose for inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) with gamma radiation were 55-60 and 45 kGy, respectively. Inactivation of FMDV with binary was 20, 24 and 16 hr for O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively while inactivation by (BEI+FA) was determined after 18, 19 and 11 hr for O/pan-Asia, A/Iran 05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively. The antigenicity of control virus before inactivation was 1/32, it was not changed after inactivation in case of gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) and slightly decrease to 1/16 in case of binary and declined to 1/2, 1/4 in case of heat and UV inactivation, respectively. The immune response induced by inactivated FMD vaccines by gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) lasted to 9 months post-vaccination, while the binary only still up to 8 months post-vaccination but heat and UV-inactivated vaccines were not effective.",

Temperature treatment of FMDV at 37\u00b0C for 15, 30, and 45 min had an undetectable effect on FMDV serotype (O/ pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012). These results came parallel to that mentioned by Razdan et al. [37] who recorded that infectivity titers of FMD \"O\" virus in maintenance cell culture medium was reduced by 2 log units on storage at 37\u00b0C for 12 h. It indicates that virus temperature interaction time at 37\u00b0C has an inverse effect on the virus infectivity. Heat treatments at 57\u00b0C and 77\u00b0C for a period of 15 min or longer time are suitable for complete inactivation of the virus. Heat treatment at 60\u00b0C inactivated FMD virus [38, 39] . Heating the virus suspension at 56\u00b0C for 60 min reduces its infectivity [40] . At high temperature, may be done the destruction of virus receptors, which ultimately declined its infectivity. The \"O,\" \"C,\" and \"Asia-1\" serotypes of FMD virus may inactivated at 54\u00b0C for 1 h [41] . The UV light had no effect on the virus after interaction time of 15, 30, and 45 min and the virus produced CPE on BHK cell line. The inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2/2012) occurs within 60 min and 65 min for type (A). Our findings are in aligned with Nuanualsuwan et al. [21] and Rabia et al. [42] who observed that vesicular stomatitis and FMDV were inactivated when exposed to UV light source. These findings are not in aligned with Hazem [43] who mentioned that the virus had resistant properties to UV light.",
