[1] [2] [3] [4] A few population-level studies in Europe were based on observations in one respiratory season only (the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) in which the annually recurring influenza epidemic occurred relatively early. With the occurrence of several early influenza A seasons in recent years, an exploration of longer time trends of different viruses was considered useful to gain more insight in the suggested relationship between circulating viruses. Understanding viral shifts and potential drivers thereof is relevant for further understanding whether certain viruses might promote or inhibit (pandemic) influenza spread and whether influenza vaccination could potentially affect trends in other respiratory viruses.",

Such early occurrence may affect the circulation of other seasonal pathogens, and theories on possible interference between outbreaks of different respiratory viruses have been postulated to be a possible cause of delays in expected seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses. 1-3 While those earlier population-level studies focused mainly on the possible interaction between influenza A virus and rhinovirus circulation, there may also be a relationship between influenza A and other prevalent viruses. Therefore, we investigated trends in several common viruses for which laboratory data were available from national surveillance in the Netherlands for a longer time period of up to 10 years including both respiratory and enteral viruses.",

Submitting laboratories are associated with either hospitals or regional laboratories to which both GPs and hospitals submit samples. The estimated proportion of all positive diagnostics captured by this national surveillance varies between the monitored pathogens and was estimated between 38% (for rotavirus) and 73% (for influenza virus) in a 2002 study of five pathogens. 10 The types of tests used can differ between the submitting laboratories and over time. Respiratory viruses were detected in throat swabs mainly by PCR-based methods in respiratory specimens from patients with respiratory disease symptoms. Enteric viruses were detected in fecal samples by EIA-based methods (rotavirus, norovirus) and by PCR-based methods (norovirus). Enterovirus was detected mainly by PCR and in the early years also by culturing, in throat swabs, CNF, and in fecal specimens collected from patients suspected for an enterovirus infection. Cross-reaction between rhinovirus and enterovirus PCRs for throat swab samples cannot be excluded completely. When collected from patients suspected for enterovirus infection, typing of enteroviruses indicated that this was a minority. When collected from patients with respiratory symptoms, enteroviruses might be misidentified as rhinovirus, as occurred during enterovirus D68 outbreaks. 11",

As general practitioner (GP) influenza sentinel surveillance is the current gold standard for influenza surveillance in the Netherlands (with an epidemic threshold), early influenza A seasons were first identified using published dates of the influenza epidemics. We combined this information with visual inspection (as there is no threshold available) of trends in influenza A laboratory diagnoses reported in the Weekly Virological Records System for confirmation of the early ILI epidemics and for identification of any additional early influenza A seasons according to those laboratory data. A pre-defined cutoff point for the identification of early influenza seasons is not available. Using the published ILI epidemic periods, we identified two relatively early influenza A seasons wherein influenza epidemics started before the turn of the year (i.e., before week 1): the 2003/2004 season (epidemic starting in week 49 lasting to week 4) and the 2009/2010 season (epidemic starting in week 41 lasting to week 51). 12, 13 These two early epidemics were also confirmed by visible early increases in influenza laboratory data reported in the Weekly Virological Records System ( Figure 1 ). After visual inspection of the laboratory data, the 2010/2011 season was additionally selected as an early season as influenza A diagnoses were clearly on the rise before week 1 ( Figure 1 ). While the influenza epidemic in the 2008/2009 season did not start early (week 1) 8 according to the ILI sentinel surveillance system, in the laboratory surveillance data this season seemed neither clearly early nor clearly late and was therefore excluded (influenza A laboratory diagnoses in this season are represented in Appendix 1).",

For comparability between the seasons, we presented the number of detected viruses per week as a percentage of the total number of detections during the study period per each respective virus. Due to the intensified testing that occurred during the A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, the total number of influenza A virus laboratory diagnoses in the pandemic season was 13\u00c11 times higher than the average number of influenza A virus laboratory diagnoses in the 2003-2012 seasons, excluding the pandemic season. To facilitate the inclusion of such a high peak into the presented graphs, the number of influenza A virus laboratory diagnoses during the 2009/ 2010 season was scaled down (reduced by a factor 13\u00c11, changing the height but not the shape of the epidemic in that year). As the number of influenza B virus laboratory diagnoses was very low during the pandemic, such downscaling was not performed for the influenza B virus laboratory diagnoses. Smoothing of time series was performed by calculating 3-week moving averages (average of current, previous, and next week's value). Correlation coefficients between different viruses were calculated using Spearman's rank correlations for non-normally distributed data. We also shifted the time series forwards and backwards in time (\u00c010 to +10 weeks) and compared whether the time shift with maximal correlation differed between early and late influenza seasons.",

Time series of all considered pathogens are shown in Figure 1 . Almost all of the included respiratory viruses (influenza A and B virus, RSV, coronavirus) except rhinovirus showed very clear seasonality in their reporting over time. The numbers increase, peak, and are elevated during winter season (December-February) or occasionally in very early spring (March-April) ( Figure 1 and Appendix 2A-D). However, while influenza B virus diagnoses also displayed such winter seasonality, outbreaks did not occur each winter (five of the ten observed years showed clear influenza B epidemics, while the other 5 years showed very low levels or even near-absence). In our data, rhinovirus levels showed less clear seasonality than the other respiratory viruses. They tended to be elevated over broad periods ( Figure 1 ) and seemed to be present year-round with less pronounced elevations during autumn/winter/spring. Generally, RSV van Asten et al. epidemics preceded influenza A virus epidemics, which in turn preceded influenza B epidemics (in the years that influenza B epidemics occurred). Increases in coronavirus also usually preceded increases in influenza A (but not in the 2009/2010 season). The timing of rhinovirus levels relative to influenza A virus in laboratory diagnoses was less clear (due to seemingly year-round presence of rhinoviruses in specimens submitted for laboratory diagnoses). The two gastrointestinal viruses in the study (norovirus and rotavirus) both also presented with winter seasonality, often with norovirus preceding rotavirus epidemics ( Figure 1 and Appendix 2C). Norovirus and influenza A virus epidemics usually overlapped, but the norovirus epidemics had broader peaks, and numbers tended to start increasing earlier than influenza A virus diagnoses levels and decreased after the disappearance of influenza A virus. Also, rotavirus outbreaks usually occurred before influenza A outbreaks started.",

When comparing seasons with early versus later occurrence of influenza epidemics, the maximum correlation coefficient was observed at different lags for all viruses. This difference in time lag relative to influenza A occurrence was smallest for influenza B, indicating that influenza B circulation relative to influenza A tends to occur at a more stable delay than for the other viruses.

In another study in Beijing, all respiratory virus epidemics, except rhinovirus, were delayed after the pandemic influenza epidemic (data came from fever clinics which screen patients prior to being assigned to a specific hospital department). 16 However, both regions have different climates from the Netherlands (and from each other) complicating comparisons.

Only one prospective cohort study has been published (based on one season) which showed rhinovirus and coronavirus to interrupt the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. 18 Our results could not confirm their finding of coronavirus inhibiting influenza A virus circulation, but we observed more coronavirus laboratory reports when influenza A virus circulated early. In contrast to most of the other studies, we could investigate whether patterns recurred due to our longer study period. This revealed that coronavirus laboratory reporting was more intense in 2009/2010 when it did not overlap with influenza A virus circulation. However, it was also more intense in the early influenza A year thereafter (2010/2011) when it actually completely overlapped with the influenza A epidemic hinting that direct biological inhibition of either virus by the other might be unlikely and thus apparent interaction reported by others may have depended on indirect factors or may be spurious. These variations by year in our data illustrate how results from shorter observational studies have to be interpreted with caution, especially when they focus only on 1 year or one season. However, also in our longer study we have to remain cautious; to refute biological inhibition between coronavirus and influenza, it would be helpful to know whether the coronavirus and influenza virus specimens were from the same age group.",

[1] [2] [3] 17 With our data, the precise direction of potential interactions is not clear, that is, which virus(es) impacts which. There are several types of virus-virus interactions, described in a review by Da Palma, 19 ranging from (i) direct virus-virus interactions (e.g., when nucleic acids or proteins of one virus physically interact with the genes or gene products of a coinfecting virus); (ii) indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host environment; to (iii) immunological interactions. However, with the current data we cannot determine whether the viruses impacted each other biologically. Further, there are other issues that can impact the timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics such as environmental, social, and behavioral phenomena that may also be the potential drivers of observed shifts in reporting patterns instead of viral inter-action (alone). 20 To further attempt to disentangle these issues, future ecological studies should preferably include age-specific virological data over multiple seasons and better yet, cohort studies could be performed that (i) address the order of infection by different viruses (by serial sampling of subjects during the study period regardless of symptoms) as proposed by others; 17, 21 (ii) include persons from the same household as was done by Pascalis et al.; 18 and (iii) include multiple years and thus multiple seasons per virus.",

As norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus affect other organ systems, direct interaction may not be expected. However, sporadic examples do not rule out such unexpected interactions as others have suggested that live polio vaccine (against an enteral virus) might prevent otitis media 29 (a respiratory infection), and decrease infantile diarrhea mortality 30 (gastro-intestinal mortality). Another issue is that, like others, we investigated shifts in virus circulation within the same seasons. Whether early occurrence of influenza A may affect the circulation of seasonal pathogens in seasons thereafter is not known.",

Further research is needed to understand whether this was caused by (in)direct biological interaction between viruses or other underlying mechanisms such as human behavior and environmental factors or whether these observed shifts were just random occurrences. Understanding these phenomena is of value in understand-ing or predicting the timing and magnitude of viral epidemics, providing knowledge which can be used for early warning and the allocation of healthcare resources.

Less clear differences in timing of peaks were observed for rhinovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus (Table 2 andFigure 2).Influenza B virus: tendency of absence or earlier occurrence at higher levels During early influenza A seasons, circulation of influenza B virus (i) was virtually absent in two of the three early influenza A seasons (2003/2004 and 2009/2010) or (ii) had a 6-7 weeks earlier occurrence and with much more intensive circulation than usual in 2010/2011. During the five late influenza A seasons, influenza B circulation failed to occur only once (2006/2007) (Figure 2). RSV: tendency of delayed occurrence or decreased peak level During two of the three early influenza A seasons, RSV activity occurred later than usual (Figure 2: 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons, shifted 2-4 weeks [Table 2]). In 2003/ 2004, RSV timing was not unusual but peak level was lower than usual (almost half as low but slightly more spread out). During the five late influenza A seasons, RSV epidemics had such lower peak level only once (2006/2007)(Figure 2).Coronavirus: tendency of higher levels Data were available for two of the three early influenza seasons, and these two seasons coincide with increased coronavirus activity (of which the 2010/2011 season is shifted forward in time)(Figure 2).Viruses showing no clear shifts: rhinovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, enterovirusWe observed no shifts in the seasonal trends of rotavirus and enterovirus (Figure 2). Rhinovirus trends did not change except for a slightly higher number of diagnoses in the 2009/ 2010 season which might be due to the intensified testing of patients with respiratory symptoms during the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic season. Norovirus trends showed nothing exceptional except for a higher-than-usual peak number of diagnoses in the 2009/2010 season, which was a heavy norovirus season due to a new variant strain (Figure 2).",
