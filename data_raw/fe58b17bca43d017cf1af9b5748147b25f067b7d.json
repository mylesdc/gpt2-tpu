As clinical signs often go undetected and various preventive strategies failed, identification of genes affecting BRD is essential for selection for resistance. Selective DNA pooling (SDP) was applied in a genome wide association study (GWAS) to map BRD QTLs in Israeli Holstein male calves. Kosher scoring of lung adhesions was used to allocate 122 and 62 animals to High (Glatt Kosher) and Low (Non-Kosher) resistant groups, respectively. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip according to the Infinium protocol. Moving average of -logP was used to map QTLs and Log drop was used to define their boundaries (QTLRs). The combined procedure was efficient for high resolution mapping. Nineteen QTLRs distributed over 13 autosomes were found, some overlapping previous studies. The QTLRs contain polymorphic functional and expression candidate genes to affect kosher status, with putative immunological and wound healing activities. Kosher phenotyping was shown to be a reliable means to map QTLs affecting BRD morbidity.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex is the leading world-wide cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. It includes upper and lower respiratory tract infections, diphtheria and pneumonia [1, 2] . Due to immature functionality of the respiratory system in young cattle [3] , BRD occurs more frequently and severely at young age, regardless of immunological and management considerations [4, 5] . BRD is the most costly feedlot disease due to prevention and treatment costs, morbidity, mortality, and production amortization that includes performance, carcass merit, meat tenderness and palatability [1, 2, 6, 7] . BRD etiology is multifactorial, affected by a large number of stressors (e.g., weaning, transportation, commingling and others), and viral (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis; IBR, bovine virus diarrhea; BVD, bovine respiratory syncytial virus; BRSV) and bacterial pathogens (primarily, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus and Mycoplasma hyponeumoniae). Many of these pathogens are normally present in the upper respiratory tract, but convert to pathogenic status as a consequence of stressful life history events [8] . Yet, individuals of the same age and environment, when exposed to BRD pathogens, vary greatly in whether they develop the disease [9] , and the severity of clinical symptoms [10] . This variation suggests that genetic control is involved in susceptibility to BRD. Indeed, significant heritability for BRD resistance [11, 12] and differences among breeds [11, 13] have been documented.",

Unfortunately, these strategies have collectively failed to reduce the prevalence of BRD (see citations in [14] ). To date, methods for detecting morbid cattle involve subjective visual appraisal and depend on the stage and extent of the disease. However, clinical signs of BRD may often go undetected in feedlot calves [15] , emphasizing the need of an objective and reliable early risk predictor [5] .

With genome wide mapping and selection procedures based on high density SNP arrays [22] , improving disease resistance through selection for resistance at the genome level has become realistic. Furthermore, high-resolution mapping of the QTLs responsible for genetic variation in resistance can serve as a platform to identify the causative genes themselves [23] , opening further possibilities for disease control through greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance. For example, recent genome-wide association studies of Crohn's Disease identified 71 loci associated with the disease [24] and new pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.",

An alternative well-accepted tool for retrospective diagnosis of BRD is lung lesions monitored at slaughter [28] . Among other categories, lung lesions include abscesses, parenchymal fibrosis, adhesions and emphysema [29] . Wittum et al. [15] found that damage resulting from BRD may leave persistent lesions in bovine lungs. Interestingly, lung lesions resulting from BRD are often found in animals never recorded for clinical BRD [2, 6, 15, 30] . According to Gardner et al. [6] , the high incidence of such cases reflected subclinical events, viral rather than bacterial infection, or disease occurrence at earlier stage, before calves were taken into feedlot. Still, pulmonary lesions at slaughter were indicative of BRD occurrence, which had a significant deleterious effect on production, independent of previous diagnosis of clinical illness [15] . In spite of the fact that it is the only practical way to detect subclinical BRD, only a few studies used lung lesions as an indicator of earlier life BRD episodes [4] .",

Adhesions are formed as a normal part of the body's healing process and help to limit the spread of infection. They are fibrous bands of scar tissue that span the pleural space, between the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura and often between the lobes of the lungs, or between the lungs and the rib cage, and are caused by repeated episodes of inflammation of the lungs. The fibrin bands may eventually dissolve through fibrinolysis, and the traumatized site continues to heal, but there are cases in which fibrinolysis is inhibited [31] . Thus, uncontrolled fibrosis may render the repair process pathogenic, resulting in excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen, and replacement of normal tissue by permanent scar tissue, which influences organ function [32] . In a recent report [33] , calves free of pulmonary adhesions at slaughter were found biologically and economically more efficient than their affected peers. Interestingly, pleural adhesions found in ca. 40% of the calves accounted for reduced growth rate at early life stages [2] .",

To circumvent this, we used a moving average of marker -LogP values with a window size of 23 markers (about 100 kb), and a Log drop of 1 to define QTLRs and their boundaries (details in Methods).

Among the 1,111 markers, 545 mapped within 35 genes (Table 3) . KCNE4 in QTLR 5 on BTA 2 is also presented in Table 3 , even though no SNP was mapped to it. Thus, Table 3 presents a total of 36 genes. Among these, annotation data were available in David Database for only 20 genes. Considering all genes included within or in the 0.5 Mb flanks of the QTLRs, a total of 130 genes were found, of which annotation data were available for 98. Their biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), molecular function (MF) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) are detailed in S1 Table ( 'gene not clustered' and 'Kegg pathway' sheets, respectively). Among these 98 genes, we focused on 18 candidates, based on biological and statistical considerations as detailed in the Discussion. We searched NCBI dbSNP for non-synonymous (AA substitution) polymorphisms, candidates to be the causative mutation of the found BRD effect. The NCBI dbSNP present a substantial polymorphism in all 18 genes (Table 4 ). These genes averaged 664.5 AA, 1,993.5 bp. All genes had SNPs in the coding regions (average 7.8% of all SNPs); all had AA substitutions (average 78.4% of the coding SNPs) and all had AA substitutions involving change of properties (average 60.4% of all AA substitutions). Although these are published polymorphisms, not polymorphisms found in the study population, they present the potential functional polymorphisms of the QTLR genes.",

On average 2.9 genes in a QTLR responded to a challenge by one or more Using Kosher Phenotyping to Map BRD QTLs pathogens. Fifteen of the QTLRs included genes that changed expression in response to at least one pathogen. QTLRs 3, 4, 8 and 18, contained genes that among them responded to all pathogens. All pathogens changed expression of genes in at least 4 QTLRs, averaging 9.3 QTLRs. The 43 genes found by Tizioto et al.

Genetically, the Israel Holstein cattle population is very homogeneous. There is a single artificial insemination center that serves the entire country, so all female replacements are produced from the same pool of sires. Thus, the dams are a homogenous group and there is no reason to suspect population subdivision or stratification. The calves in the study population were produced over the course of a year, and hence represent a set of sire half-sib progeny groups. Examination of the pedigree of the study animals did not uncover any differential allocation of herds, sires, or maternal grandsires among the Glatt kosher and non-kosher groups. Hence, we believe that population structure was not a factor in our findings. The inspector of the internal organs of the animal for assigning kosher status is trained to look for lung adhesions in the animal both before and after its lungs are removed. To test a lung, the inspector first removes all adhesions. If the lung is still intact it is classified as \"Kosher\"; Torn adhesions that cause perforations in the lung render it \"Non-Kosher\" (NK); Finally, lungs that are adhesion-free are referred to as \"Glatt Kosher\" (GK), referring to the fact that the animal's lungs do not have any adhesions. In the current study GK individuals were taken as the High resistant group, while NK individuals were taken as the Low resistant group, as also recently appeared in Hayes et al. [65] .",

Thus, each marker requires an appropriate SE 2 (D), depending on its frequency. Consequently, we binned the markers in bins of width 0.1 from 0.0 to 1.0, according to their average pB across all pools (Avg pB i ), and calculated average Var(pB) across the markers in each bin. Table 8 shows that indeed Var(pB) maximized in the range 0.4 to 0.6, dropping off to either side, thus justifying the use of Var(pB) according the marker mean pB.

While searching for regions containing QTLs (QTLRs), significance of a single marker may not be enough to declare a QTLR, as a singleton significant P, without any support from surrounding markers, is prone to be false positive. On the other hand, visual inspection of chromosomal scatter charts reveals clusters of significant marker -LogP values (e.g., Fig 1) . We interpret these clusters as putative QTLR. Note, however, that high -LogP values are interspersed with very low values across the cluster region. This behavior is related to complex LD patterns observed across small chromosomal regions [68] . Nevertheless, average -LogP value across a cluster region will be greater than in the adjoining regions lacking a concentration of high -LogP markers. Thus, to identify the clusters quantitatively, assign them an overall -LogP value, and determine their boundaries, we used a moving average of -LogP in 1 nucleotide steps taken across a window of markers. QTLRs were declared on the basis of windows having average -LogP above some chosen threshold. For the present study, average spacing between markers was 4,394 bp. Hence, windows of size 23 markers, equivalent to an average window size of 100 Kb were used. The size of a window was chosen to give a reasonable physical length yet not be overly influenced by the -LogP value of any single marker. A moving average of -LogP = 2, corresponding to P = 0.01, was set as the threshold value for declaration of a window as a QTLR. This threshold was set to give a reasonable number of ranked QTLR for further study in depth.",

The popular LOD drop method [69] works well when applied to family-based linkage mapping and the low-density microsatellite maps of the previous generation of QTL mapping. In such studies, there is usually a monotonic inverse relation between marker significance and marker location relative to the most significant marker; with marker significance ascending monotonically marker by marker to the most significant marker and descending monotonically from that point. With GWAS and high-density marker maps, however, we are faced with the above-mentioned phenomenon where highly significant and non-significant markers are interspersed across the cluster. Consequently, there is no longer a monotonic relation between marker location and marker significance, making it impossible to apply the LOD drop method. That is, considering -LogP values of individual markers of the cluster, going out from the putative point location of the QTL (the most significant marker of the cluster), one will meet one or more non-significant markers, ostensibly setting a LOD drop boundary, but then just beyond these, are a new series of significant markers, clearly part of the same cluster and QTLR (e. g., Fig 2) .",

This allowed the use of the LOD drop method for setting QTLR boundaries. For the present study, since we did not have LOD scores but -LogP, we used instead a -LogP drop of 1 (denoted \"Log drop\"). As noted above, for the cluster on BTA 29, the top window had average -LogP = 2.470. Accordingly, the Log drop 1 boundary of the QTLR were at -LogP = 1.470. The upstream and downstream windows with means closest to this value (-LogP = 1.470 and 1.492, respectively; Fig 2) were taken as the boundary windows. Since the windows are located by the average location of their markers, the actual boundaries of the QTLR were from the first marker of the upstream boundary window, to the final marker of the downstream boundary window. These markers were taken to define the final boundaries of the QTLR.",

If the entire region between the peaks was above the higher Log drop 1 threshold, they were taken as one QTLR; otherwise, they were taken as two separate QTLRs.

With one exception, none of the analyzed SNPs was in a coding region. SNP location and gene annotation were according to the UMD3.1.1 assembly. The full Ensembl v79 gene set for the autosomal chromosomes was downloaded (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/76d1cab099658c68bde77f7daf55117e). To identify the genes located within the QTLRs and inside 0.5 Mb intervals flanking the position of each SNP marker that define the same regions, we created a consensus list (among QTLRs and downloaded genes) using the BedTools software [71] .",
