Stool extracts, from which PV, HEV-C, or HEV-A was isolated in the cell culture system, were mostly positive by RT-LAMP method (positive rates of 15/16 (= 94%), 13/ 14 (= 93%), and 4/4 (= 100%), respectively). The positive rate of this RT-LAMP system for stool extracts from which HEV-B was isolated was lower than that of HEV-C (positive rate of 11/21 (= 52%)). In the stool samples, which were negative for enterovirus isolation by the cell culture system, we found that two samples were positive for RT-LAMP (positive rates of 2/38 (= 5.3%)).

The isolation procedure of PV have been established based on the cell culture system using a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD cells) and a mouse L cell line expressing PV receptor (L20B cells) [1, 2] . The advantages of cell culture-based procedure are; 1) apparatuses for molecular diagnosis are not required, and 2) a high sensitivity (detection limit of 1 infectious dose that contains 50 to 1,000 virions in picornavirus infection) [3] . The disadvantage is that some expertise and quality control system are required for the cell culture system and for the identification of the cytopathic effect of infected cells. As for the timeliness of reporting, the cell culture-based procedure is time-consuming. It takes for 10 days to confirm the sample as PV-negative even after the introduction of the latest procedure \"New Algorism\" recommended by WHO [2] . Currently, detection of the circulating vaccine-derived PV (cVDPV) has a high priority in the eradication program and will be in the post-eradication era. Therefore, rapid (at the order of day) and sensitive detection of PV in laboratory diagnosis could contribute to shortening of the timeliness of reporting for mop-up vaccine campaign to control cVDPV outbreaks.",

PV-like 5'NTR is observed for enteroviruses belonging to Human enterovirus species C (HEV-C) and HEV-D, and CBV-like 5'NTR is observed for those belonging to HEV-A and HEV-B, respectively [11] . Therefore, we designed the primer sets to detect PV-like 5'NTR according to conditions required for the primer in RT-LAMP reaction in terms of the location and Tm values of the primers http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/lamp/primer.html ( Figure  1b) . Among the 5 primers used in the RT-LAMP reaction, 2 primers were preferable (a complete match for PV-like 5'NTR near the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, FIP primer) or specific (a complete match for PV-like 5'NTR at the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, BIP primer) to PVlike 5'NTR ( Figure 2 ).

            "text": "An essential factor of the sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for the detection of PV from stool extracts seems to be the amount of viral RNA available for the reaction in addition to the quality of the RNA. We found one stool sample (CAM2553) was negative by the RT-LAMP among the 16 stool extract that was positive for PV by cell culture (Figure  3d ). The 5' NTR of the PV2(CAM2553) did not have any nucleotide changes from that of its parental PV2(Sabin) strain ( Figure 4) . It is plausible that the low amount of viral RNA in the sample caused this false-negative result under the detection limit of RT-LAMP. The amounts of PV in the stool extracts were not generally high (< 10 0.5 to 10 2.5 CCID 50 /50 \u03bcl, Table 1 ). In the RT-LAMP reaction examined in this study, we purified viral RNA from 200 \u03bcl of stool extract and collected in 50 \u03bcl of elusion buffer (4fold concentration by this procedure), and then 2.5 \u03bcl of this purified viral RNA solution was used for RT-LAMP reaction. Therefore, the net amount of viral RNA used in RT-LAMP reaction corresponds to that contained in 10 \u03bcl of stool extract. For the isolation of PV, 200 \u03bcl of stool extract is inoculated into the cells. Therefore, there is 20fold difference in the available viral RNA or the infectious units between the RT-LAMP system and the cell culture system because of the intrinsic difference of the scale of the assay (12.5 \u03bcl vs. 1.0 ml). Because of a high particleto-infective-unit ratio of PV, which was estimated as 56 to 153 copies of viral genome per CCID 50 in this study (Figure 3c) , relatively high sensitivity was attained in RT-LAMP system almost comparable to that of cell culturebased isolation. It should be noted that the sensitivity of this RT-LAMP system (< 400 copies) was not high compared to those of optimized RT-LAMP systems (1-100 copies), and was lower than that of a conventional realtime PCR system [17] (< 10 copies). Additional procedures to increase the concentration of viral RNA and to improve the quality of RNA would be helpful to improve the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP system for the detection of PV from stool extracts.",

Stocks of the primers were prepared in distilled water in concentrations as follows; 40 \u03bcM for FIP and BIP primers, 5 \u03bcM for F and B primers, and 20 \u03bcM for Loop B primers. RT-LAMP reaction was performed by using a RNA Amplification Kit (RT-LAMP) (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). RT-LAMP reaction was prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction but in a total 12.5 \u03bcl reaction. The final concentrations of the primers were as follows; 1.6 \u03bcM for FIP and BIP primers, 0.2 \u03bcM for F and B primers, and 0.8 \u03bcM for Loop B primers. In the total 12.5 \u03bcl reaction, 2.5 \u03bcl of purified viral RNA solution or diluted cell culture supernatant were included (Figure 1c ). RT-LAMP reaction was performed at 60\u00b0C for 90 min and optical density at 650 nm was measured as the turbidity by a Loopamp Realtime Turbidimeter LA-320C (Teramecs, Kyoto, Japan). The threshold of the turbidity for RT-LAMP positive sample was defined at 0.1 in the measurement [5] . The numbers of copies of the viral RNA of PV Sabin strains and prototype enterovirus strains were determined by real-time TaqMan PCR system developed by Nijhuis et al. [17] , as described previously [21]. ",
