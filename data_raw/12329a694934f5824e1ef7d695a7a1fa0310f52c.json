Though for the past decade there have been numerous advancements and improvements in epitope prediction, on average the best benchmark prediction accuracies are still only around 60%. New machine learning algorithms have arisen within the domain of deep learning, text mining, and convolutional networks. This paper presents a novel analytically trained and string kernel using deep neural network, which is tailored for continuous epitope prediction, called: Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor (DRREP). Results: DRREP was tested on long protein sequences from the following datasets: SARS, Pellequer, HIV, AntiJen, and SEQ194. DRREP was compared to numerous state of the art epitope predictors, including the most recently published predictors called LBtope and DMNLBE. Using area under ROC curve (AUC), DRREP achieved a performance improvement over the best performing predictors on SARS (13.7%), HIV (8.9%), Pellequer (1.5%), and SEQ194 (3.1%), with its performance being matched only on the AntiJen dataset, by the LBtope predictor, where both DRREP and LBtope achieved an AUC of 0.702. Conclusion: DRREP is an analytically trained deep neural network, thus capable of learning in a single step through regression. By combining the features of deep learning, string kernels, and convolutional networks, the system is able to perform residue-by-residue prediction of continues epitopes with higher accuracy than the current state of the art predictors.",

In contrast, the promise of successful subunit vaccines (epitope-driven vaccine) comes from antigens [2] . Our ability to design subunit vaccines depends on our ability to find good vaccine targets on the foreign object in question, it depends on our ability to find epitopes. There are numerous experimental techniques for B-cell epitope mapping [3] , but of 3D interaction of protein residues in close spatial proximity, but discontinuous on the actual protein sequence. Predicting both of these epitope types is a computationally difficult, and because conformational epitopes can be considered as clusters or spatially joined continuous epitopes, the prediction of continuous eptopes is an essential step for both problems. Finally, because there is a substantially larger amount of epitope sequence based data than there is structural, protein sequence based (as opposed to structure based) prediction is a much more feasible problem at this time.",

Our linear B-Cell epitope predictor is based on a deep neural network (DNN) [5] , which utilizes a string mismatch function based first hidden layer, a second normalization pooling layer, an analytically computed third hidden layer, followed by another non-linear pooling layer, and a final fifth layer composed of a single threshold neuron. Our intuition is that because there is structure within protein sequences, and because we are dealing with sequences composed of characters, these structures and patterns are based on the k-mers within the sequences. Thus, a way to find and extract them, is through the use of string based activation functions, similar to methods applied in text mining. Because we do not know ahead of time the actual structures, lengths, and patterns of these k-mers, one way to solve the problem of exposing them is to generate a large number of our own random k-mer patterns, tiling the sequence with them, and counting how many, and which of our generated k-mers match the k-mers within the sequence being analysed. This k-mer tiling method extrapolates the protein sequence into a large feature space, which we can then cluster, separate, and classify through regression. In DRREP, we perform this regression step using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse [6] .",

The input to BepiPred was based on numerous physicochemical properties and protein secondary structure.

Furthermore, the training datasets have been small, with a size of roughly 1500 total samples. To solve this problem, Singh et al. composed a new dataset of epitopes and non-epitopes, an order of magnitude larger and using the available data from IEDB [32, 33] .

Training is done in multiple phases. First, N number of 3 layer neural networks, called Sub_DRREPs, are generated and trained independently (each such Sub_DRREP network is composed of the DRREP's first 3 layers). The N networks are then stacked in parallel, with each network's output aggregated, and then normalized by the norm-pooling 4th layer.

Though DRREP can be composed of Sub_DRREPs of different sized sliding windows, in this paper we have explored composing DRREP where all Sub_DRREP networks use the same sized sliding windows. We have explored different values for Y, and different values for the parameter N (total number of Sub-DRREPs), and settled on Y = 24 and N = 20, which resulted in the best validation score, and a DRREP that was fast to train. DRREP makes its predictions purely based on the amino acid sequence. The first hidden layer in each Sub_DRREP is composed of a random number S of basic mismatch activation functions, each of which uses a randomly generated k-mer whose size ranges between 1 and the size of the sliding window Y. Based on our experiments, a string mismatch activation function which allows for 0 mismatches, produces the best results. Thus, each neuron using the basic mismatch activation function in the first layer counts the number of times its k-mer occurred in the sequence of the sliding window. Each Sub_DRREP's first layer, L1, is composed of S neurons, each of which is made out of a randomly generated k-mer based mismatch function. The second layer, L2, is composed of S nodes, with the entire layer performing normalization of the L1's signals. Layer L3, is the learning linear neural layer, whose synaptic weights are calculated using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. All N Sub_DRREPs are stacked in parallel. The L4 is a norm-pooling layer, composed of N nodes, which normalizes the signals from each Sub_DRREP. The next layer, L5, is composed of a single thresholding neuron, which weighs each contribution from the Sub_DRREPs based on that Sub_DRREP's relative validation score, and passes this value through the threshold to output the final score for the input sliding window This allows the second normalization layer to calculate the proportions of various types of k-mers occurring within the window. Our intuition is that there are numerous small k-mers which are particularly antigenic, but we do not know which ones, or in which order and ratios they should be to trigger an immune response. Our system generates a large number of random k-mers, and through regression the system finds the correlation between the ratio and combination of the presence of these k-mers, and antigenicity.",

DRREP's sliding window moves through the long input sequence, and for each sliding window, DRREP's basic mismatch functions in the first hidden layer output the number of times their k-mer appeared in the window. The second pooling hidden layer in DRREP normalizes these scalar values, producing a k-mer ratio vector, and then passes this vector onwards to the 3rd layer. The third layer is the learning layer, whose synaptic weights are computed in a single step after all the training input vectors (windows) have been processed by the first 2 layers to produce the matrix H. The synaptic weights are computed using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, using the provided labels for the training dataset. This is done for each Sub_DRREP independently. Their (Sub_DRREPs) outputs are then passed onwards to layer 4, where they are pooled and normalized (this time, between the Sub_DRREPs, rather than the neurons within each single Sub_DRREP as was done in the 2nd hidden layer). Finally, the 5th layer is composed of a single threshold neuron with N weights, one for each Sub_DRREP. After the training and validation phases for the entire DRREP are completed, the synaptic weights for this neuron are set to the validation AUC scores of each Sub_DRREP, so that the voting contribution of each Sub_DRREP is based on its performance on the validation dataset. The neuron calculates its output in the standard linear neuron fashion, through the application of the dot product, resulting in the final output score. This output score can then further be passed through a threshold, so that the output is a classification rather than a score. By default, the threshold of the neuron is set to the mean score of the entire score sequence that DRREP produces (made possible by DRREP first calculating all the scores, and then calculating the threshold based on the mean).",

Where possible, we ran the server-available predictors on the SARS and HIV datasets, these included the CBTOPE, Epitopia, ABCPred, LBtope, and DMN-LBE predictors. CBTOPE and Epitopia servers produced score based outputs, whereas ABCPred produced a list of index start locations of the predicted 16-sized window based epitopes. This required a conversion to a single residue score based format, and was performed by using the highest epitope score for each residue's location. We have also used the CBTOPE and ABCPred servers to calculate scores for the HIV dataset. We had difficulty running Epitopia on the longer HIV dataset, as the server produced runerrors. Also, unfortunately, DMN-LBE server predicts one sequence at a time. Thus, due to the large number of sequences AntiJen and SEQ194 datasets are composed of, we were only able to run the smaller SARS, HIV, and Pellequer datasets on the server (doing so manually, one sequence at a time). For the missing predictors, or where the AUC scores are not listed in the table, we did not get a response from the authors as to the proper conversion from the output format produced by their predictor, to the score based format we needed to calculate AUC and accuracies, or the server for that predictor was not available. Nevertheless, we applied DRREP to every dataset (without retraining), so that it could be compared to every system which was originally tested on it.

But, DRREP classified the four sub-sequences as all belonging to a single epitope. This could potentially be alleviated by adding a post-processing filter which calculates not just a score, but changes in a score as well. We base this hypothesis on the fact that we observed a number of cases where the score transitioned significantly between continuous sequences of epitope and non-epitope sequences, yet still held above the epitope threshold for both cases. Based on this observation, perhaps the system could be further improved by taking into account radical score transitions. This methodology is planned to be explored in our future research. From all the test datasets on which LBtope was tested, it performed the worst on SARS. For the tests performed, the version of LBtope used was based on the one trained on a fixed 20 residue window based dataset, which was used in the original LBtope publication. When using this version, the server does not predict the last residue, hence it was designated with an asterisk. An LBtope trained on flexible window based original dataset was also tested on SARS, because that version does predict the last residue, but it performed much worse than the version shown, and thus was not included. The Epitopia server also did not provide the classification for the 193rd residue in the SARS sequence. Another interesting anomaly in residue prediction results was produced by ABCPred. ABCPred server gives a score for 16 residue slices, with a default epitope score threshold set to 0.5. Based on this, ABCPred classified numerous such 16 residue slices as epitopes, and when combined together, this included all but the first two residues in the SARS sequence.",

This dataset was also ran on the LBtope server, which achieved an AUC of 0.71. DRREP achieved an AUC performance improvement of 5.6% over the best performing predictor (LBtope). It should be noted that the dataset SEQ194 is the most recently published of all datasets, with the largest number of long, FASTA encoded sequences. Furthermore, LBtope was ran using the LBtope_Fixed_non_redundant (non redundant dataset) version, which was the one reported in their most recent paper, and we considered to be the best performer of the versions available.",

DRREP tied with the LBtope on the remaining fifth dataset, the AntiJen dataset. And though DMN-LBE achieved a higher accuracy at 75% specificity on the HIV dataset, and parity on Pellequer, it will not be possible to know the 75% specificity threshold when the systems are applied to new and unknown sequences, thus AUC is still the best indicator of system's general performance. These results demonstrate DRREP's markedly higher general performance.",

The learning layer synaptic weights are calculated analytically using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, making the training phase faster than that of SVM, and standard gradient descent based models. When DRREP was applied to the SARS sequence, the achieved classification accuracy at 75% specificity was 86.0%, which is 5.7% higher than the BCPred/FBCPred, it's AUC was higher by over 13.7% than that of LBtope on the same sequence. When applied to the HIV, Pellequer, and SEQ194 datasets, DRREP achieved an AUC performance improvement of 8.4%, 3.2%, and 5.6% respectively, over the best performing predictors in the list, which were the most recently published DMN-LBE and LBtope predictors. The only dataset on which DRREP did not achieve a performance improvement was the AntiJen dataset, on which both DRREP and LBtope achieved the same AUC score. We believe that these results represent a substantial and highly regular and stable improvement over the current state of the art.",

We also plan to further explore the effect of training dataset refinement on the system's performance.
