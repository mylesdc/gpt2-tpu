Despite extensive studies performed to elucidate the function of several viral proteins, the contribution of an accessory protein ORF3 in PEDV replication is still largely unknown. Here, we constructed expression plasmids as well as recombinant PEDV carrying myc-tagged ORF3 to assess their expression and subcellular localization in both transfected and infected cells. In PEDV-infected cells, ORF3 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, partially in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (Golgi). Interestingly, ORF3 with the N-terminal Flag tag was also detected on the cell surface concomitant with the spike (S) protein as determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. ORF3 and S proteins were also co-localized at perinuclear compartments and in the vesicle-like structures in transfected and infected cells. We also demonstrated that both full-length and naturally truncated ORF3 proteins could interact with the S protein but with different binding affinity, which correlate with the ability of the protein to regulate virus replication in cell culture. Collectively, our results underscore the unprecedented role of the ORF3, which involves the interaction of ORF3 with S and, possibly, other structural protein during PEDV replication.",

            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes severe enteric diseases with a high mortality rate in suckling piglets [1] . For decades, pathogenic strains of PEDV have caused recurrent outbreaks with enormous economic losses worldwide. The 28-kb PEDV genome has a gene organization typical of an Alphacoronavirus, i.e., ORF 1a/b, spike (S), open reading frame 3 (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid (N) genes [2] . Although not entirely elucidated, it is assumed that PEDV replication is initiated by the interaction of the S protein to cellular receptors, followed by endocytosis-mediated viral internalization [3] . After the release of viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm, replicase proteins undergo extensive intracellular membranes modification to promote viral RNA synthesis. Shortly after synthesis of structural proteins, nascent virions are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), before being released, via smooth-walled vesicles, by exocytosis. While the roles of structural proteins in coronavirus (CoV) replication have been extensively studied, the contribution of the accessory ORF3 protein, particularly in PEDV replication, remains quite elusive. Mounting evidence has suggested that ORF3 is one of the key determinants of PEDV virulence [4] . Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which it modulates viral pathogenicity are as yet clearly defined.",

The full-length ORF3 (675 nt; 224 aa) is found in wild-type PEDVs, while the truncated ORF3 (624 nt; 207 aa; 82-98 amino acid deletion) is common in cell-adapted or attenuated PEDVs [4] . Structurally, ORF3 has been predicted to harbor multiple transmembrane domains, existing as a tetrameric ion channel [5] . However, results from assays using cells stably expressing ORF3 revealed that the protein was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm [6] . Cells expressing ORF3 also displayed a prolonged S phase of the cell cycle and augmented vesicle formation [6] . These results altogether point to the possibility that ORF3 might not be a typical ion channel, but rather a multifunctional protein that is involved in many cellular processes. Notably, since cell culture-adapted variants of PEDV usually possess abortive ORF3, be it absent or truncated [4] , it is also likely that ORF3 might interfere with PEDV replication in cultured cells [7] .",

It is also difficult to assess ORF3 expression in virus-infected cells as specific antibodies are either not accessible or ineffective. In this study, we constructed recombinant PEDV bearing ORF3 with specific epitope tags and evaluated the ORF3 expression in infected cells in comparison to those transfected by the expression plasmid. We demonstrated that the expression of ORF3 in PEDV-infected cells is distinct from that transiently expressed in individual cells. Furthermore, we found that ORF3 and S are co-localized in several cellular compartments in infected cells and the ORF3-S interaction was also confirmed. Collectively, our results suggest that ORF3 may interact with S during PEDV assembly and consequently exert its activity at this step of virus replication.",

However, due to the lack of effective ORF3 antibodies, we could not evaluate the expression and subcellular localization of ORF3 in infected cells. We thus attempted to generate recombinant PEDV AV12 carrying the codon-optimized ORF3-FL and-Trnc carrying myc-tag at the C-terminal as depicted in Figure 1A . The recombinant viruses, PEDV AV12 _ORF3-FL and-Trnc, could be propagated in VeroE6-APN cells with massive syncytium formation ( Figure 1B ). To confirm the presence of the ORF3 gene, we isolated viral RNAs of each recombinant virus and verified the sequence. Notably, both viruses contained the expected ORF3-myc with up to two amino acid mutations detected in some variants of ORF3-Trnc protein ( Figure S1 ). To test whether the additional myc-tag affected the viral growth, we compared the viral growth kinetics between the reverse genetics-derived PEDV AV12 encoding untagged ORF3 and myc-tagged ORF3. We found that both viruses could efficiently infect and induce massive syncytium formation in VeroE6-APN cells with titers obtained from cells infected with each virus exhibiting no statistical difference ( Figure S2 ).",

To evaluate the effect of the amino acid deletion, we constructed the truncated ORF3 (ORF3-Trnc). In addition, we employed reverse genetics to generate recombinant PEDV carrying ORF3-myc without disturbing the virus growth and were able to follow ORF3 subcellular localization in infected cells.

Similarly, accessory proteins from other coronaviruses such as U274 protein from Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [15] and ORF3 from Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63) [16] are also reported to have ion-channel activity. It is thus possible that these proteins may share common functions. Our results in this study, however, suggest that ORF3 may play multiple roles in addition to being ion channels during replication of PEDV in host cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has demonstrated that ORF3 in cells stably expressing the protein was predominantly cytosolic [6] . In addition, cells expressing ORF3 exhibited a prolonged S phase, suggesting that ORF3 may be associated with the host's cell cycle machinery [6] . Furthermore, our findings that the ORF3 protein expressed in transfected and infected cells displayed different patterns led us to speculate that the additional band in infected cells might be due to post-translational modifications that occurred during protein trafficking through the ER-Golgi compartments [15] .

To evaluate the effect of the amino acid deletion, we constructed the truncated ORF3 (ORF3-Trnc). In addition, we employed reverse genetics to generate recombinant PEDV carrying ORF3-myc without disturbing the virus growth and were able to follow ORF3 subcellular localization in infected cells.

Similarly, accessory proteins from other coronaviruses such as U274 protein from Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [15] and ORF3 from Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63) [16] are also reported to have ion-channel activity. It is thus possible that these proteins may share common functions. Our results in this study, however, suggest that ORF3 may play multiple roles in addition to being ion channels during replication of PEDV in host cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has demonstrated that ORF3 in cells stably expressing the protein was predominantly cytosolic [6] . In addition, cells expressing ORF3 exhibited a prolonged S phase, suggesting that ORF3 may be associated with the host's cell cycle machinery [6] . Furthermore, our findings that the ORF3 protein expressed in transfected and infected cells displayed different patterns led us to speculate that the additional band in infected cells might be due to post-translational modifications that occurred during protein trafficking through the ER-Golgi compartments [15] . Indeed, the in silico analysis of ORF3 by the WoLFPSORT program predicts its cellular localization in ER, Golgi apparatus, and vesicle of the secretory pathway, which is confirmed by our immunofluorescence data.

Indeed, we showed that both ORF3-FL and-Trnc proteins were co-localized with the S protein. Interestingly, ORF3-Trnc displayed a more apparent association with the S protein particularly at the perinuclear membrane of transfected cells and the vesicle-like compartments in infected cells. Ultrastructural characterization in PEDV infected cells has revealed that the PEDV virus replication site was mainly at the perinuclear space where maturation of the virus particles was formed and packaged into the vacuoles through the vesicular pathway in the ER and Golgi compartments [21] . The fact that ORF3 were found co-localized with S protein at the perinuclear area and in the vesicular structures may suggest its contribution at this step of the replication cycle. It is also notable that other accessory proteins from other coronaviruses have been shown to interact with viral structural proteins such as S, M, and E proteins [15, 16, 20] . In addition, recent evidence has suggested a possible association between S and ORF3 to increase virus replication and virulence in nursing piglets. Recombinant PEDV viruses lacking ORF3 were of very low virulence despite the expression of S derived from a highly pathogenic variant. Interestingly, when the functional ORF3 was restored, the recombinant viruses bearing S from the pathogenic strain and ORF3 displayed increased virulence [22] . These data, therefore, suggest that S and ORF3 may work in concert to regulate PEDV replication in vivo.",

Cells were prepared under non-permeabilization condition. Co-localization of PEDV FlagORF3 with S proteins was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Rabbit anti-Flag epitope or mouse anti-S1 antibodies and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa flour 488 or-mouse IgG Alexa flour 647 were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Scale bars are 10 \u00b5m.",
