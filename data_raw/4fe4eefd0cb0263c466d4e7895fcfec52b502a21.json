            "text": "Background: Since SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong has experienced several major epidemic risks, but how general community might react to the repeated infectious diseases health risks have not been studied. In 2013, imported human H7N9 influenza infected cases from China were reported. Our study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) concerning A/H7N9 among Hong Kong general population regarding pandemic preparedness in early 2014. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong in February 2014. The study survey was composed of 78 KAP questions. Factors associated with individual and household pandemic preparedness were analyzed. Results: Final study sample was 1,020 with a response rate of 45.9 %. Among the respondents, most of them believed personal hygiene and avoidance of avian contacts were effective in preventing H7N9 infections. The majority of respondents had satisfactory hand hygiene practices and avoided touching avian species but did not employ other preventive measures. Female, 25 years old or older, white collar workers, people with chronic diseases and people living in the city center tended to report better hygiene practices. The average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score was 1.85, similar to that of the period during the first wave and at the start of the second wave of the H7N9 epidemic. Self-reported face masks wearing when having influenza-like illness in general population dropped from 92.4 % during H5N1 period in 2007 to 39.0 % in this study. Conclusion: Hong Kong citizens show a low level of anxiety, misconceptions regarding the novel strains as well as gaps between perceived usefulness and practice of preventive measures towards influenza outbreaks. Educational campaigns and framing the issue to increase public and media awareness are crucial in preventing the current public fatigue towards outbreaks.",

            "text": "The experience of SARS coronavirus epidemic in 2003 has radically changed the concept and catalyzed actions globally and locally for combating infectious diseases outbreaks at the community level [1, 2] . Different health agencies globally are now striving to increase community resilience in combating this emerging infectious disease challenge. In particular, in the Hong Kong Special Administration Region of China, where a number of infectious diseases epidemic originated, resources were invested for enhancing infrastructure, policies and health education for pandemic preparedness and infection control. Whilst population resilience level in Hong Kong in handling infectious disease challenges are thought to be higher than other global cities, the mild clinical outcome of A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and the limited transmissibility of the A/H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in humans in 2007 may have modified citizens' attitude and perceived risk towards similar outbreak incidences [3] [4] [5] , and may have led them to underestimate the emerging A/H7N9 outbreak at the community level. A study conducted between 2006 and 2010 suggested that prolonged warning of a future pandemic was likely to cause pandemic fatigue in the public [6, 7] . For example, studies showed a decrease in self-reported mask use in case of influenza-like illness symptoms since the SARS in 2003 and post-SARS period [8] . There is currently limited literature to examine how prolonged warning may affect community perception and response to these large scale infectious disease risks.",

            "text": "In March 2013, a human infected H7N9 influenza A virus (A/H7N9) case was first identified in Eastern China and caught global attention [9, 10] . Serious response level of the Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic was activated in Hong Kong in Dec 2013 [11] . As of August 2014, a total of 450 confirmed cases were reported in various provinces in China [12] . A recent study in Hong Kong during the first wave of H7N9 epidemic in April 2013 showed low population anxiety levels [13] . Although current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission for A/H7N9 is rare, a small cluster of infected cases within the family showed hospitalization might be required [14] [15] [16] . Confirmed case fatality rate was around 20 %, although the estimated symptomatic case fatality risk was lower [17] . At that time, there were a substantial number of confirmed cases of human infected cases of H7N9 avian influenza during the second wave of the epidemic (Fig. 1) . Meanwhile, the infection rate of seasonal influenza was high in Hong Kong, as reflected by the Government Center for Health protection sentinel surveillance system [4] . Some personal behaviors had been suggested to be effective to control pandemics such as SARS and H5N1 in Hong Kong. Previous studies suggested that close contact with live poultry, visiting public places and the places having confirmed cases were risk factors, while frequent mask use, hand washing, disinfection, and avoidance of eating poultry were protective factors [13, 18, 19] . In this study, we conducted a representative, population-based telephone survey in Hong Kong 1) to investigate the current situation regarding the self-reported knowledge, attitude and practice of pandemic responses at individual level on the second wave human infected A/H7N9 avian influenza outbreak; and 2) to investigate factors associated with the self-reported personal hygiene practices.",

The telephone interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. The telephone calls were made in the evening on weekdays (6 pm-10 pm) and during daytime and evening on weekends (10 am-10 pm) to prevent over representation of the unemployed population. The subjects undergoing the interview were chosen based on the \"last birthday method\" [21, 22] , in which the household member who was present in the household during the survey and whose last birthday was closest to the interview date was invited to participate. The subjects were invited on the basis of the proportion of age, gender and living district from the 2011 Hong Kong Population Census data. The sampling would continue until the quotas for each stratum were met. If the selected participant was busy or not there, up to 4 follow-up calls would be made. The numbers were called for a maximum of 5 times before being classified as unanswered.",

The population anxiety level was similar to a recent study in Hong Kong during the first wave of H7N9 epidemic in April 2013, and did not increase comparing to the beginning of the second wave when the first case imported in Hong Kong in December 2013 [13] . The anxiety score was also similar to that during the first wave of H1N1 in 2009. In contrast, the anxiety score was much higher (STAI 2.50) during SARS [5] . 74.8 % of Hong Kong population would avoid going to crowded places, and 74.7 % and 71.8 % would avoid going to mainland China and hospitals respectively during SARS period in 2003 [27] . In current study, only 7 % would avoid going to public places and using public transport, and 55.8 % avoid going to places having H7N9 confirmed cases. The findings may indicate public fatigue in response to prolonged warning of influenza pandemic, with people reporting less adoption of infection control behaviours.

In the current study, this figure was 87.2 %. This might be due to public health announcements on mass media, emphasizing the importance of washing hands frequently. In contrast, for mask wearing and utensils sharing, the proportion of actual practices was far lower than perceived usefulness. 92.4 % of the Hong Kong residents wore face masks when having influenza-like illness during H5N1 period in 2007 [19] and 88.7 % in 2009 during H1N1 period [8] . In the current study, it dropped to 39.0 %. Barriers for taking action may be partly due to discomfort when wearing mask, traditional Chinese norm of sharing utensils when dining, and the inconvenience. Nevertheless, our study results showed the main reason hindering individual control behaviors were that people did not consider H7N9 outbreak a serious threat.
