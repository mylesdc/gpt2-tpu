CTLs are activated when their TCRs bind a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I/peptide complex on the surface of antigen presenting cells such as macrophages (M\u03a6). It is now apparent that M\u03a6 display remarkable plasticity in response to environmental signals to polarize into classically activated M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or alternatively activated M(IL-4). However, little is known about how M\u03a6 activation status influences their antigen presentation function to CD8 + T cell in models of virus infection. Consequently, we tested how polarization of spleen-derived (Sp)-M\u03a6 impacts direct presentation of viral antigens to influence effector and proliferative CD8 + T-cell responses. We show that M(IL-4) Sp-M\u03a6 retain MHC-I surface expression and the ability to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production by CTL following peptide stimulation and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection to levels similar to M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6. However, memory CD8 + T cells cultured in the presence of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 underwent significantly reduced proliferation and produced similar IFN-\u03b3 levels as coculturing with M0 or M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells. Thus, these results show a novel ability of polarized M\u03a6 to regulate CD8 + T-cell proliferation and effector functions during virus infection.",

Therefore, to demonstrate plasticity of Sp-M\u03a6, we characterized the biochemical properties profiles of polarized BM-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6 following IFN-\u03b3 (16 h) + LPS (8 h) or IL-4 stimulation (24 h).

Nevertheless, LCMV has evolved mechanisms to interrupt APC activation and costimulatory molecule expression (32) . Therefore, in order to assess the ability of polarized Sp-M\u03a6 to engage CD8 + T-cell receptors, we characterized surface expression of activated Sp-M\u03a6 markers following 24 h of LCMV infection ( Figure 1B) . With regard to CD80 expression, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells increased surface levels following viral infection, while M(IL-4) cells expression of CD80 remained largely unchanged (column 1). Interestingly, M0 cells slightly decreased CD86 expression following LCMV infection compared with M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) cells where no change was detected (column 2). M0 cells exhibited slight MHC-I reduction but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or M(IL-4) Sp-M\u03a6 (column 3). In addition, we also assessed expression of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1 (column 4). We observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells expressed the greatest levels of PD-L1, while M0 and M(IL-4) had similar expression levels, which confirmed data in BM-M\u03a6 published by another group (33) . LCMV infection increased expression of PD-L1 in M0 and M(IL-4), while reduced expression in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) Sp-M\u03a6. These data demonstrate that polarized cells are not negatively affected by LCMV infection when considering CD80/86 or MHC-I expression, while LCMV increases inhibitory molecule PD-L1 expression in M2 and M0 cells, but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3).",

In this system, SIINFEKL-K b -specific TCR ligation results in binding to the IL-2 promotor and expression of downstream Lac-Z that can be detected by colorimetric changes (38) . Using two different concentrations of the SIINFEKL peptide (10 \u22127 and 10 \u22129 M), we observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 populations elicited B3Z activation better than M0 and M(IL-4) ( Figure 2C ).

Moreover, in agreement with immunodominance hierarchy reported for this model (41) , there was a greater percentage of IFN-\u03b3-secreting GP33-41-specific CD8 + T cells than NP396-404 T cells (Figures 3A,B) . This finding was identical irrespective of the activation M\u03a6 state even at low-peptide concentrations of 10 \u22129 M. We further tested IFN-\u03b3 induction in LCMV-memory-specific CD8 + T cells using the LCMV GP33-41 peptide. After ex vivo stimulation by GP33-41 pulsed M\u03a6, we found that M(IL-4) cells were able to elicit similar activation of the memory T cells compared with M0 (data not shown). Therefore, we were able to demonstrate that M(IL-4)-M\u03a6 polarization does not negatively influence their ability to stimulate activation and release of IFN-\u03b3 from antigen-specific effector or memory CD8 + T cells after virus infection.",

This protein was not detected immediately during the first hour presenting cells when interacting with CD8 + T cells, we discovered that they were proficient in presenting either peptides or processing viral antigens in different model systems.

These publications utilized culture systems with M(IL-4) BM-M\u03a6 and na\u00efve P14 CD8 + T cells (specific for GP33-41) or anti-TCR and anti-CD28 antibodies to artificially stimulate na\u00efve CD8 + T-cell proliferation in an antigen-independent fashion proliferation (28, 29) .

In addition, M(IL-4)-polarized BM cells were shown to inhibit CD3/CD28-activated na\u00efve CD8 + T-cell proliferation, and impair proliferation of na\u00efve LCMV-specific transgenic (P14) CD8 + T cells in a helminth/norovirus coinfection model (28, 29) . However, not much is known regarding how polarized M\u03a6 influence antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 secretion and memory CD8 + T-cell recall responses after antigen presentation has ensued, particularly during viral infection. To this end, using the well-defined LCMV model, our study uncovers a dichotomous (56) (57) (58) . Moreover, L-arginine deprivation yields a G0-G1 arrest by preventing increases of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) levels (58) . Thus, M(IL-4) cells have the ability to modulate T-cell proliferation by contact-dependent and contactindependent mechanisms.",

Interestingly, supplementing the coculture medium with additional IL-2 restored CD8 + T-cell proliferation and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 secretion upon restimulation. The most likely explanation for this finding is likely due to the ability of IL-2 to tune TCR sensitivity and regulate cell-cycle progression. With regard to TCR sensitivity, exogenous IL-2 restores basally depressed CD3\u03b6 expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (59) . Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that IL-2 reduces the threshold of activation in CD8 + T cells promoting responsiveness to low antigen levels (60) . Therefore, by adding IL-2 we ostensibly improved the TCR sensitivity to antigen. In terms of cell cycle, IL-2 enhances expression of cyclin D3 and CDK4, and activates CDK2 promoting cell-cycle progression into S phase (61, 62) . Therefore, it is plausible that additional IL-2 overrides the M(IL-4) cell-induced CD8 + T-cell impairments by increasing CD3\u03b6 expression and promoting entrance into cell cycle. In agreement with this notion, delivery of IL-2 complexed to anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody breaks established CD8 + T-cell tolerance in an FBL model of murine leukemia (63) . As such, future research into the biological mechanisms of our reported novel finding that IL-2 can overcome M(IL-4) stimulatory deficits CD8 + T cell is of immense interest to the immunotherapy field.",

However, as ligand concentration increases, so does the diversity of cytokine response and proliferation levels (64, 65) .

(a) Nitrite detection after BM-M\u03a6 or Sp-M\u03a6 were polarized into M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or M(IL-4), or left unstimulated (left panel). Supernatants were collected before testing them for nitrite production using the Greiss reaction. The OD was measured using Varioskan plate reader to quantify nitrite production after comparing the values to the standard curve. In the right panel, urea production was measured in polarized BM-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6 samples to monitor arginase activity indicative of M(IL-4) polarization. Values are represented as \u03bcg urea corrected to \u03bcg cell lysate. Data shown and error bars are the mean \u00b1 SD from one representative experiment out of three.

Notably, we detected a reduction in LCMV-NP expression in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) polarized cells compared with M0 and M2 (Figure 4A)indicating that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells were likely inhibiting viral replication as described elsewhere.After 24 h of LCMV infection, we assessed the antigen presenting capacity of polarized M\u03a6 compared with M0 to epitope-specific CTLs. From the data shown in(Figures 4B,C), M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells activated GP33-41-and NP396-404specific CTLs to levels similar to M0 and M(IL-4) cells. Thus, to our surprise M(IL-4) cells were very potent stimulators IFN-\u03b3 release from both GP33-41-and NP396-404-specific CD8 + T cells following viral infection.

However, we observed a substantial reduction of LCMV-NP in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells. This is likely owing to the upregulation IFN-\u03b3-induced anti-viral genes inhibiting the replication of capacity of LCMV described(55). M(IL-4) cells effectively processed and presented de novo synthesized antigens to activate GP33-41-and NP396-404-specific CTL. However, when polarized cells were cultured with splenocytes cells from LCMV-immune mice, M(IL-4) cells stimulated the lowest level of CD8 + T-cell proliferation, a deficit that was overridden by increasing the levels of exogenous IL-2 added to the culture system. Collectively, these observations highlight how polarized M\u03a6 modify CD8 + T-cell function and are of particular importance to the design of cell-based immunotherapies.The suppressive effects of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 on T-cell proliferation have been reported in the literature where M(IL-4) cells prevented proliferation of EL4 and D10.G4 T cells through an undefined cell-contact-dependent mechanism during nematode infection(52). Subsequent gene analysis revealed several M(IL-4)-specific markers including program death ligand (PD-L2), resistin like molecule (RELM)-\u03b1 and YM-1, regulating CD4 + T-cell and CD8 + T-cell proliferation(28,29,54). Moreover, in vitro M(IL-4) M\u03a6 express high levels of Arginase-1 and can also interrupt TCR signaling through L-arginine deprivation(56). For instance, coculture of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 with Jurkat T cells or spleen T cells for 24 h resulted in the downregulation of CD3\u03b6 T-cell surface expression and inhibition of CD4 + T-cell proliferation",
