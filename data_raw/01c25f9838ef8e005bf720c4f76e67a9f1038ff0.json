            "text": "Background: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species-in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. Results: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. Conclusions: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.",

Viral infection of a cell begins with attachment of the virus to the cell surface [6, 10, 11] . During attachment to the cell membrane, the viral envelope protein (a structural protein) interacts with the host-cell receptor protein(s) [12] . In non-envelope viruses, the capsid plays this role. The cell receptors that play a major role in viral attachment are predominantly membrane proteins of the immunoglobin superfamily [13] [14] [15] . The identification of virusbinding cellular receptors was rapidly accelerated in the late 1980s owing to developments in the use of monoclonal antibodies and molecular cloning techniques [15] . The various receptors that have been found are surface matrix structures containing carbohydrate, lipid, and protein moieties [1, 16, 17] . In some cases, viral attachment also exploits co-receptors. For example, HIV, which uses the CD4 molecule as its receptor, uses the CXCR4 and CCR5 co-receptors to strengthen the effectiveness of infection [1, 14, 18, 19] . Similarly, hepatitis C virus utilizes CD81 as a receptor and LDLR as a coreceptor [20] .",

Here, we analysed zoonotic and non-zoonotic RNA viruses along with their cellular receptors in human and (non-human) primary reservoir species to extract the receptor characteristics common to zoonosis. Viruses not previously reported to infect humans were classified as non-zoonotic viruses. We excluded all viruses known to utilize co-receptors; i.e., only virus-receptor interactions occurring through virus tropism and pathogenesis were considered [5, 21] . The receptors and viruses examined in this study are listed in Table 1 . We hypothesized that the major barrier to the transmission of viruses between species is the difference in cellular receptor sequences. In other words, the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor should be the major determinant of the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. Ordinary sequence alignment protocol tells us overall sequence similarity which we thought useful but insufficient because most receptors are membrane proteins and membrane proteins consist of distinctive hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Therefore, we analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species to predict the likelihood of transmission across species, including humans. To our best knowledge, this study is the first attempt to predict zoonosis through a simple analysis of receptor sequence similarities and differences. This method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.",

Similarly, for leukovirus, only Gallus gallus (chicken) is infected as a primary reservoir; because of the high transmission barrier, R. norvegicus and H. sapiens are not infected.

Groups 1, 2 and 3 are each well separated in the colour-coded two-dimensional space. The results provide clear evidence that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well separated from those of other infection cases. From these observations, we conclude that receptor differences are a major contributing factor to the potential of a specific viral strain to cross species barriers for transmission. In other words, the species dependence of infection is indirectly related to the receptor sequence similarity. This finding implies that once the receptor sequences of the primary reservoir and possible hosts are known, we might be able to predict the likelihood of viral disease transmission. The accuracy of these classifications can be judged Figure 1 Similarity scores of among groups. Three kinds of pairwise similarity scores ( g S i,1 , g S i,2 , g S i,3 ) are plotted in two dimensional space to show clear differences among groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 are each well separated; the results show clearly that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well distinguished from those of other infection cases.",

This result is not surprising, because viral infection also inversely correlates with the inhibition of viral coat protein binding to the receptors. Importantly, we were able to establish this relationship at the amino acid sequence level, allowing for the prediction of possible human infection at an early stage of a viral outbreak, before the structures of viral coat proteins and receptors are known. Therefore, once the receptor sequences of primary reservoir and the potential host are known, the likelihood of viral infection can be predicted if the virus does not mutate too abruptly. Our simplistic approach needs further refinement because the complex processes of host tropism of viruses are largely ignored in our current method. For example, the process of host immune response could be included for better prediction of zoonosis. Although further refinements of our methods and analyses of larger databases are needed, this simple conceptual approach may be useful, even now, as a basic tool for the classification of zoonosis of new viral species.",

Such a process begins with the binding of coat proteins to host receptors, and in some cases, coreceptors [24] . Ten RNA viruses (seven zoonotic viruses and three non-zoonotic viruses) were investigated. Viruses that use co-receptors were excluded from the study. Receptor sequence data for each virus were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, and the research literature was examined to determine the specific species tropism of each virus [[25] , http://www.ictvonline.org/]. The viruses, host species, receptors, receptor sequences, and infection information for each host are shown in Table 1 . We selected viruses that are each a representative of a different family, with different primary reservoirs. Viruses with unknown or poorly defined host receptors (particularly human receptors) were excluded from the study. Orthologues of the where N tot is the total number of amino acids in one sequence string; n tot is the total number of matched amino acids in the sequence; N phi and N pho are the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids in the sequence, respectively; N others is the number of deleted amino acids (gaps/insertions in sequence) plus the number of amino acids with undetermined properties; n phi and n pho are the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids matched, respectively; and g S i,1 is the similarity score for hydrophilic residues of the i th row of infection group g. Here, there are only three groups: g = 1, 2, or 3, which are the infection, non-infection, and near-infection groups, respectively. The interspecies infection information was identified and classified among three infection states: group 1 (g = 1) represents infection; group 2 (g = 2) represents non-infection; and group 3 (g = 3) represents nearinfection. By definition, if a group 1 species pair includes humans, then the infection is zoonotic. Decisions for grouping were made on the basis of experimental and epidemiological studies reported in the literature [4, [30] [31] [32] [33] .",
