A report prepared by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2016 estimated that over 10 years the global costs of epidemics could amount to US$600 billion, or 0.7% of global income. The cost of a severe pandemic like the 1918 influenza pandemic could total as much as 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP). Even when the health impact of an outbreak is relatively limited, its economic consequences can quickly become magnified [3] . Liberia, for example, saw GDP growth decline 8% from 2013 to 2014 during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, even as the country's overall mortality rate fell over the same period [4] .",

Moreover, preclinical development is a complex, multistep, and time-consuming process. This represents the second bottleneck in the vaccine development process and involves selection/screening of appropriate antigens and verification of efficacy in the an- imal models. This is followed by process development to ensure that a scalable, robust, and good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant process is established. Material generated at the end of preclinical development can be used for animal toxicology studies and forms the basis of a clinical trial application [18] . The traditional clinical trial phases require significant investment and resources to be executed, and the lengthy nature of the process could itself be described as a bottleneck. Many EIDs are prone to sporadic outbreaks in which morbidity and mortality are high, and it is sometimes not possible to conduct traditional phase III efficacy trials due to ethical considerations and the scale and unpredictable nature of EID outbreaks [18] . To meet the unique challenges of vaccine development for EIDs, an innovative, efficient global system of vaccine research and development (R&D) for EIDs is needed [10] .",

Consequently, evidence of vaccine efficacy may need to rely, either in part or fully, on data from validated animal models acceptable to regulatory authorities. In 2002 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized the Animal Efficacy Rule (also known as the Animal Rule), which applies to the development and testing of drugs and biologicals to reduce or prevent serious and life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal agents for which human efficacy trials are not feasible or ethical [28] . According to this rule, the FDA relies on animal studies to provide substantial evidence of product effectiveness akin to a traditional phase III clinical efficacy study. This route of licensure still requires human safety and immunogenicity, however. To rely on animal efficacy, much work needs to be done to build the foundation of data, such as natural history studies of one or more of the animal species selected, a reasonably wellunderstood mechanism for the toxicity of the pathogen, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data sufficiently well understood to allow the selection of an effective dose in humans [29] .",

            "text": "Vaccines are a powerful tool with substantial potential to prevent and control outbreaks of EIDs. However, a key issue is to be able to manufacture and test a safe and efficacious vaccine for the immediate threat within a very short time frame. Prior to CEPI's establishment, vaccine development efforts for EIDs were fragmented, with no sustainable mechanism to support successful projects across the vaccine development life cycle nor to coordinate work toward the highest-priority global epidemic risks. CEPI was created to fill these gaps and to stimulate, finance, and coordinate the development of vaccines against EIDs, especially in cases where market incentives alone were failing to drive needed development.",

            "text": "From its creation, CEPI developed a business plan to advance vaccine candidates to the PoC stage (by supporting phase I and II clinical trials) to enable clinical efficacy testing (phase III) during outbreaks. It is also CEPI's intent to contribute to technical and institutional platforms that can accelerate the R&D response to EIDs. CEPI will continue to coordinate closely with the WHO and to work together with the international community to advance vaccine candidates against EIDs with epidemic potential, to establish and maintain investigational stockpiles of promising candidates, and to implement scientifically robust trials of these candidates during outbreaks.",

Ausbr\u00fcche von EID, wie der Ebola-Ausbruch in Westafrika 2013-2016 oder der aktuelle Ebola-Ausbruch in der Demokratischen Republik Kongo seit August 2018, stellen nicht nur eine gesundheitliche Bedrohung f\u00fcr die Bev\u00f6lkerungen dar, sie haben auch erhebliche Auswirkungen auf das Wirtschaftswachstum in den betroffenen Regionen und dar\u00fcber hinaus, und stellen somit eine wachsende Bedrohung f\u00fcr die globale Gesundheit dar. Die Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) ist eine innovative globale Partnerschaft zwischen \u00f6ffentlichen, privaten, philanthropischen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Organisationen. Ihre Gr\u00fcndung basiert auf den Konsensus, dass ein koordinierter, internationaler und zwischenstaatlicher Plan erforderlich ist, um neue Impfstoffe zu entwickeln, einzusetzen und so zuk\u00fcnftige Epidemien zu verhindern. CEPI konzentriert sich auf die Unterst\u00fctzung von Impfstoffkandidaten gegen die in der Blueprint-Liste der Weltgesundheitsorganisation angef\u00fchrten Erreger. Das aktuelle Portfolio umfasst eine Vielzahl von Technologien, die von rekombinanten viralen Vektoren \u00fcber Nukleins\u00e4uren bis hin zu rekombinanten Proteinen reichen. Um die Entwicklung von Impfstoffen zu unterst\u00fctzen und zu beschleunigen, konzentriert sich CEPI auch auf wissenschaftliche Projekte im Zusammenhang mit der Entwicklung biologischer Standards und Assays, Tiermodellen, epidemiologischen Studien und Diagnostika sowie auf den Aufbau von Kapazit\u00e4ten f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige klinische Studien in entsprechenden Risikogebieten.",
