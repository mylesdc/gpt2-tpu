One question is whether clustering in networks, roughly defined as the propensity for triangles to form, affects the dynamics of disease spread. We perform a simulation study to see if there is a signal in epidemic transmission trees of clustering. We simulate susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemics (with no re-infection) over networks with fixed degree sequences but different levels of clustering and compare trees from networks with the same degree sequence and different clustering levels. We find that the variation of such trees simulated on networks with different levels of clustering is barely greater than those simulated on networks with the same level of clustering, suggesting that clustering can not be detected in transmission data when re-infection does not occur.",

Conversely, it is possible to learn something about host population structure by observing the pattern of pathogen spread within it. In either case, it is necessary to have a good model of the host population structure and interactions within it. Networks, where nodes of the network represent hosts and edges between nodes represent contacts across which pathogens may be transmitted, are now regularly used to model host interactions [1] [2] [3] . While many models have been proposed to describe the structure of these contact networks for different populations and different modes of transmission, it is not yet understood how different features of networks affect the spread of pathogens.",

            "text": "One promising development in this field is the use of statistical techniques which aim to model a contact network based on data relating to the passage of a pathogen through a population. Such data includes infection times [4] [5] [6] and genetic sequences that are collected from an epidemic present in the population of interest [7] [8] [9] . These data have previously been shown to be useful for reconstructing transmission histories (the distinction between a contact network and a transmission history is that a contact network includes all edges between hosts across which disease may spread, whereas the transmission history is just the subset of edges across which transmission actually occurred). Infection times can be used to crudely reconstruct transmission histories by examining which individuals were infectious at the time that any particular individual was infected [10] . Genetic sequences from viruses are informative about who infected whom by comparing the similarity between sequences. Due to the random accumulation of mutations in the sequences, we expect sequences from an infector/infectee pair to be much closer to each other than sequences from a randomly selected pair in the population (see [11] for a review of modern approaches to analysing viral genetic data). The work of [4] [5] [6] seeks to extend the use of this data to reconstruct a model for the whole contact network rather than just the transmission history. In theory, these statistical methods could settle arguments about which features of the network are important in the transmission of the disease and which are simply artifacts of the physical system.",

The answer to this question will determine whether these new statistical techniques can be extended to estimate the level of clustering in a network. Throughout, we consider a population with N individuals that interact through some contact process. This population and its interactions are fully described by a undirected random network, denoted Y , on N nodes. An simple example of a network is shown in Figure 1 with illustrations of some of the terms we use in this article. Y can be represented by the symmetric binary matrix [Y ij ] where Y ij = Y ji = 1 if an edge is present between nodes i and j, otherwise Y ij = 0. We stipulate that there no loops in the network, so Y ii = 0 for all i. The degree of the ith node, denoted d i is the number of edges connected to i, so d i = j:j>i Y ij .",

Intuitively, clustering is the propensity for triangles or other small cycles to form, so that, for example, a friend of my friend is also likely to be my friend. Where there is a positive clustering effect, the existence of edges (i, j) and (i, k) increases the propensity for the edge (j, k) to exist, while a negative clustering effect implies that (j, k) is less likely to exist given the presence of (i, j) and (i, k). When there is no clustering effect, the presence or absence of (i, j) and (i, k) has no bearing on that of (j, k). Thus clustering is one of the most basic of the true network effects-when it is present, the relationship between two nodes depends not only on properties of the nodes themselves but the presence or absence of other relationships in the network.",

            "text": "The effect of clustering on the dynamics of stochastic epidemics that run over networks remains largely unknown, though it has been studied in a few special cases. The difficulty with studying this effect in isolation is in trying to construct a network model where clustering can change but other properties of the network are held constant. In simulations we study here, we focus on holding the degree sequence of a network constant-that is, each node maintains the same number of contacts-while varying the level of clustering. Intuition suggests that clustering will have some effect on epidemic dynamics since, in a graph with no cycles, if an infection is introduced to a population at node i and there is a path leading to j then k, k can only become infected if j does first. However, where cycles are present, there may be multiple paths leading from i to k that do not include j, so giving a different probability that k becomes infected and a different expected time to infection for k. Figure 1 . An example of a network on 7 nodes. The nodes are the red dots, labelled 1 to 7 and represent individuals in the population. The edges are shown as black lines connecting the nodes and represent possible routes of transmission. The degree of each node is number of edges adjacent to it, so that node 5 has degree 3 and node 7 has degree 1. The degree sequence of the network is the count of nodes with a given degree and can be represented by the vector (0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1) showing that there are 0 nodes of degree 0, 2 of degree 1, 0 of degree 2 and so on. A cycle in the network is a path starting at a node and following distinct edges to end up back at the same node. For example, the path from node 6 to node 1 to node 3 and back to node 6 is a cycle but there is no cycle that includes node 4. Clustering is a measure of propensity of cycles of length 3 (triangles) to form. Here, the edges (2,1) and (2,6) form a triangle with the edge (1,6), so work to increase clustering in the network. However, the edges (2,1) and (2,5) do not comprise part of a triangle as (1,5) does not exist, so work to decrease clustering. Previous work on the effect of clustering on epidemic dynamics has produced a variety of results which are largely specific to particular types of networks. Newman [14] and Britton et al. [15] show that for a class of networks known as random intersection graphs in which individuals belong to one or more overlapping groups and groups form fully connected cliques, an increase in clustering reduces the epidemic threshold, that is, major outbreaks may occur at lower levels of transmissibility in highly clustered networks. Newman [14] , using heuristic methods and simulations, suggests that for sufficiently high levels of transmissibility the expected size of an outbreak is smaller in a highly clustered network than it would be in a similar network with lower clustering. These articles show that graphs with different levels of clustering do, at least in some cases, have different outbreak probabilities and final size distributions for epidemic outbreaks.",

An increase in the variance of the degree distribution has previously been shown to lower the epidemic threshold. They demonstrate that a rewiring of random intersection graphs that preserves the degree sequence but decreases clustering produces networks with similarly lowered epidemic thresholds and even smaller mean outbreak sizes.

The impact of clustering on the probability and size of an outbreak is found to be small on \"reasonable\" networks so long as the average degree of the network is not too low. The rate at which the epidemic spreads, measured by the reproduction number, R 0 , is found to reduce with increased clustering in such networks.

Assortativity has been shown to affect epidemic dynamics and changing the level of clustering in a network can change the level of assortativity. To distinguish between the effects of assortativity and clustering, a method of producing networks with arbitrary degree distributions and arbitrary levels of clustering with or without correlated degrees is presented and studied using percolation methods. The effect of increasing clustering in these models is to reduce the probability of outbreaks and reduce the expected size of an epidemic. Badham and Stocker [23] use simulated networks and epidemics to study the relationship between assortativity and clustering. Their results suggest that increased clustering diminished the final size of the epidemic, while the effect of clustering on probability of outbreak was not very clear. Like [23] , Moslonka-Lefebvre et al. [24] use simulations to try to distinguish the effects of clustering and assortativity but look at directed graphs. Here, they find that clustering has little effect on epidemic behaviour.",

Power-law networks are commonly used to model social interactions and various estimates of \u03b1 in the range 1.5-2.5 have been claimed for observed social networks. In the model used here, we set \u03b1 = 1.8. We simulate power-law using a Reed-Molloy type algorithm [28] .

Node i is then assigned d i \"edge stubs\" and pairs of stubs are sampled uniformly without replacement to be joined and become edges. When all stubs have been paired, loops are removed and multiple edges between the same nodes are collapsed to single edges.

A transmission tree, a distinct graph from the contact network, has a time component and can be defined as follows; an example of a transmission tree and the notation is given in Figure 2 . There are three types of nodes in a transmission tree (not to be confused with nodes in the contact network): the root node corresponding to the initial infection, transmission or internal nodes corresponding to transmission events, and leaf or external nodes corresponding to recovery events. Leaf nodes are defined by the time and label pair (t i , u i ) where t \u2265 0 is the time of the recovery event and u i is the label of individual that recovered. The internal nodes are associated with the triple (t i , u i , v i ) being the time of the event, t i , the label u i of the exposed individual and v i that is the transmitter or \"parent\" of the infection. The root node is like an internal node but the infection parent is given as 0, so is denoted (t 0 , u 0 , 0). The branches of the tree are times between infection, transmission and recovery events for a particular vertex. For example, if the individual labelled u is infected at event (t 1 , u, v 1 ), is involved in transmission events (t k , v k , u), k = 2, . . . , m \u2212 1, and recovers at (t m , u) where t i < t j for i < j and {v 1 , . . . , u m\u22121 } are other individuals in the population, there are m \u2212 1 branches of the transmission tree at u defined by the intervals (t i , t i+1 ], for i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1. We summarise the transmission tree using the following statistics: the mean branch length between internal nodes (corresponding to the mean time between secondary infections for each individual); the mean branch length of those branches adjacent to a leaf node (which corresponds to the mean time from the last secondary infection to removal for each individual); the number of secondary infections caused by each infected individual (that is, for each infected individual v we count the number of internal nodes that have the form (t i , u i , v), for some i); and, the distribution of infective descendants for each individual, v, which is defined recursively as the sum of secondary infections caused by v and the secondary infections caused by the secondary infections of v and so on. An equivalent definition is to say that number of infective descendants of v is the number of leaves that have a node of the form (t, u i , v) as an ancestor. Finally, we consider the number of cherries in the tree [33] which is the number of pairs of leaves that are adjacent to a common internal node. This simple statistic is chosen as it is easy to compute and contains information about the topology or shape of the tree. To compare the number of cherries in outbreaks of different size, we look at the ratio of extant cherries to the maximum possible number of cherries for the given outbreak.",

            "text": "The distributions of the measured clustering coefficients is shown in Figure 3 and show that the simulated networks with high and low clustering for a given degree distribution are easily distinguished from one another. The Bernoulli networks with low clustering contain no triangles, so the clustering coefficient for each of these networks is zero, while for highly-clustered Bernoulli networks, clustering coefficients are in the range (0.28,0.33). For the power-law networks, the low clustered networks have clustering in the range (0.00,0.09) while the highly clustered networks have clustering in the range (0.24,0.38). Figures 4 and 5 show comparisons of summary statistics for networks with differing levels of clustering and Bernoulli degree distributions. The summaries show some differences between the outbreaks on the differently clustered networks. In particular, the outbreaks in the highly-clustered networks spread more slowly, on average, leading to marginally longer epidemics with fewer individuals infected at the peak of the outbreak, that occurs slightly later, than we see in outbreaks on the networks with low clustering. These mean effects are in line with the predictions of [22] . The variances of the measured statistics, however, are sufficiently large due to stochastic effects in the model that the ranges of the distributions overlap almost completely in most cases. Statistics derived from the transmission tree appear to add little information, with only the number of cherries differing in the mean. Figures 6 and 7 show the corresponding distributions for networks with power-law degree distributions. Again, differences in the means between the two sets of statistics are apparent with the mean length of epidemic, total number infected and number infected at peak all lower in the epidemics on networks with high-clustering. The largest difference is found in the total number infected, where in the low-clustered networks, the range of the statistic is (231, 445) while it is just (211, 361) in the high-clustered networks. The primary cause here is due to the change in size of the largest connected component of the network. If we adjust for this by looking instead at the proportion of the giant component infected, the distributions again overlap almost completely with the range for the proportion infected in the low-clustered networks being (0.39, 0.74) and (0.42, 0.74) for the high-clustered networks.

            "text": "The results presented above suggest that the behaviour of an epidemic on a random network with a given degree sequence is relatively unaffected by the level of clustering in the network. Some effect is seen, but it is small relative to the random variation we see between epidemics on similarly clustered networks. The results also suggest that the complete transmission tree from an epidemic provides little information about clustering that is not present in the epidemic curve. These results do not imply that clustering has little effect, rather they suggest as noted in [16] , the apparently strong effect of clustering observed by some is more likely to due to a change in the degree distribution-an effect we have nullified by holding the degree sequence constant. These broader effects are probably best analysed on a grosser level such as the household or subgroup level rather than at the individual level at which clustering is measured. Our simulation method, in which the degree sequence for each network is held constant while clustering levels are adjusted, places significant restrictions on the space of possible graphs and therefore clustering coefficients. The levels of clustering achieved in the simulations reported here (for example, having a clustering coefficient in the low-clustered Bernoulli case of 0 versus a mean of 0.30 for the high-clustered case) are not so high as those considered in the some of the simulations and theoretical work described in Section 1, and this may partly account for the limited effect on epidemic outcomes that we find here. There is little known about the levels of clustering found in real contact networks [31] (though one recent detailed study [34] find values for clustering in a social contact network in the region 0.15-0.5) and no evidence to suggest that very extreme values of clustering are achieved for a given degree sequence. It is plausible, however, that the degree sequence of a social network of interest could be found-for example, via ego-centric or full-network sampling [34] [35] [36] -and therefore reasonable to explore the achievable levels of clustering conditional on the degree sequence. In doing so, we separate the effects on epidemic dynamics of change in the degree sequence of the contact network from those of clustering.",

This is primarily due to the large stochastic variation found from one epidemic to the next that masks the relatively modest effects of clustering on an outbreak. With this much stochastic noise, we suggest that it would require data from many outbreaks over the same network (that is, pathogens with a similar mode of transmission spreading in the same population) to infer the clustering level of that network with any accuracy. The results also suggest that attempting to estimate a clustering parameter without either estimating or fixing the degree sequence, as in Goudie [37] , may see the estimated clustering parameter acting chiefly a proxy for the degree sequence.",

A more realistic data set might include times of onset and recovery from disease symptoms for some individuals in the population and sequences taken from viral genetic material. The noise that characterises such data sets already makes it difficult to accurately reconstruct the transmission tree; this extra uncertainty would likely make any inference of a clustering parameter, in the absence of other information, very difficult.",
