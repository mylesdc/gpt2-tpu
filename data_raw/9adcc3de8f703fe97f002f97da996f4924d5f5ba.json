In accordance with the resolution at the 58 th World Health Assembly (WHA) entitled Strengthening Pandemic Infl uenza Prepared ness and Response [6] , Barbados developed a National Infl uenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPS) in August 2006 [7] . In September 2007, a pandemic fl u outbreak training workshop was held and a pandemic manual was subsequently developed. Th is manual was later revised by a team of managers of the public community health centres, and a two day seminar was held in April 2009 for private and public sector health care professionals to launch this protocol and to educate participants regarding the appropriate response to dangerous infectious diseases. Th ese measures were accomplished through technical cooperation with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Caribbean Epidemiological Centre (CAREC).",
