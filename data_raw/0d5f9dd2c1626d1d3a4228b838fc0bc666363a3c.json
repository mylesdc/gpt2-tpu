In etiologic studies with convincing evidence, a series of such fatal diseases in humans have been confirmed or hypothesized to be caused by bat-borne viruses such as Hendra virus (HeV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus, and coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Similarly, fetal diseases a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 in livestock have also been associated with emerging viruses of bat origin, such as the fatal disease outbreak of pigs in China, which was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), from bats [11, 12] . Furthermore, it was shown that influenza-like viruses, termed H17N10 and H18N11 circulating among bats in Central America, may act as an ancient influenza reservoir [13, 14] . It is well accepted now that bats harbor an exceptionally high proportion of zoonotic viruses with interspecies transmission potential [15] that have the potential to become virulent pathogens for humans. However, studies from wild or experimental bats indicate that most of these lethal viruses in humans and other mammals cause only asymptomatic infection in bats, suggesting a potentially special immune system in bats that is different from most other mammals [16, 17] .",

            "text": "Studies of comparative genomics and transcriptomics confirm that the critical components of the innate and adaptive immune system are conserved and functional in bats [18, 19] . However, a large number of bat-unique characteristics related to immunity and antiviral responses have recently been identified. The most notable immune features involve the absence of key natural killer (NK) cell receptors and dampened cell signaling of type I interferons (IFNs) [18] [19] [20] . Meanwhile, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways, has a substitution in bats, compared with other mammals, that leads to decreased IFN activation [21] . Meanwhile, bats also possess special features to maintain an effective immune state. The genome analysis of Rousettus aegyptiacus revealed a dramatic difference from their functional gene counterparts in other mammals [19] . Indeed, bat IFNs and some IFN-stimulated genes are constitutively transcribed or maintain detectable expression levels in the absence of stimulation [22] [23] [24] . These characteristics may allow bats to fine-tune innate defense responses against insults by viral, bacterial, or host cytosolic DNA while avoiding excessive inflammation. However, the adaptive immune system in bats is less well studied.",

Epitopes or peptides are accommodated in the six pockets (A-F) of peptides/MHC I complexes, which were initially defined in humans [27] . Pocket A anchors the amine group of the amino terminal residue of the bound peptide, pocket B binds the side chain of peptide residue two, and pocket F accommodates the side chain of the carboxyl terminal residue [28] . In bats, the partial map of the Pteropus alecto MHC I region shows that MHC I genes are highly condensed and present within only one of the three highly conserved class I duplication blocks [29] . Genomic analyses of R. aegyptiacus demonstrate an expanded and diversified set of MHC I genes, with MHC I genes found outside the canonical region [19] . Sequences analyses, based on bat MHC I genes identified thus far, show that many of these bat MHC I molecules have a 3-or 5-amino acid (aa) insertion in the \u03b11 domain compared with other mammals [20, 29] . In the R. aegyptiacus genome, it is shown that 11 of the 12 MHC class I loci identified display the 3-aa insertion and only one locus without the insertion. Interestingly, one of the 11 MHC class I loci with 3-aa insertion is located in the canonical MHC alpha loci, indicating that both the MHC class I molecules with and without insertion can present the canonical binding surface [19] . Furthermore, the binding peptide motif of MHC I Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 derived from P. alecto has been identified. It displays a preference for peptides with Pro at their C terminus, which has never been seen in MHC I proteins of any other vertebrates [30] . However, the molecular basis for the peptide binding and presentation by bat MHC I remains unclear.",

First, bat MHC I genes contain a 3-or 5-aa insertion within their peptide binding groove (PBG) compared with those from a variety of other mammals (i.e., between Trp 51 and Ile 52 of human HLA-A \ufffd 0201) (Fig 1A and 1B) .

The 5-aa insertion is unique to bat sequences, while the 3-aa insertion is present in both bats and some marsupials (82.61% of the opossum MHC I, 50% of the koala MHC I, and 100% of both tammar wallaby and Tasmanian devil MHC I contain the 3-aa insertion).

For the MHC I molecules of the higher mammals, the residue at the position corresponding to 59 (position 56 of human, NHP, mouse, and horse MHC I) is a highly conserved Gly. However, 71.43% of bat MHC Is have an Asp 59 or Glu 59 (59D/E) at this position ( Fig 1C) . The pairing of Asp 59 and Arg 65 (D59+R65) also occurs at a high fraction (35.71%) in bat MHC I compared with the MHC I of humans (0%), NHP (0%), mouse (0%), and horse (0%). Actually, the pairing of the charged residues at these two positions include different types: the negatively charged residues Asp/Glu at 59 paired with positively charged residues Arg/Lys at 65, and even positively charged residue Arg/Lys at 59 paired with Asp/Glu at 65 (as gene EPQ18390.1 in Myotis brandtii).

The previously determined Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-binding peptides derived from HeV were also included as a positive control [30] . The binding capacity of these peptides were evaluated by their ability to facilitate the in vitro renaturation of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01. Generally, the peptides with higher binding capability to MHCs would have a higher production of the heterotrimer MHC complexes but lower production of \u03b2 2 -microglobulin (\u03b2 2 m). Seven peptides from MERS-CoV, five from EBOV, one from H17N10, and the two HeV-derived peptides helped Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 naturally refold (Fig 2) . The lengths of the Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-binding peptides cover a range from octamers to tridecamer.

Comparing HeV1/ Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 renatured with bat \u03b2 2 m and human \u03b2 2 m, the structural conformations of both HeV1 peptides in the two structures are also similar, with an RMSD of 0.228 \u00c5 in the two binding grooves (Fig 3E) . In addition, the overall structures are quite similar, with the RMSD of 0.564 \u00c5 of all atoms ( Fig 3F) . And the key residues binding to \u03b11\u03b12 domains and \u03b13 domain Further analysis shows Trp60 in bat \u03b2 2 m binds to Gln99 and Asp125 in Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 when forming a complex, which is also conserved in human \u03b2 2 m when binding to Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 ( Fig 3G) . It indicates that the structure of the peptide loaded in the groove of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 was not affected by the substitution of the \u03b2 2 m subunit. We also determined the structure of monomer bat \u03b2 2 m without MHC I ( Table 1 ). The structure alignment of bat \u03b2 2 m monomer with \u03b2 2 m subunit in MHC complexes indicates a minor conformational shift of the loop resides Ser55 to Tyr63 in bat \u03b2 2 m after forming a complex (Fig 3H) .",

The P1 Asp of all of the peptides adopts a rigid conformation upward to the \u03b11-helix of the heavy chain. In the structure of the Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01/MERS-CoV-S3 complex, the conformation of the P3-P8 residues of the peptide could not be determined due to their poor electron densities (S3F Fig), revealing a flexible conformation in the middle region of this MERS-CoV-S3 peptide. However, the other three residues (P1-Asp, P2-Phe, and PO-Pro) with electron densities available adopt similar conformations as in the other five structurally determined peptides. As a 9-mer peptide, MERS-CoV-S3 possesses a Glu at P6, corresponding to the P6-Asn in 9-mer HeV2, which is the secondary anchor residue. The larger Glu may not be able to locate in the PBG, which leads to a flexible conformation of the MERS-CoV-S3.",

The thermal stability of the resulting heterotrimers was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig 4H  and 4J , S3 Table) . Substitution of Ala at P1 (HeV2-D1A), P2 (HeV2-Y2A), and P9 (HeV2-P9A) of peptide HeV2 led to nearly no refolding for Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, whereas Ala at P1 (HeV1-D1A), P2 (HeV1-F2A), and P8 (HeV1-P8A) of peptide HeV1 still supported refolding but with significantly lower stability than the original peptide. In contrast, substitution of Ala at P5 of HeV1 (HeV1-T5A) and at P6 of HeV2 (HeV1-N6A) led to similar yield of refolded heterotrimers, indicating a similar stability compared with the original peptides. Thus, through these analyses, the P1 anchor of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-binding peptides seems to be as significant as the P2 and PO anchors.",

This is uncommon in the peptides bound by MHC I molecules from other mammals. The structures of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 with the 9-mer peptides HeV2 (DYINTNVLP) and H17N10-NP (DFEKEGYSL) showed that both of the peptides adopt similar overall conformations as the HLA-A \ufffd 0201-presented 9-mer peptide GL9 (GILGFVFTL) with a Leu at the PO site ( Fig 6A) . However, to the best of our knowledge, no peptide motif with a Pro at the PO position has been reported for HLA-A \ufffd 0201. Detailed comparative analysis of the F pockets of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 and HLA-A \ufffd 0201 revealed that the F pocket of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 is shallow but with a wide opening (Fig 6B-6E To verify the allele-specific preference of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 for peptides with Pro at the PO site, we examined the binding ability of HLA-A \ufffd 0201 to a mutated GL9 peptide, GL9-L9P, with a Pro at P9 (Fig 6F and 6G) . We found GL9-L9P has a weaker capacity to help the HLA-A \ufffd 0201 refold, and the generated heterotrimer complex has lower midpoint transition temperature (T m ) (38.1\u02daC) compared with the wild-type peptide GL9 (55.8\u02daC) with a Leu at PO. Thus, although Pro at PO may also act as a suboptimal anchor for HLA-A \ufffd 0201, Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 uses Pro as one of its optimal PO anchors. The analysis of the 20 different component amino acids for the proteins from the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV indicated that Pro possesses a relatively low mutation rate compared with the other amino acids (Fig 6H) . The mutation rate of Pro is only higher than Trp and Gly, which are the largest and smallest residues, respectively. It indicates that, as special residues Trp and Gly, the residue Pro may also keep the natural conformation and function of viral proteins. In other words, structural constraints favoring conservation of Pro in certain positions of proteins may operate to preserve viral protein conformation and function. Thus, its mutation rate is restricted. The selection of Pro as the anchor residue of bat MHC I Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01presented peptides may restrict the viral mutation pushed by T-cell immunity and accelerate virus clearance.",

However, when we superimposed the structures of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 onto the previously determined structures of HLA-A \ufffd 2402 and H-2K d , we found that the P2 anchors of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 protrude in a different direction (Fig 7A) . The HLA-A \ufffd 2402-and H-2K d -presented peptides have a Tyr or Phe pointing to the C terminus of the PBG, while the Tyr or Phe of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-binding peptides swing toward the N terminus of the PBG (Fig 7C and 7D) . Comparison of the amino acids lining the B pockets of these MHC I molecules from different mammals demonstrated that Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 possesses a Tyr 9 (compared with the small residues Ser 9 in HLA-A \ufffd 2401 or Val 9 in H-2K d ), which takes up space and can push a P2-Tyr or -Phe to the other direction ( Fig 7B) . Furthermore, compared with the residues Met 45 in HLA-A \ufffd 2402 or Phe 45 in H-2K d , the Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-specific Ala 45 leaves a large space to accommodate the P2-Tyr or -Phe. Indeed, detailed analyses showed that the P2-Tyr of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-binding peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the \u03b2-sheet on the floor of the PBG. In contrast, the P2-Tyr of HLA-A \ufffd 2402-restricted peptides bind to the side chain of His70 on the \u03b11-helix (Fig 7B) . Sequence superimposition of the bat MHC I with other mammal MHC Is indicated that Ala 45 is prevalent (41%) among bat MHC I molecules but is never seen in human and mouse MHC I (S2A Fig). ",

The subsequent determination of the structures of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 complexed with peptides from these viruses revealed unusual peptide presentation features of bat MHC I. Interestingly, this uncommon feature of pocket A of bat MHC I may be shared by the MHC Is from different marsupials.

But more significantly, this insertion site is located at a position called 3 10 helix (residues 49-53); newly synthesized MHC I molecules complexed with \u03b2 2 m are poised in the endoplasmic reticulum in a peptide-receptive (PR) form, ready to bind and be stabilized in the mature peptide-loaded (PL) form by peptides destined for display at the cell surface. The movement of a hinged unit containing a conserved 3 10 helix promotes the PR transition state to a PL mature molecule [31] . Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity peptides onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. TAP binding protein (TAPBPR; related) remodels the peptide-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity peptide [32] . In the absence of TAPBPR, Y84 (Y87 in Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01) plays a role in closing of the \u03b12-1-helix \"latch\" by associating with the C terminus of bound peptides in the F pocket, the release of nonoptimal peptides induced by TAPBPR [33] . However, the hydrogen bond network of the A pocket could stabilize peptides with P1-Asp during peptide processing and exchange and high-affinity peptides are guided by initial contacts spanning both the A-and F pockets to form a prolonged interaction within the groove, resulting in a closure of the \u03b12-1 helix latch, which triggers TAPBPR release from the peptide/MHC I complex.",

Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that a series of bat MHC I molecules have an insertion in the N terminus of the PBG compared with other higher mammals [29] . Herein, our structural study visually shows that the 3-aa insertion in the bat MHC I leads to an extension of the \u03b11-helix. This conformational change causes the protrusion of the bat-specific residue Asp 59 into the A pocket of the PBG, which forms a hydrogen bond network with the Arg 65 and the peptide P1-Asp. Study of the peptide repertoire of key human and mouse MHC I alleles demonstrates that anchor Asp is disfavored at the P1 position of the peptides [36] . In contrast, recently reported data on the peptide elution from bat MHC I molecules [30] , together with viral peptide screening results in this study, demonstrate that bat MHC I Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 prefers peptides with a P1-Asp. Either depletion of the three inserted residues (Met 52 Asp 53 Leu 54 ) or substitution of the P1-Asp with Ala impaired the MHC/peptide binding. Indeed, the electrostatic nature of the contacts between Asp 59 , Arg 65 , and P1-Asp and the fact that it is involved in solvent-exposed elements in pocket A of the MHC complex suggest that the P1-Asp acts as a \"surface anchor residue.\" This surface anchor residue was also previously defined in a phosphopeptide-MHC complex [37] in which the solvent-exposed P4 phosphate moiety can enhance the stability of the peptide-MHC association. The additional surface anchor residue for the bat MHC I binding peptides may have at least two advantages for antiviral T-cell immunity. First, the peptides tightly bind to Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 and present a special peptide-MHC landscape at the N terminus of the peptides for the T-cell recognition. Second, negatively charged residues such as Asp/Glu in the peptides may also act as key residues in the original viral proteins for virus replication, which will have lower mutation rates to escape T-cell recognition. In addition, the insertion of Met 52 Asp 53 Leu 54 also leads to a special exposed landscape of the \u03b11-helix of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01. Thus, heterozygous bats with MHC I alleles of both 3-aa insertion and no insertion may possess a T-cell repertoire with broader diversity, which need more work to investigate.",

The evolution of the MHC I gene family is closely tied to the evolution of the vertebrates genome [38] . However, the 3-aa insertion and the charge-matching residues at positions 59/65 of MHC Is are also prevalent among different marsupials: opossum, koala, tammar wallaby, and Tasmanian devil. This may be a phenomenon of convergent evolution under the pressure of related pathogens. To comparatively investigate the peptide presentation of MHC I from marsupials, we have synthesized a marsupial MHC I gene (Trvu-UB \ufffd 01), which has similar characteristics to 3-aa insertion and charge-matching residues at positions 59/65 to Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, and also the small residue G at position 80 (S7A Fig). However, the preference of the Trvu-UB \ufffd 01 protein for peptides may not be similar to that of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 (S7B Fig) . This result indicates that although some alleles of MHC I from the marsupials possess the same key residues in the PBG of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, the preferred peptide motifs are only partially similar between them (Pro as PO), which may reflect the contribution of some other adjacent residues. Thus, the detailed peptide motifs and the presentation features of MHC Is from these lower mammals still require further laboratory investigation. Meanwhile, whether the 5-aa insertion in the bat MHC I impacts the peptide presentation in the same manner as 3-aa insertion or with a new molecular mechanism needs more structural studies. In this context, it is also worth mentioning that we also tried two additional online MHC-peptide binding predicting servers, NetMHCpan and Rosetta FlexPepDock, to verify the peptide-binding experiments in the study. However, neither prediction server was able to match the experimental results. This may indicate that current MHC binding peptide predictions were not suitable for non-mouse and nonhuman mammals such as bats, which may have a different manner of peptide binding.",

            "text": "Like the human and murine MHC I [2, 39] , Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 has B and F pockets in the PBG to accommodate the primary anchors of the binding peptides, but uncommon conformational features of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-loaded B and F pockets were identified through our structural investigations. The B pocket of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, featuring the bat-specific residue Ala 45 , has a novel position in the PBG for the P2 anchor. In this position, the P2-Tyr of the peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the \u03b2-sheet on the floor of the PBG of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, which leads to a stable anchoring of the P2-Tyr. Meanwhile, Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01, with a relatively unique Gly at position 80, has an unusually shallow F pocket with a wide entrance, like a large bowl, which can accommodate the uncommon PO-Pro anchor. To the best of our knowledge, although the PO-Pro anchor is not observed in the previously reported peptides from mammalian MHC I, the precedents for the P2-Pro anchor have been reported in the context of murine H-2L d and human B \ufffd 3501 and B \ufffd 5301 [40] [41] [42] . Requirements for Pro in the P3 position as an anchor residue are also observed in the murine H-2D d -and macaque Mamu-A \ufffd 01-restricted epitopes [43, 44] . A previous study indicates that the antiviral effect of T cells is sufficiently strong to force the virus to adopt a relatively unfavorable mutation, which reduces viral replication [45] . The proline anchor may be a result of special antigen processing in bats. For humans, most products of ornithine decarboxylase degraded in vitro by the 26 S ATP-dependent proteasome, which contained one or two Pro residues, implied that the Pro residue has a role in the escape from random cleavage by proteasomes [46] . In addition, Pro residue(s) within epitopic sequences presumably contribute to efficient production of MHC class I ligands through prevention of their random cleavage by proteasomes [47] . Thus, the peptides with proline as a C terminus are still seldom in human and other common mammals. However, the current research on the proteasome of bats is still blank. Our data also showed that among the 20 different component amino acids for the proteins from the bat-related viruses, the residue Pro possesses a relatively low mutation rate compared with the other amino acids (Fig 6H) . Pro, with a unique conformation, may act as a key residue for the structure and function of viral proteins, and thus its mutation rate is low. Therefore, the usage of Pro as the PO anchor of the T-cell epitopes in Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01-carrying bats may also restrict the formation of escape mutations. However, based on the currently limited amount of bat MHC I sequences available, Gly 80 in the F pocket does not seem prevalent in bat MHC I. More sequencing of bat genomes and especially MHC I genes are needed to verify whether the accommodation of PO-Pro as a peptide anchor is common in bat MHC I or a specific feature of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01.",

The conserved conformations of residues in the P1, P2, and PO positions are shown in yellow ellipses. Most conformational distinctions are located in the central region of the peptides, marked by a yellow rectangle. (G-J) The capacity of HeV1 (G), HeV2 (I), and their Ala substitutions for binding to Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 was evaluated by in vitro refolding. The thermostabilities of Ptal-N \ufffd 01:01 with HeV1 (H) and HeV2 (J) peptides and their Ala substitutions were tested by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
