This new infectious agent is more likely to affect older males to cause severe respiratory diseases 7, 8 . Some of the clinical symptoms were different from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that happened in 2002-2003, indicating that a new person-to-person transmission infectious agent has caused this emergent viral pneumonia outbreak 8, 9 . Chinese researchers have quickly isolated a new virus from the patient and sequenced its genome (29, 903 nucleotides) 10 . The infectious agent of this viral pneumonia happenening in Wuhan was finally identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans 11 . On 11th February 2020, WHO named the novel viral pneumonia as \"Corona Virus Disease (COVID19)\", while the international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) suggested this novel coronavirus name as \"SARS-CoV-2\" due to the phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis of this novel coronavirus 12 .",

The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the \u03b2-CoV 23, 24 . 2019-nCoV explored in Wuhan also belongs to the \u03b2-CoV according to the phylogenetic analysis based on the viral genome 10, 11 . Although the nucleotide sequence similarity is less than 80% between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (about 79%) or MERS-CoV (about 50%), 2019-nCoV can also cause the fetal infection and spread more faster than the two other coronaviruses 7, 9, 11, [25] [26] [27] . The genome nucleotide sequence identity between a coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) detected in the bat Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, China, and 2019-nCoV, was 96.2%, indicating that the natural host of 2019-nCoV may also be the Rhinolophus affinis bat 11 . However, the differences may also suggest that there is an or more intermediate hosts between the bat and human. A research team from the South China Agricultural University has invested more than 1 000 metagenomic samples from pangolins, and found that 70% pangolins contained \u03b2-CoV 28 . One of the coronaviruses they isolated from the pangolins comprised a genome that was very similar with that from 2019-nCoV, and the genome sequence similarity was 99%, indicating that the pangolin may be the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV 29 .",

The S protein from coronavirus can bind to the receptors of the host to facilitate viral entry into target cells 31, 32 . Although there are four amino acid variations of S protein between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV can also bind to the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the same host receptor for SARS-CoV, as 2019-nCoV can bind to the ACE2 receptor from the cells from human, bat, civet cat, and pig, but it cannot bind to the cells without ACE2 11, [33] [34] [35] . A recombinant ACE2-Ig antibody, a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, and the serum from a convalescent SARS-CoV-infected patient, which can neutralize 2019-nCoV, confirmed ACE2 as the host receptor for 2019-nCoV [36] [37] [38] [39] . The high affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S protein also suggested that the population with higher expression of ACE2 might be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV 40, 41 . The cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 also contributed to the S-protein priming of 2019-nCoV, indicating that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute a treatment option 36 .",

In addition to the infected patient's cough and breathing, dental devices such as high-speed dental handpiece uses high-speed gas to drive the turbine to rotate at high speed and work with running water. When dental devices work in the patient's oral cavity, a large amount of aerosol and droplets mixed with the patient's saliva or even blood will be generated.

To date that this paper was drafted, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has released the 5th edition of the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. In general, a patient with COVID-19 who is in the acute febrile phase of the disease is not recommended to visit the dental clinic. If this does occur, the dental professional should be able to identify the patient with suspected 2019-nCoV infection, and should not treat the patient in the dental clinic, but immediately quarantine the patient and report to the infection control department as soon as possible, particularly in the epidemic period of 2019-nCoV. The body temperature of the patient should be measured in the first place. A contact-free forehead thermometer is strongly recommended for the screening. A questionnaire should be used to screen patients with potential infection of 2019-nCoV before they could be led to the dental chair-side. These questions should include the following: (1) Do you have fever or experience fever within the past 14 days? (2) Have you experienced a recent onset of respiratory problems, such as a cough or difficulty in breathing within the past 14 days? (3) Have you, within the past 14 days, traveled to Wuhan city and its surrounding areas, or visited the neighborhood with documented 2019-nCoV transmission? (4) Have you come into contact with a patient with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection within the past 14 days? (5) Have you come into contact with people who come from Wuhan city and its surrounding areas, or people from the neighborhood with recent documented fever or respiratory problems within the past 14 days? (6) Are there at least two people with documented experience of fever or respiratory problems within the last 14 days having close contact with you? (7) Have you recently participated in any gathering, meetings, or had close contact with many unacquainted people?",

Although appropriate hand hygiene is the routine prerequisite for dental practice, hand-washing compliance is relatively low, which imposes a great challenge to the infection control during the epidemic period of 2019-nCoV transmission. Reinforcement for good hand hygiene is of the utmost importance. A two-beforeand-three-after hand hygiene guideline is proposed by the infection control department of the West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, to reinforce the compliance of hand washing. Specifically, the oral professionals should wash their hands before patient examination, before dental procedures, after touching the patient, after touching the surroundings and equipment without disinfection, and after touching the oral mucosa, damaged skin or wound, blood, body fluid, secretion, and excreta. More caution should be taken for the dental professionals to avoid touching their own eyes, mouth, and nose.",

Since 2019-nCoV is vulnerable to oxidation, preprocedural mouthrinse containing oxidative agents such as 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone is recommended, for the purpose of reducing the salivary load of oral microbes, including potential 2019-nCoV carriage.

When rubber dam is applied, extra high-volume suction for aerosol and spatter should be used during the procedures along with regular suction 59 . In this case, the implementation of a complete four-hand operation is also necessary.

The rapidly increasing number of cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission suggested that the virus was more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 9,25,27,61 . By mid-February 2020, a large number of infections of medical staff have been reported 62 , and the specific reasons for the failure of protection need to be further investigated.

We have summarized the possible transmission routes of 2019-nCov in stomatology, such as the airborne spread, contact spread, and contaminated surface spread. We also reviewed several detailed practical strategies to block virus transmission to provide a reference for preventing the transmission of 2019-nCov during dental diagnosis and treatment, including patient evaluation, hand hygiene, personal protective measures for the dental professionals, mouthrinse before dental procedures, rubber dam isolation, anti-retraction handpiece, disinfection of the clinic settings, and management of medical waste.",
