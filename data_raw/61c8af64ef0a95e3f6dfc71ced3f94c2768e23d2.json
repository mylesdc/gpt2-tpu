In light of the broad antiviral activity of \u03b2-defensins, we tested the antiviral activity of 11 peptides derived from mouse \u03b2-defensin-4 and found that a short peptide, P9, exhibited potent and broadspectrum antiviral effects against multiple respiratory viruses in vitro and in vivo, including influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The antiviral activity of P9 was attributed to its high-affinity binding to viral glycoproteins, as well as the abundance of basic amino acids in its composition. After binding viral particles through viral surface glycoproteins, P9 entered into cells together with the viruses via endocytosis and prevented endosomal acidification, which blocked membrane fusion and subsequent viral RNA release. This study has paved the avenue for developing new prophylactic and therapeutic agents with broad-spectrum antiviral activities.",

The antiviral activity of \u03b2 -defensins is thought to be mediated through either indirect interaction or direct interaction with viral glycoproteins and/or envelopes 14, 15 . For example, \u03b2 -defensins could indirectly interact with viral receptors and/or glycoproteins through the target cells to inhibit virus-receptor binding or virus-cell membrane fusion or to down-regulate cell-signaling pathways required for viral replication 15, 16 . \u03b2 -defensins might also directly interact with viral glycoproteins and/or disrupt viral envelopes to inhibit viral entry into the target cells 17, 18 . Recently, we also found that mouse \u03b2 -defensin-4 (mBD4) has strong in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects against H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses and SARS-CoV (unpublished data).",

Among all short peptides, P9 showed the strongest antiviral activity (Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, the dose-dependent antiviral effect of P9 was stronger than those of synthetic mBD4 (smBD4) and recombinant mBD4 (rmBD4). In particular, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of P9 was 1.2 \u03bc g/ml, which was lower than those of smBD4 (3.2 \u03bc g/ml) and rmBD4 (1.5 \u03bc g/ml) (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, the 50% toxic concentrations (TC 50 ) of P9, smBD4 and rmBD4 were 380, 280 and 360 \u03bc g/ml, respectively (Fig. 1c) . The selectivity index of P9 was 316, which was higher than those of smBD4 (87) and rmBD4 (240). Notably, both of the liquid form and powder form of P9 demonstrated stable shelf lives as they exhibited similar antiviral activity after storing at \u2212 20 \u00b0C for more than 1 year ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Taken together, among smBD4, rmBD4 and the 11 peptides derived from mBD4, P9 exhibited the highest antiviral activity and selectivity index. Thus, P9 was selected for further studies.",

The dose of 50 \u03bc g/mouse was applied for animal experiments because it was shown to protect all mice from lethal challenge of H1N1 virus. The survival rate of P9-pretreated mice (100%) was significantly higher than those of rmBD4-pretreated mice (20%, P < 0.01) and untreated mice (0%, P < 0.0001). Notably, pretreatment with P9 and Zanamivir achieved a similar protection effect (Fig. 2a) . In parallel, when the mice were i.n. inoculated with 3 doses (50 \u03bc g/dose/day) of P9, rmBD4 or Zanamivir at six hours after the lethal challenge with the virus (Fig. 2b) , the survival rate in P9-treated mice (60%) were significantly higher than those of untreated control and rmBD4-treated mice (P < 0.05). In this setting, treatment of zanamivir yielded a similar level of protection (80%) in comparison to P9 (P > 0.05). All infected mice suffered from body weight lost regardless of treatment types. However, the survived mice began to regain body weight at ~10-12 days post-infection (Fig. 2c,d) .",

To further dissect how P9 interfered with influenza virus infection, we asked whether virus-receptor binding, endocytosis or viral RNA release was affected by P9.

The inhibitory activity was directly determined by plaque assay and the infection ratio was calculated as plaque numbers in treated samples/plaque numbers in untreated samples. The IC 50 s are indicated by dotted line, indicating that the mean IC 50 s of P9, smBD4 and rmBD4 are 1.2 \u03bc g/ml, 3.2 \u03bc g/ml and 1.5 \u03bc g/ml, respectively. (c) The cytotoxicity of P9, smBD4 and rmBD4 was determined by MTT assay. TC 50 s are indicated by dotted line. All data are presented as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. for 3 hours. We found that P9-pretreated virus bound to the cellular membrane in a similar manner compared to the untreated virus ( Fig. 5a , left). P9-pretreated virus entered the cells through endocytosis after the virus was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour (Fig. 5a , middle). Furthermore, the transport of the virus in endosomes from the cell periphery to the proximity of the nucleus was not affected when the virus was pretreated by P9 ( Fig. 5a , right). The colocalization of the virus with P9 further confirmed the binding of P9 to the virus, its internalization into cells and its subsequent transport to the perinuclear region together with the virus (Fig. 5b ). On the other hand, the levels of viral RNA in infected cells remained essentially unchanged during the first 2 hours post-infection regardless of P9 treatment (Fig. 5c ), suggesting that P9 did not inhibit viral binding and entry. The viral RNA levels in cells infected with untreated virus increased at 3.5 hours post-infection, indicative of the initiation of nascent viral RNA replication. In contrast, the viral RNA levels in the cells infected with P9-pretreated virus did not increase until 6.5 hours post-infection and was significantly lower than that of untreated virus control (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5c ). These results implicated that P9 perturbed viral uncoating and viral RNA release from late endosomes for subsequent replication.",

Bearing in mind the basic amino acid-rich composition of P9, we examined whether P9 could block viral RNA release by counteracting endosomal acidification. As shown in Fig. 6a , P9 showed similar antiviral effects in comparison to ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) and Bafilomycin A1, which are well-defined inhibitors of endosomal acidification [21] [22] [23] . In contrast, Zanamivir, which inhibits viral release, did not show a similar antiviral kinetics in comparison to the endosomal acidification inhibitors. Therefore, P9, NH 4 Cl and Bafilomycin A1 might share a similar antiviral mechanism of inhibiting pH decrease in endosomes. To confirm this hypothesis, we detected the pH change in endosomes using a pH-sensitive dye, the intensity of which mirrored the acidity of the cellular milieu. Red signals in the cells infected with untreated virus (VC) indicated the acidification process in endosomes (Fig. 6b) . In contrast to the control, when the cells were infected with virus pretreated with P9, NH 4 Cl or Bafilomycin A1, little to no any red signals were observed, indicating that acidification was abolished in the endosomes. To verify this, we designed a P9 analog named P9-aci-1 containing three additional acidic amino acids at the C-terminus (Table 1 ). If P9 acts through perturbation of pH lowering, the addition of acidic residues is expected to relieve the perturbation and abrogate the consequent antiviral effect. Indeed, confocal microscopic images indicated that pH lowering in endosomes was unaffected by P9-aci-1 (Fig. 6b ). In line with the imaging result, P9-aci-1 lost its antiviral activity (IC 50 > 100 \u03bc g/ml). In addition, the polykaryon assay further showed that P9 did not directly inhibit HA-cell membrane fusion ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Hence, when delivered into the endosomes, virus-bound P9 prevented pH decrease, resulting in the inhibition of viral RNA release and subsequent replication.",

These results indicated that P9 has broad-spectrum antiviral activities in vitro against multiple respiratory viruses. We further evaluated the protective effect of P9 against infections of H5N1, H7N9 and SARS viruses in mice. As shown in Fig. 7c , one dose (100 \u03bc g/mouse) of P9 for prophylaxis (P9-P) and 5 doses (100 \u03bc g/mouse) of P9 for therapy (P9-T) could protect 44% and 50% of mice from lethal challenge of H5N1 virus, respectively. These protection rates were significantly higher than that of untreated mice (P < 0.05) and comparable with the mice treated with prophylactic and therapeutic Zanamivir (Zana; 50% and 60%, P > 0.05). One dose of P9 for prophylaxis and 5 doses of P9 for therapy protected 50% and 50% of mice from lethal challenge of H7N9 virus, respectively. The treatment groups provided significantly more protection than the control group (P < 0.01). The survival rates of mice treated with prophylactic and therapeutic Zanamivir were 60% and 70%, respectively, which did not show significant difference compared to those of P9-treated mice (P > 0.05) (Fig. 7d) . The body weight of all treated and untreated mice began to decrease at day 2 post-challenge and then gradually recovered from day 12 post-infection in the survival mice (Fig. 7e,f) . Since we have not established animal models for lethal infection of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, we compared the viral load in mouse lungs at day 3 post-infection in a mouse model of non-lethal SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 7g ,h, one dose of P9 for prophylaxis and 5 doses of P9 for therapy significantly inhibited virus infection in mouse lungs compared to that in the untreated mouse lungs ",

It was particularly noteworthy that P9 displayed potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects in mice (Fig. 2) . The production of recombinant BDs is hampered by high cost and low recovery rate (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). In contrast, P9 can be chemically synthesized in high yield and with low cost. Synthetic P9 is highly soluble and stable in water, as well as reasonably stable in vivo, making P9 an ideal lead compound for further development as a novel antiviral drug.",

            "text": "It has been reported that the antiviral activity of BDs might be mediated through either indirect interaction or direct interaction with viral glycoproteins and/or envelopes 14, 15 . We here demonstrated the binding of P9 with viral glycoproteins (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 5 ), but not the target cells (Fig. 4d) . The infection of influenza virus involves multiple steps including virus-receptor binding, endocytosis, transport from early endosomes to late endosomes where acidification results in virus-endosome membrane fusion, subsequent viral disassembly (uncoating), and viral RNA release, which triggers viral RNA replication 12, 22 . We demonstrated that P9 might mitigate viral RNA release from late endosomes to inhibit viral RNA replication (Fig. 5 ). Since pH lowering to 5.0 in late endosomes is critical for virus-endosome membrane fusion 22, 24 , inhibitors of endosomal acidification can efficiently inhibit membrane fusion by suppressing the pH decrease in endosomes 21, 22, 25 . P9 was indeed capable of inhibiting the pH decrease in endosomes in a similar fashion comparing to two well-characterized inhibitors of endosomal acidification, NH 4 Cl and Bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 6) . Thus, our data suggested that P9 inhibited viral RNA release by suppressing pH decrease in endosomes. The antiviral function of P9 mediated through inhibition of endosomal acidification might be independent of the blocking of M2 ion channel, since P9 could efficiently inhibit the infection of three amantadine-resistance strains of influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (Fig. 7) [26] [27] [28] . Importantly, for a substantial number of pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus and coronavirus, virus-endosome membrane fusion is a prerequisite for viral disassembly and viral genome release into host cells to initiate productive viral replication 4, 29 . Membrane fusion is mediated by viral envelope glycoproteins and requires an acidic environment in endosomes 4, 30 . In line with the antiviral mechanism of P9 illustrated in this study, P9 could inhibit infections of other subtypes of influenza A virus including H3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9, as well as two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 7) . Our results also demonstrated that P9 could bind to S2 of MERS-CoV ( Supplementary Fig. 5) , suggesting that the antiviral mechanism of P9 against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was potentially similar to that against influenza virus. We reasoned that P9 might be capable of inhibiting the infection of additional pathogenic viruses, which enter target cells via endocytosis, as long as P9 could efficiently bind to the viral particles.",

The antiviral effect of P9 is mediated through the following mechanism: (1) P9 efficiently binds to viral particles via viral glycoproteins and (2) P9 is rich in basic amino acids, which prevent acidification in endosomes and inhibit viral RNA release. Influenza A virus and coronavirus have caused several fatal pandemics and outbreaks in the past century. Although a number of anti-influenza drugs have been developed, drug-resistant virus strains emerged quickly after these antiviral drugs were put in clinical use. In addition, thus far, no effective antiviral drugs are available for patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 5 . In this regard, antiviral peptides, such as P9, represent new promising prophylactic and therapeutic agents with broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Overall, based on the mechanism illustrated in this study, new antiviral peptides with broad-spectrum antiviral activities may be developed to provide new drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of viral infections. Cloning, expression and purification of rmBD4. The codons of mBD4 were optimized to E. coli-preferred codons based on OPTIMIZER 34 (Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The fragment of mBD4 was generated by PCR-based gene synthesis using 6 oligos ( Supplementary Fig. 7b) . The codon-optimized gene was cloned into PCR2.1 vector and then sub-cloned into PET32a(+ ) at KpnI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) to express thioredoxin-mBD4 fusion protein. Thioredoxin-mBD4 (Trx-mBD4) was released from E. coli by a simple osmotic shock procedure 35 and further purified by AKTA-FPLC (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using His Trap FF column (GE Healthcare) ( Supplementary  Fig. 7c ). Trx-mBD4 was digested with enterokinase to release recombinant mBD4 (rmBD4). rmBD4 was recovered by cation-exchange chromatography using Sp sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). Purified rmBD4 was desalted using PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) into 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) (Supplementary Fig. 7d ).",

The mouse adapted H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses were used for lethal challenge of mice. To evaluate the prophylactic effects, mice were i.n. or i.t. inoculated with PB, P9, rmBD4, or Zanamivir, and then challenged with 3 LD 50 of the virus at 10 min later. For evaluation of the therapeutic effect, mice were challenged with 3 LD 50 of the virus and then i.n. inoculated with P9, rmBD4, or Zanamivir at six hours after the viral inoculation. Two more doses were given to H1N1-challenged mice and four more doses were given to H5N1-and H7N9-challenged mice at 1-day interval. Survival and general conditions were monitored for 21 days or until death. For virological and pathological tests, 3 mice in each group were sacrificed at day 5 after challenge. To evaluate in vivo prophylactic effect of P9 against SARS-CoV infection, nine-month old mice were i.t. inoculated with P9 (100 \u03bc g/mouse) and then challenged with 2 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV. For evaluation of therapeutic effect, mice were challenged with 2 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV and then i.n. inoculated with P9 at 6 hours post-infection. Four more doses were given to the mice in the following two days. Lung tissues were collected at day 3 post-infection for virological assay. All i.t. inoculations were performed using a MicroSprayer Aerosolizer (Penn-Century, USA). At least nine mice in each group were analyzed in all animal experiments.",
