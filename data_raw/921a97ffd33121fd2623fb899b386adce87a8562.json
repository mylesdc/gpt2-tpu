Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42). Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV). Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns. The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature. Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity.",

The elderly and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems have the greatest risk of serious complications from ILI, which can be caused by any one of approximately 200 known viral species [5] .

A laboratory-based influenza-like illness surveillance system is well established in Zhuhai city and has greatly contributed to the control of influenza virus infection due to advanced warning of outbreaks.

            "text": "During 2010, we conducted a one-year surveillance of viral etiology of ILI and found that of 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People's Hospital, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. Of 3,747 outpatients with ILI, 924 (24.66%) had available samples and were enrolled in this study and ranged in age from one month to 78 years. Only two patients were older than 60 years of age, while 536 (58.01%) were under five years old and 308 (33.33%) were between the ages of 5-14. The age distribution of the 924 study participants was representative of the 3,747 patients presenting with ILI ( Figure 1 ). This susceptibility of ILI in the younger age categories may be caused by several reasons. First, the immune system of children under five years old is naive and more susceptible of viral infections. Second, juveniles between the ages of 5-14 are generally students who are denselygathered in schools promoting the spread of respiratory infectious. In addition, their immune systems are also still in development. Third, although aging impacts immunity to viral infection [30] , patients older than 60 years of age usually have some comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or chronic bronchitis, and seek medical attention only when these primary diseases worsen when combined with ARI. Moreover, elderly people may self-administer according to their own experience. Of 924 samples, about 44.48% were positive for at least one virus, which is consistent with previous studies where viruses were detected in a range between 36% and 58% [31] [32] [33] [34] . Among the tested viral pathogens, influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV exhibited characteristic seasonal patterns. In addition, there were correlations between the incidence of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV with air temperature, as well as between incidence of sFluB and air humidity. Therefore, the knowledge from our study is important for planning and implementation of effective interventions, including vaccinations. During the study period, the introduction and emergence of H1N1pdm09 virus occurred, while sFluA (H1N1) was not detected in Zhuhai city. It is possible that the epidemic of H1N1pdm09 interfered with the appearance of sFluA (H1N1). The incidence of H1N1pdm09 was highest in adults between 25-59 years of age in 2010 (10.91%), with significant differences compared to other age groups (P = 0.033). Of the total cases of ILI, 10.39% were infected with sFluB, which was the predominant viral pathogen and occurred mainly from February-May in 2010, corresponding with a previous study of seasonal patterns [35] . Among 308 patients between 5-14 years of age, 66 (21.43%) were infected with sFluB and there was a significant difference in age distribution (P < 0.001). Infection with sFluA (H3N2) occurred predominantly in children less than five years old, which was significantly higher than other age groups (P = 0.009). In addition, the rate of sFluA (H3N2) + RSV was the most common viral co-infection in the respiratory tract of patients with ILI. In accordance with a previous study [36] , the seasonal variability of sFluA (H3N2) was clear, presenting mainly from July-October, perhaps influenced by the epidemic of H1N1pdm09. We found that influenza strains were the most commonly detected viruses in agreement with other studies [37] . In addition, two significant correlations were observed; first, the higher the air temperature, the higher the incidence of sFluA (H3N2) (r = 0.592, P = 0.043), and second, the incidence of sFluB positively correlated with air relative humidity (r = 0.866, P < 0.001). RSV, reported to be almost as common as influenza viruses, had the greatest impact on the youngest age groups [18, 37] and was a major viral pathogen of ILI during the study period. Its incidence was 9.42% (87/924), which is consistent with the result reported by Fry et al. [38] . Our study showed that RSV infection occurred predominantly from January and March and October and December, with the majority of cases in children under five years old (P < 0.001). This is also in accordance with the study by Fry et al. [38] , and RSV was the most commonly detected respiratory viral pathogens in co-infected patients. Additionally, RSV infection was negatively correlated with air temperature (r = \u22120.699, P = 0.011).",

Although the study by van den Hoogen et al. [40] showed that most HMPV infections occur in children less than five years of age, our study did not show a significant difference in age distribution of HMPV infections. Previous studies indicate that the activity of HMPV in temperate climates peaks between December and February [24, 41] , where as in subtropics it peaks in the spring and summer months [42] and the peak of HMPV activity often coincides with or follows that of RSV [21, 23] . In this study from Zhuhai city, located in subtropics, the incidence of HMPV peaked in January and did not follow that of RSV. HMPV infection did not correlate with air temperature unlike RSV, which is similar to another study [43] and was likely impacted by the circulation of H1N1pbm09 virus in Zhuhai city 2010.",

In addition, no significant differences were observed among the different age groups, possibly affected by the epidemic of H1N1pdm09 virus.",

Second, some viruses, such as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, as well as bacteria, such as M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, were not studied. The inclusion of these additional viral pathogens might greatly increase virus detection frequency, as indicated by a previous study [48] that reported a higher proportion of these viruses compared to influenza virus and might explain the relatively high proportion (55.52%, 513/924) of unidentified etiologies in our study.",

Realtime RT-PCR was performed on the ABI 7500 fast sequence detection system and reaction conditions were designed as follows: RT at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C for 15 s) and annealing and extension (60\u00b0C for 40 s).

The percent of admitted patients infected is shown on the y axis as a function of the month on the x axis. In China, the four seasons were generally recognized as spring (March-May), summer (June-August), fall (September-November), and winter (December-February). Respiratory viral agents usually have characteristic seasonal patterns. The peak of sFluA (H3N2) was from August-September, sFluB from March-May, and the peak of H1N1pdm09 occurred in January. RSV infection occurred predominantly from December-February and usually was observed in co-infection with sFluA, sFluB, HMPV, and ADV. PIV and ADV were detected throughout the year without significant seasonality in 2010. The distribution of respiratory viral pathogens in the local climate of Zhuhai during 2010. Zhuhai is located in the southern tip of Mainland China and is a subtropical coastal city with a humid climate and small diurnal air temperature range. The average monthly air temperature ranged[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29].4\u00b0C and the average monthly relative humidity varied between 65.9-90.8% in Zhuhai during 2010. When the temperature rose, the number of patients infected with sFluA (H3N2) and ADV increased significantly (r = 0.592, P = 0.043 and r = 0.699, P = 0.011; respectively). Alternatively, the colder the temperature became, the number of patients infected with RSV increased (r = \u22120.699, P = 0.011). In addition, the prevalence of sFluB was significantly, positively correlated with air relative humidity (r = 0.697, P < 0.001).",
