The detection of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F\u22653) is important to identify patients who are in urgent need of antiviral treatments versus those whose treatment could be deferred (F\u22652). The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of PTX3 as a potential biomarker for clinically significant and advanced fibrosis. PTX3 associations with biochemical and histological parameters of inflammatory activity and fibrosis were investigated in 138 patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) before antiviral treatment. METAVIR histological scores of activity and fibrosis were obtained. PTX3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic accuracy of serum PTX3 levels was compared to that of other fibrosis markers, including transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1 ), hyaluronic acid (HA), aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis score based on four factors (FIB4), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR), and the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (FibroScan5). In HCV patients the PTX3 level increased in parallel with the METAVIR histological score of activity, being independently associated with the METAVIR fibrosis score (P < 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristics analysis, the best marker for detecting F\u22652 and F\u22653 was PTX3 with AUC = 0.802 and AUC = 0.867, respectively. The area under the curve of PTX3 for predicting significant fibrosis (F\u22652) was significantly greater than those for the GPR ratio (AUC = 0.648) and FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.770) and similar to that for APRI index (AUC = 0.831). PTX3 provided clinically relevant diagnostic accuracy as a single marker of significant fibrosis.",

The management of chronic hepatitis depends on the degree of liver fibrosis. Thus, the assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis is important for choosing a therapeutic strategy and for determining the prognosis. Liver biopsy is the gold standard method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis [1] . However, the invasive nature of liver biopsy makes it impractical, especially for patients who require follow-up [2] . Therefore, many reports have demonstrated noninvasive examination methods for assessing the degree of fibrosis in chronic liver disease, which may be alternatives to liver biopsy, such as new serum biomarkers or biomarker panels and transient elastography [3] [4] [5] .",

It is well established that key activators of the inflammatory and reparative response after tissue injury, such as proinflammatory cytokines, damaged tissue-derived signals, and microbial molecules, induce PTX3 production in different cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts, as well as in cells of innate immunity, such as monocytes and granulocytes. Neutrophils store PTX3 in secondary granules and upon appropriate stimulation promptly release it. In a simplistic view, PTX3 plays a crucial 2 BioMed Research International role in inflammation through activation of the complement cascade and inhibition of P-selectin-mediated neutrophils extravasation. Since PTX3, an acute-phase protein rapidly produced by vascular tissues as well as by cells of innate immunity in response to inflammation, is a rapid and reliable marker for primary local activation of innate immunity and inflammation in several disorders, including acute kidney injury, severe acute respiratory syndrome or LPS-induced lung injury, atherosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarction [for more detail, see review [6] ].",

[7] , in agreement with previous reports [8] [9] [10] [11] , have shown a nonredundant protective role of PTX3 in the regulation of tissue repair and remodeling. In various murine models of tissue damage, including skinwound healing, chemically induced sterile liver, and lung injury and arterial thrombosis, PTX3 deficiency was associated with increased clotting as well as with fibrin and collagen deposition/persistence, epithelial hyperplasia, and defective mature tissue formation at healing. This phenotype was attributed to the lack of PTX3-dependent facilitated plasminmediated fibrinolysis by tissue remodeling cells, which is a prerequisite for appropriate tissue repair [7] . In this respect, fibrin and other provisional extracellular matrix proteins are deposited after tissue injury and their subsequent timely degradation is essential for tissue repair [12, 13] .",

The experiments in cell showed that while PTX3 is mainly expressed in neutrophils in healthy liver; in injury it is mainly expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [14] , the main cell type responsible for the reparative response after tissue injury and liver fibrosis [15] . The differential expression of PTX3 in healthy and injured liver together with the data that show that PTX3 drives HSC activation [14] suggest that in response to injury PTX3 released by neutrophils may promote HSC activation. However, in chronic liver disease, activated HSCs would become the main cell type producing PTX3, which may enhance the reparative response after liver injury and exert protective and immune modulatory effects. In light of these observations, further clinical studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of the PTX3 in liver fibrosis.",

We performed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate whether PTX3 was useful to judge the METAVIR fibrosis score or not. Afterward, we examined the correlation of PTX3 with liver function parameters and other conventional fibrosis markers using the Spearman rank correlation. For logistic regression analyses, the value of each independent variable was determined by the Wald chisquare value (Wald), which was calculated by squaring the ratio of the regression coefficient divided by its standard error. The diagnostic value of PTX3 for predicting significant (F\u22652) and advanced fibrosis (F\u22653) or cirrhosis (F=4) was assessed by calculating the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. ROC curves were generated by plotting the sensitivity against 1 \u2212 specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. According to DeLong [24] , the empirical nonparametric method was performed to make pairwise comparisons of ROC curves. Based on the ROC analysis the optimum cut-off point was established by selecting the value that provides the greatest sum of the sensitivity and specificity, i.e., the point closest to the upper left point of the ROC plot. For the optimum cut-off point provided by each ROC analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using standard formulas.

Additionally, using the Spearman rank correlation analysis, a positive correlation between LSM and PTX3 level (rho = 0.53, P < 0.001) was observed (Figure 2(f) ).

This complies with previous studies [16] [17] [18] 30] , which show close associations between PTX3 levels, disease progression, and stages of liver fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and/or alcoholic hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis C. The results of our study further demonstrate that among ten variables, including PTX3 level, platelet count, albumin, AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, INR, HA, and TGF-1, both PTX3 and TGF-1 (a direct fibrosis marker) were the most significant serum markers associated with severity of liver fibrosis. Although there was a positive correlation of PTX3 with the progression of liver fibrosis stage (rho = 0.64, P < 0.001) in our patients with HCV, the results from an in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies [7, 10] suggest that PTX3 exerts a hepatoprotective and a modulatory effect on chronic inflammatory events, taking into account the fact that PTX3 protein and regulation are conserved between mice and humans [31] . One likely explanation of this apparently contradictory result is that PTX3 might be expressed as a strong evidence emerging from studies of Perea et al. [14] suggesting that the liver may be an important source of circulating PTX3. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that PTX3 hepatic gene expression and plasma levels showed a positive correlation in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Independent of their etiology, the common hallmark of chronic liver diseases is chronic inflammation which shows a correlation with the progression of fibrosis. In the injured liver chemotactic stimuli trigger the rapid recruitment of immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils. These infiltrating immune cells then produce numerous proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors, which trigger the activation of myofibroblasts, the main effector cells of tissue remodeling [32] . Accordingly, there are reasons to believe that the increase in circulating PTX3 levels is likely triggered by ongoing production of proinflammatory cytokines at necroinflammatory injury, including IL-1 and TNF-, which are known to be potent inducers of PTX3 release [33] .",

On the contrary, in the CCL 4 -induced liver injury model, PTX3 deficiency did not affect necrosis; however, it was associated with an augmented fibrosis [7] .

The AUCs of reported fibrosis markers (APRI index, FIB-4 score, GPR ratio, HA, TGF-1, and LSM values) increased as the liver fibrosis stages progressed; the AUC of PTX3 increased accordingly as well. The diagnostic performance of PTX3 was significantly better than that of the GPR ratio for detecting F\u22652 with an AUC = 0.802. It is worth noting that PTX3 shows better diagnostic accuracy than the FIB-4 score, but with overlapping confidence intervals; therefore, it is not significantly different. Several studies evaluated the diagnostic performances of FIB-4 score and APRI index as noninvasive algorithms for detecting significant and/or advanced fibrosis [34] [35] [36] . They all obtained similar results as us, except for Wai et al., who found that the mean APRI AUC for significant fibrosis is 0.800 [20] . This APRI test showed that AUCs for detecting significant fibrosis ranged from 0.740 to 0.870, which was similar to the diagnostic performance of PTX3 (0.756-0.906). In light of these observations, results about the possible use of PTX3 as an early marker for predicting fibrosis stages are promising and further both preclinical and clinical studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of the PTX3 in the fibrosis.",

Although the number of patients enrolled might seem relatively small, it adequately represented the sample size estimated to provide the specific power. Secondly, in this study, we excluded patients with fatty liver disease, which may affect the LSM values. Thirdly, major strength of the study is the comparison to FibroScan5 as this novel elastography technique fulfills a number of the requirements of an ideal noninvasive marker of fibrosis. However, FibroScan5 has some limitations such as the lack of standardized cut-off for diagnosing fibrosis stages [32] . Because we relied on a single determination of PTX3, we cannot take into account any variation that may have occurred over time. However, this does not seem to be a major limitation because other fibrosis markers were measured only once in this study. Finally, liver biopsy is prone to sampling errors in the scope of the evaluation of the degree of liver fibrosis, leading to bias. Despite the fact that in this study PTX3 detects significant fibrosis with similar accuracy to that of indirect biomarkers APRI and FIB-4, PTX3 is still clinically relevant as it reflects fibrosis-related inflammation and not liver function such as APRI and FIB-4 calculation (AST and ALT values). Further, recent progress in antiviral treatment has normalized AST and ALT values in many patients even though they still have fibrotic liver [37] . In this context, PTX3 may be of more clinical relevance in terms of the general clinical practices related to the monitoring of patients whose treatment has been deferred to reconsider the indication of treatment and to discuss new therapies as they emerge.",
