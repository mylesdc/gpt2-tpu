Compounds 4 and 5 were evaluated against a panel of bacteria, several Mycobacterium strains, fungi, a set of viruses, and nine different human tumor cell lines. p-Chlorofumardiamide 4d showed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also against Candida albicans (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 6.1-12.5 \u00b5g/mL). Together with p-fluoro and p-CF 3 fumardiamides 4b,f, compound 4d showed activity against Mycobacterium marinum and 4b,f against M. tuberculosis. In biofilm eradication assay, most of the bacteria, particularly S. aureus, showed susceptibility to fumardiamides. m-CF 3 and m-chloroaniline fumardiamides 4e and 4c showed significant antiviral activity against reovirus-1, sindbis virus and Punta Toro virus (EC 50 = 3.1-5.5 \u00b5M), while 4e was active against coxsackie virus B4 (EC 50 = 3.1 \u00b5M). m-Fluoro derivative 4a exerted significant cytostatic activity (IC 50 = 5.7-31.2 \u00b5M). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were highly susceptible towards m-substituted derivatives 4a,c,e (IC 50 = 6.7-8.9 \u00b5M). Biological evaluations revealed that fumardiamides 4 were more active than succindiamides 5 indicating importance of Michael conjugated system.",

The simplest and the best Michael acceptors are \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with exposed unsaturated \u03b2-carbon atoms, such as exomethylene ketones and lactones or vinyl ketones [1] . These fragments are often used in the design of new anticancer drugs, together with others (6-methylhept-5-ene-1,4-dione, propiolamide, 4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamide) (Figure 1 ). They assure the irreversible covalent binding to a cysteine residue of a specific protein and may modulate selectivity and potency of the drug candidate. The targeted covalent modification has emerged as a validated approach to drug discovery with the drug candidate canertinib [2] , approved drugs afatinib, neratinib and osimertinib (inhibitors of human epidermal growth factor receptors) and ibrutinib (Bruton s tyrosine kinase inhibitor) [3, 4] . A comprehensive review published by Jackson et al. gives an overview of biological activity and applicability of various Michael acceptors [5] .",

Once the drug carrier arrives at the targeted cancer tissue, doxorubicin is released from the carrier by the cleavage of hydrazone or glycosidic bond in the acidic environment of cancer cells. The prodrugs demonstrate superior anticancer efficacy than the parent drug.",

Many of them are used in clinical practice or are still under the evaluation in clinical trials (vernolepin, helenalin, curcumin, pyrrocidine, fumaric and angelic acid derivatives), but some are classified as toxins [11] . Vernolepin and helenalin are sesquiterpenes with exomethylene lactones responsible for irreversible DNA polymerase inhibition. Pyrrocidine A is a 13-membered macrocyclic alkaloid produced by endophytic fungi, which directly binds to N-acetyl-L-cysteine methyl ester through the Michael-type addition and exerts both antimicrobial and cytostatic effect on leukemia HL60 cells [12] . Angelic acid ester ingenol mebutate has been identified as the most active component of Euphorbia peplus L. latex sap, effective against human nonmelanoma skin cancer [13] and actinic keratosis [14] . A gel formulation of ingenol mebutate has been recently approved for the treatment of actinic keratosis [15] and fumaric acid esters are used for the management of psoriasis [16, 17] . Curcumin is a symmetric \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b2-diketone extracted from Curcuma longa L., a tropical Southeast Asian plant used as a spice and in traditional Indian medicine [18] . Currently, there are 17 open clinical trials involving curcumin, of which mainly evaluate the combination of curcumin with other substances used in anticancer therapy [19] .",

We have chosen \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated amides because they are less electrophilic than analogous esters and better Michael acceptors [1] . Based on our previous findings [20, 21] , one of the amide bonds was achieved with a terminal amino group of primaquine (PQ), while the other with halogenanilines ( Figure 1 ). Sharing the same conjugated C=C-CO system and a benzene ring, our compounds are similar to cinnamic acid (trans-3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid) derivatives as well. Taking literature data into account [22] [23] [24] and our previous experience with PQ derivatives [20, 21, [25] [26] [27] [28] , we have assumed that the designed compounds have a high pharmacological potential. Here we report their synthesis, evaluation of antimicrobial activity on a wide spectrum of bacteria, fungi and viruses, their biofilm eradication ability, and finally, cytostatic activity against several human tumor cell lines.

Spectral data are consistent with the proposed structures and are given in short in the Materials and Methods and in detail in the Supplementary Material. The presence of carbonyl functional groups in compounds 4 and 5 was indicated by the appearance of strong stretching vibration bands in IR spectra between \u03bd 1677 and 1628 (amide I) and 1555 and 1515 cm -1 (amide II). PQ residue showed characteristic signals in 1 H NMR spectra: hydrogen atom CH-15 occurred between \u03b4 8.52 and 8.55, methoxy group at \u03b4 3.82, the hydrogen attached to chiral carbon (CH-10) as a multiplet at \u03b4 3.57-3.65, a methyl group at \u03b4 1.19-1. 22 . NH-1 appeared as a singlet between \u03b4 9.98 and 10.75 ppm, NH-6 as a triplet at \u03b4 7.86-8.55, while NH-12 as a doublet at \u03b4 6.11-6.15 ppm. 13 C spectra showed characteristic PQ signals at \u03b4 54.92-54.98 (methoxy group), 46. .02 (C-10), 38 .46-39.23 (C-7), 33.37-33.45 (C-9), 25.70-25.99 (C-8), 20.14-20.21 (C-11) ppm and corresponding signals in aromatic region. Two signals of carbonyl groups in fumardiamides 4a-f appeared between 161.17 and 163.34 ppm, while in succindiamides 5a-f between 170.35 and 171.18 ppm. The other two succinic acid carbons (C-3 and C-4) appeared in the aliphatic region between 30.10 and 31.75, and fumaric acid carbons connected by double bond were located very high between 132.11 and 134.66 ppm. CF 3 groups in compounds 4e, 4f, 5e and 5f showed characteristic quartets at 121.32-127.05 with average J = 272 Hz, and the closest C-atom to trifluoromethyl quartets at 124-129 ppm with J = 31 Hz. m-Fluorophenyl derivatives 4a and 5a showed doublets at 162 ppm and p-fluorophenyl derivatives 4b and 5b doublets at 158 ppm (C-atom bearing fluorine) with a similar J-coupling constant of 240 Hz, while two neighbouring C-atoms appeared at 105-110 ppm (average J = 21 Hz). C-atom substituted with chloro atom appeared at 133 ppm (m-Cl) and 127 ppm (p-Cl). Chemical structures of new compounds were also supported by mass spectroscopy. Molecular ion peaks corresponding to expected relative molecular masses were obtained for all compounds.",

However, Gram-negative bacterium A. baumannii was the most susceptible among all tested microorganisms: all compounds, except m-fluoro derivative 4a, showed selective antimicrobial activity against this bacterium strain. Comparison of meta and para derivatives, e.g., a vs. b, c vs. d, e vs. f revealed that in the most cases p-substituted derivatives were more active than the analogous m-derivatives. p-Chlorofumardiamide 4d showed significant activity against three bacterial strains (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and A. baumannii), but also against C. albicans ATCC 90028, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 6.1 to 12.5 \u00b5g/mL.

Two microorganisms, namely E. faecalis and S. aureus showed high susceptibility to all fumardiamides, while E. coli, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to five out of six fumardiamides. A high biofilm eradication potential of fumardiamides might be explained by the reaction of Michael acceptors with cysteine thiol, which could prevent disulfide bond formation. It is a well-known fact that cysteine homeostasis impacts biofilm formation and production of extracellular matrix components, as well as folding and stability of extracytoplasmic proteins [31] . They are also crucial for dental plaque formation, autolysis, extracellular DNA release, genetic competence, bacteriocin production and stabilization of outer membrane porin proteins [32] .",

Succindiamides 5a-f were completely inactive, while free fumardiamides showed activity towards the selected tumor cell lines (Table 4) . Fumardiamide 4a with m-fluoroaniline moiety showed cytostatic activity against all tested cell lines, with IC 50 values from 5.7 to 31.2 \u00b5M (IC 50 = the lowest concentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition). DND-41 cell line was susceptible to all three m-substituted derivatives, e.g., 4a, 4c and 4f (IC 50 values between 6.7 and 8.9 \u00b5M). HL-60 and Z-138 cell lines were also susceptible to compound 4a (IC 50 values 5.7 and 8.4 \u00b5M, respectively). Glutathione (GSH) is an important compound present in most mammalian cells, a tripeptide, with the central amino acid cysteine bearing thiol group, which scavenges carcinogenic compounds by conjugate addition and protects from oxidative damage [1]. In the drug development process, it is usual to evaluate the Michael acceptor-GSH interaction [33] . That is why the final step in our research was to study the interaction of fumarmides with GSH. Fumardiamide 4b (1.25 \u00b5M) was incubated with GSH (125 \u00b5M) in ammonium formate buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 10% acetonitrile at 37 \u2022 C for 216 h. The MS analysis confirmed the consumption of 4b with GSH. However, the rate of GSH addition was slow and incomplete, as only 18.3% of 4b reacted in the monitored period (See Supporting Material).",

Cell suspensions were prepared from stock cultures using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco Laboratories, USA) pH 7.4 and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland units using a nephelometer (ATB 1550, BioM\u00e9rieux, France). Stock solutions of the tested compounds were prepared in DMSO (10 mg/mL). Testing was performed using serial dilution in microtiter flat-bottom 96-well plates with compounds ranging from 100 to 0.78125 \u00b5g/mL. After inoculation (10 7 CFU/mL) and incubation (18 h, 35 \u2022 C, aerobically in darkness), MICs for bacterial species were determined by addition of 0.5 mg/mL TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride). The absorbance was recorded at 540 nm. As a positive quality control (susceptibility of strains) tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added into wells. MICs were determined as non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism as the lowest concentrations resulting in 50% growth inhibition of growth in comparison to control.",

At log phase growth, a culture sample (10 mL) was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm/20 min using a bench-top centrifuge (MPW-65R, MPW Med Instruments, Poland). Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was washed in fresh Middlebrook 7H9GC broth and re-suspended in fresh, ODAC-supplemented MB (10 mL). The turbidity was adjusted to match McFarland standard No. 1 (3 \u00d7 10 8 CFU) with MB broth. A further 1:20 dilution of the culture was then performed in MB broth. The antimicrobial susceptibility of M. tuberculosis was investigated in a 96-well plate format. In these experiments, sterile deionised water (300 \u00b5l) was added to all outer-perimeter wells of the plates to minimize evaporation of the medium in the test wells during incubation. Each evaluated compound (100 \u00b5L) was incubated with M. tuberculosis (100 \u00b5l). Dilutions of each compound were prepared in duplicate. For all synthesized compounds, final concentrations ranged from 1000 \u00b5g/mL to 8 \u00b5g/mL. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and subsequent dilutions were made in supplemented MB. The plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 7 days. Following incubation, 10% of alamarBlue (Difco, Lawrence, KS, USA) was mixed into each well, and readings at 570 nm and 600 nm were taken, initially for background subtraction and subsequently after 24 h reincubation. The background subtraction is necessary for strongly coloured compounds, where the colour may interfere with the interpretation of any colour change. For non-interfering compounds, a blue colour in the well was interpreted as the absence of growth, and a pink colour was scored as growth.",
