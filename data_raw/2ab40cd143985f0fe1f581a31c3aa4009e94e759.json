The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings. Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80% specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the hospital's fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.",

Clinical diagnosis alone may lead to misdiagnosis which can subsequently lead to serious clinical outcome [7, 8] . Several laboratory confirmation tests for dengue infection are currently available, including serological test, virus detection, antigen detection, and genome detection. The use of these tests is still limited since they require sophisticated equipment and well-trained staff [9] [10] [11] . The accuracy of these tests may vary over the course of illness [12] . Since the serological test requires a pair of serum samples taken two weeks apart to confirm a rise in IgM/IgG dengue antibody, this test may not be practical for initial diagnosis of dengue [12] . Other factors could also interfere with the interpretation of the immunological assays, such as history of immunization or previous infection by dengue or other flavivirus. Virus and genome detection can directly identify dengue viral infection. However, virus detection must be performed during the viremic stage, within 1-5 days of onset of fever [1] .",

The accuracy of the NS1 antigen rapid test is considered high with sensitivity 55%-82% and specificity 97%-100%. Since the NS1 rapid test aims to detect dengue NS1 antigen, it should be performed within 5 days of onset of fever. However, this rapid test is not generally performed in many health facilities due to its cost [1] . Even though laboratory confirmation is highly recommended for dengue diagnosis, laboratory tests for dengue infection are generally inaccessible, particularly in resource limited settings. Commonly, physicians make diagnosis of dengue infection based only on clinical signs and symptoms [2] , even though clinical diagnosis is difficult and may vary, particularly among inexperienced physicians [14, 15] .",

Bayesian networks (BN) are one such approach and have been widely applied in medicine due to their ability to effectively handle uncertain information. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of probability distribution in which nodes represent random variables and links represent direct probabilistic influence among the variables [17] . The relation between a node and its parents is quantified by a conditional probability table (CPT), specifying the probability of the random variable conditioned on all combinations of the values of the parents. The structure of the network encodes information about probabilistic independence such that the CPTs along with the independence relations provide a full specification of the joint probability distribution over the random variables represented by nodes. By decomposing a joint probability distribution into a collection of smaller local distributions (the CPTs), a Bayesian network provides a highly compact representation of the complete joint distribution. In BN diagnostic models, factors that can influence the diagnosis, including clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory results are included in the model to form a causal relationship network [18] . Findings are entered into the model as evidence and the posterior probability of disease is computed. Previous studies have shown that Bayesian networks can accurately perform diagnosis and prediction of diseases or health conditions for wide variety of problems [19, 20] .",

In addition, lymphocyte, platelet, white blood cell count, AST/ALT, atypical lymphocyte, and hematocrit are also related to dengue infection. Interestingly, duration of fever prior to diagnosis appeared to influence physician diagnosis of dengue [1] . Clinical symptoms and laboratory results are usually dynamic over the course of illness [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Awareness of this can assist physicians in differentiating dengue patients from other patients. Therefore, our dengue diagnosis BN model also included duration of fever as prior information to determine the effect of clinical and laboratory profiles on the probability of having dengue. Individual background immunological profile for dengue or other flaviviruses due to direct infection or immunization may also determine clinical manifestation of current dengue infection. Since dengue vaccine is just recently available, including history of infection or immunization for dengue or other flavivirus diseases could potentially improve the performance of future BN diagnostic models.",

Although the WHO has recommended the NS1 rapid test as one of the diagnostic tests for dengue infection [1] , the use of the test is still limited due to its high cost and low sensitivity [39] . In general, the result of the NS1 antigen rapid test should be carefully interpreted because its accuracy can change over the course of illness [39] following the dynamics of viral antigen and antibody levels [1] . Therefore, clinical information of patients must be considered along with the NS1 test result. Although 79% of patients in this study came to hospital within 5 days, the NS1 rapid test (dual test) alone showed 54% sensitivity (ability to correctly detect dengue cases) and 95% specificity (ability to correctly detect non-dengue cases). However, when considering patients' clinical and laboratory information in the BN model, the sensitivity to detect dengue cases increased from 54% to 73% while the specificity to correctly identify non-dengue patients decreased but still maintained an acceptable level (from 95% to 79%).",

Data collected specifically for research purposes is likely to be more complete and valid, as compared with data generally collected for medical services. Laboratory confirmation for dengue, including PCR and serology tests, and other common tropical diseases were performed in all patients, which ensured the accuracy of our main outcome, dengue infection. However, using data from only one hospital may limit the generalizability of the results. As the Hospital for Tropical Diseases is a specialized hospital, patients who visited the hospital may be different from other hospitals in terms of disease distribution and patient characteristics. In this study, about 50% of AUFI patients had dengue infection. Whereas, a previous study conducted in Thailand in 2004 reported dengue infection in only 15% of AUFI patients [43] . Nevertheless, data collection in this study was conducted during 2013, when a dengue outbreak was reported throughout Thailand [44] . Moreover, the laboratory diagnosis of dengue in the previous study was based on only serology for dengue serotype 2 and 4 while the present study used both PCR and serology for all serotypes [21, 43] . These could explain the difference in proportion of dengue cases observed in the previous study. A large proportion of dengue infection among AUFI cases in this study can affect the model's ability to correctly predict dengue infection when the model suggests positive for dengue (positive predictive value: PPV). In this study the PPV was 75% and 66% in the BN model with and without the NS1 test, respectively. These values could be lower if the model was applied in areas with a smaller proportion of dengue among AUFI cases. As a specialized hospital, acute febrile patients observed in this hospital may come with unusual manifestations that lead to difficulty in making diagnosis by inexperienced physicians. Therefore, data used in this study would benefit the usefulness of our BN model, in which the model could potentially assist decision making particularly in the difficult cases.",

This suggests relatively low reliability of physician diagnosis [8, 12] . As expert performance in this study was determined by consensus of two or three physicians, the performance of other individual physicians may vary from that observed in this study. Use of a BN diagnostic model could help to increase reliability of the diagnosis.
