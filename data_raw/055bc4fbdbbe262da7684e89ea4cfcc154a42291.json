Nevertheless, the incidence of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae suggests that this process is well controlled. The conditions promoting or stemming self-reactive (SR) T cells following viral-induced tissue damage thus need to be better defined. Using a non-fatal viral mouse model of encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination and disability, yet ultimate clinical improvement, this study set out to monitor uptake and presentation of endogenous myelin antigens, as well as induction and fate of SR T cells.",

Finally, SR T cell activation from the endogenous T cell repertoire was most notable when infectious virus was controlled and paralleled myelin damage. Although SR T cell accumulation peaked in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination, they were not preferentially retained. Their gradual decline, despite ongoing demyelination, suggested minimal re-stimulation and pathogenic function in vivo consistent with the lack of autoimmune symptoms.",

While the etiology of MS remains unknown, various genetic and environmental factors have been associated with MS pathogenesis [3] [4] [5] . Among the environmental cues, viral infections, most prominently Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus type 6, have been linked to initiation or progression of disease [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] ; however, their causal nature remains unclear. Anti-viral antibodies and viral antigens have been detected in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [10] [11] [12] . Nevertheless, active virus replication has yet to be demonstrated in the CNS of MS patients. By contrast, infections have even been proposed to limit autoimmunity [13] . Indeed, the decreased incidence of infectious diseases in the past decades inversely correlates with an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, including MS [14] . For example, viral infection in an animal model of type I diabetes prevents disease development [15, 16] . Similarly, mice bred under conventional conditions are less susceptible to diabetes than mice bred in a pathogen-free environment [14] , supporting the concept that microbiome burden may reduce the incidence of autoimmunity [17] . Therefore, the role of viral infections in autoimmune diseases is complex and remains largely elusive.",

            "text": "Activation of self-reactive (SR) immune cells by epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen, and bystander activation have all been proposed to explain how viral infections may ultimately result in autoimmunity [18, 19] . This is exemplified by the biphasic disease induced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) [20] . Minimal clinical deficits appear during the acute phase of TMEV infection, characterized by neuronal infection. The protective anti-viral immune response fails to completely eliminate infectious virus, resulting in chronic infection of microglia and macrophages [21] , ascending paralysis and progressive demyelination [22] . Whereas initial tissue destruction occurs as a bystander effect of the anti-viral response, paralysis and demyelination are associated with autoimmunity mediated by SR T cells activated via epitope spreading during chronic infection [18, 22] . TMEV infection thus provides a paradigm for autoimmunity associated with chronic infection and sustained inflammation. By contrast, demyelination induced by infections with the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV) or the related dual hepato-and neurotropic strain MHV-A59 suggests that persistent CNS infections, even those associated with myelin destruction, do not necessarily result in clinically apparent CNS autoimmune disease. Although a vigorous CD8 + T cell-and Th1-dominated immune anti-viral response eliminates infectious virus [23] , viral antigen and RNA persist within the CNS without evidence of active virus replication [24, 25] . Demyelination requires both infection of oligodendrocytes and adaptive immunity and is initiated by T cell-mediated virus control. Similar to chronic TMEV infection, persistent MHV infections are associated with ongoing demyelination. However, following acute viral-induced tissue injury, sustained demyelination is balanced by myelin repair, associated with clinical improvement [23, 26, 27] . The absence of disease progression during chronic MHV infection suggests that autoimmune responses are either not initiated or suppressed. Nevertheless, during acute MHV-A59 infection, sufficient myelin-derived self-antigen (Ag) is presented in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) to support proliferation of exogenously added SR T cells. However, little or no SR T cell proliferation occurred within the CNS, suggesting that T cells activated in CLN during acute infection migrate to the CNS but are unable to promote a local autoimmune response. The present study set out to determine whether Ag-presenting cells (APC) in the CNS support SR T cell proliferation and whether endogenous SR T cells are induced during JHMV-induced demyelination.",

            "text": "Infection with the MHV-A59 strain suggested that acute encephalomyelitis provides a milieu capable of supporting proliferation of transferred MOG-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells within the CLN [31] . However, neither their reactivation within the CNS, prolonged survival, or potential to induce autoimmunity have been explored. To determine whether SR CD4 + T cells are retained during chronic infection, MOGspecific 2D2 CD4 + T cells were transferred to sublethally irradiated Wt mice prior to JHMV infection. By enhancing engraftment of donor T cells, this approach increased SR T cells to numbers amenable to flow cytometric analysis, while maintaining a host anti-viral immune response. Bone marrow-derived inflammatory (CD45 hi ) cells were minimal within the CNS of recipients prior to infection (Fig. 1a) , indicating non-specific activation and that CNS recruitment was prevented by intact blood brain barrier. At day 7 p.i., maximal antiviral T cell responses [24, 25] coincided with a decreased percentage of transferred SR T cells in CLN (Fig. 1b, c) . Grafted SR T cells were undetectable within the CNS at day 7 p.i. following JHMV infection (Fig. 1b, c) in contrast to their early migration into the CNS during acute MHV-A59 infection [31] . Nevertheless, transferred SR T cells were present in the CNS of JHMV-infected mice by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 1b, c) ; furthermore, similar proliferation of grafted SR T cells and host CD4 + T cells suggested identical activation (Fig. 1d) . Although the kinetics differed, these data are consistent with CNS recruitment of SR T cells during MHV-mediated demyelination, independent of the virus strain and tropism [31] . Importantly, retention of transferred SR T cells at slightly declining frequencies within the total CNS CD4 population out to day 30 p.i. (Fig. 1b, c) negated preferential expansion/survival during chronic viral infection. The absolute numbers of grafted SR CD4 + T cells gradually declined (Fig. 1c) concomitant with contraction of the overall CD4 + T cell population, supporting a lack of ongoing self-Ag-driven survival. Furthermore, retention of SR T cells within the CNS did not alter disease severity out to 30 days p.i. (Fig. 1e) . Within the CLN, transferred SR T cells comprised~40 % of activated CD44 hi cells (data not shown) and their absolute numbers remained stable during ongoing chronic JHMV infection (Fig. 1c) . Limited proliferation of SR T cells within the CNS during acute MHV-A59 infection [31] suggested the possibility of non-specific T cell recruitment. To determine the specificity of recruitment into the CNS, heterologous OVA-specific T cells were co-transferred with SR T cells to sub-lethally irradiated mice. Prior to infection, the frequencies of both the SR-and OVA-specific T cells were similar in CLN (Fig. 1f ) and blood (data not shown), demonstrating equivalent survival. Following JHMV infection, the relative percentages of both the SR-and OVA-specific T cells were reduced in the CLN coincident with the expansion of virus-specific T cells. However, the decline in transferred SR T cells was less dramatic, suggesting enhanced survival cues via Agspecific activation (Fig. 1f ) . Consistent with an absence of non-specific peripheral activation, OVA-specific T cells were not detected in the inflamed CNS at day 14 p.i. By contrast, transferred SR T cells constituted a discrete population (Fig. 1f ) , confirming migration of peripherally activated cells and supporting Agdependent CNS retention of SR CD4 + T cells.",

Myelin, either in a soluble form or associated with APC, drains to CLN, where it can potentially activate na\u00efve SR T cells [36, 39] via presentation by CD11b + cells, comprising both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages [40] . During EAE, the most efficient population-presenting myelin antigen in the CNS is CD11b + CD11c + [41, 42] . CD11b + cells represent a small subset (between 2.5 and 4 %) of the CLN population, which only varies slightly throughout the course of JHMV infection (Fig. 2a) . Importantly, CD11c + cells constitute the vast majority of CD11b + cells (~70 %) and their frequencies within the CD11b + population remain constant between days 7 and 30 p.i. (Fig. 2a) . We therefore tested unfractionated CLNderived CD11b + cells for the presentation of self-Ag following JHMV infection. CD11b + and control CD11b \u2212 cells were purified from the CLN at different times p.i. and were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled MOG-specific CD4 + T cells as a source of SR T cells. Neither CD11b + nor CD11b \u2212 cells isolated at day 7 p.i. supported SR T cell activation (Fig. 2c) . However, by day 10 p.i., when myelin damage becomes apparent, both CD11b + and CD11b \u2212 cells initiated minimal T cell proliferation, which reached statistical significance relative to unstimulated conditions (no APC) for CD11b + cells (Fig. 2c) . Activation of SR T cells by the CD11b + population increased at days 14 and 21 p.i. concomitant with enhanced demyelination [23, 43] , while the CD11b \u2212 population retained only a minimal ability to support SR T cell proliferation (Fig. 2b, c) . The ability of CLNderived CD11b + cells to support SR T cell proliferation declined, but was sustained, by day 30 p.i., while the minimal ability of the CD11b \u2212 population dropped to below detection by 30 days p.i. (Fig. 2c) . The presence of myelin Ag within the CLN by day 14 p.i. supports the possibility that endogenous SR T cells could be activated following JHMV-induced demyelination.",

In the inflamed CNS, resident microglia and myeloid cells constitute heterogeneous populations of APC potentially capable of presenting self-Ag [40] . To determine whether CNSinfiltrating myeloid cells, comprising macrophages and dendritic cells, and/or microglia are capable of processing and presenting self-Ag within the CNS following infection, both potential APC populations were purified based on differential CD45 expression [44, 45] at distinct times p.i. and tested for the ability to support SR T cell activation in the absence of exogenously added Ag. Infiltrating myeloid cells at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 3a) were comprised of~30 % CD11c + cells, a proportion that gradually increased during the course of infection to reach~55 % at day 30 p.i. (Fig. 3a) . At the peak of acute inflammation (day 7 p.i.), neither the CD45 hi CD11b + , CD45 hi CDllb \u2212 , nor microglia populations supported T cell proliferation (Fig. 3c) . However, SR T cell proliferation was modestly increased by the CD11b + APC subset at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 3c) and prominently by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 3b, c) , similar to the CLN (Fig. 2) . On a per cell basis, the ability of infiltrating CD11b + cells to support proliferation remained relatively stable during chronic JHMV infection (Fig. 3c) . Although CD11b \u2212 cells appeared to promote minimal proliferation, their activity remained near threshold levels throughout the infection. Similar to the CD11b \u2212 population, microglia were unable to support SR T cell proliferation at any time p.i. (Fig. 3b, c) . The kinetics of SR CD4 + T cell activation by CNS-infiltrating CD11b + cells correlate with viralinduced myelin destruction as a source of self-Ag [43] . In addition, anti-MHC class II Ab blocked proliferation, supporting MHC class II-dependent T cell activation (Fig. 3d) rather than non-specific proliferation signals derived from the inflamed CNS environment (Fig. 1d) .",

Under these conditions, microglia induced proliferation of SR CD4 + T cells as well as infiltrating CD11b + cells (Fig. 4c) . These data demonstrate that while class II levels on microglia suffice to present The inability of microglia to support SR T cell proliferation may reflect a defect in myelin uptake or Ag processing. Myelin engulfment by Iba1 + cells supports myelin uptake by microglia and/or infiltrating myeloid cells during JHMV-induced demyelination (Fig. 5a) . However, the amoeboid morphology of microglia during inflammation prevents histological distinction between myelin in macrophages versus microglia (Fig. 5a) . Mice expressing GFP under the PLP promoter were therefore infected to quantify GFP as a surrogate marker for myelin ingestion by infiltrating CD11b + cells versus microglia. Flow cytometry revealed GFP within both infiltrating myeloid cells (CD45 hi CD11b + ) and microglia (CD45 low CD11b + ) (Fig. 5b, c) . Percentages of infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia containing GFP were relatively stable between days 7 and 30 p.i. (Fig. 5b) , with a higher proportion of microglia containing GFP, supporting their primary role in demyelination [46] . In contrast to percentages, MFI analysis showed that the amount of GFP differed throughout the course of infection (Fig. 5c) . Infiltrating CD11b + cells exhibited peak uptake at 14 days p.i., which slowly decreased at later time points (Fig. 5c) , but remained higher than GFP MFI in the control CD45 hi CD11b \u2212 population, as well as CD45 hi CD11b + cells isolated from na\u00efve animals (Fig. 5c) . By contrast, a gradual increase in GFP was observed within microglia throughout the course of JHMV infection independent of auto-fluorescence (Fig. 5c) . These data imply that both the infiltrating myeloid and microglial populations phagocytoze myelin during viral-induced demyelination. Therefore, the inability of microglia to support SR T cell activation is less likely to reside in Fig. 5 Myelin debris within CNS cells. a PLP (red) and Iba1 (green) stainings on spinal cord tissue isolated from Wt-infected mice at day 21 p.i. and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Plausible explanations may be that SR T cells are either not, or only minimally, induced or that they are not reactivated within the CNS. Indeed, demyelination triggered by oligodendrocyte death fails to initiate autoimmunity, despite myelin Ag drainage to CLN [38] . To determine if JHMV-induced demyelination results in the activation of endogenous SR T cells, CD4 + T cell responses to the H-2 b restricted encephalitogenic myelin epitopes MOG and MBP were assessed by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) to detect lowfrequency responder cells. Responses to the H-2 b -restricted immuno-dominant viral M 133 epitope [47] were used as positive controls. Analysis focused on IFN-\u03b3producing CD4 + T cells, as JHMV infection induces a vigorous Th1 response with negligible IL-17 or IL-9 components (data not shown), which is supported by no affects on pathogenesis in the absence of IL-23 [48] . Virus-as well as myelin-specific T cell frequencies were lower than 9 and 5 positive cells per 10 6 , respectively, within the CLN and spleen of na\u00efve animals (Fig. 6a) . Within CLN, the frequency of virus-specific CD4 + T cells peaked at day 7 p.i., declined by day 14 p.i., and remained relatively stable up to day 60 p.i. (Fig. 6a) . Within the CNS, frequencies of virus-specific T cells were~10 higher than CLN at day 7 p.i., continued to increase at day 14 p.i., and declined as the overall inflammatory response resolved due to virus control (Fig. 6a) .",

Maximum SR T cell frequencies were observed at day 30 p.i. (Fig. 6a) with responses near detection limits in a large proportion of infected mice throughout infection (Fig. 6b) . A very limited number of infected mice harbored SR T cells within the CNS during acute infection at days 7 and 14 p.i. However, by day 21 p.i., the number of responder mice exhibiting SR T cells within the CNS reached 100 % (Fig. 6b) , coincident with peak frequencies of both MOG-and MBP-specific T cells between days 21 and 30 p.i.

Although the SR T cell frequencies in the CNS were variable among individual mice, and always reduced relative to virus-specific T cells, they were increased relative to the CLN at day 21 p.i. and thereafter (Fig. 6a) . Importantly, CNS SR T cells were sustained above baseline during resolution of clinical symptoms, with preferential stability of MOG-specific T cells (Fig. 6a, b) . However, compared to peak SR T cell frequencies at days 21/30 p.i., frequencies, as well as the number of mice harboring CNS SR T cells, declined as clinical disease resolved (Fig. 6c) . These data demonstrate that endogenous SR T cells are induced in the vast majority of JHMV-infected mice. However, they are only sustained within the CNS of~60 % of mice during chronic demyelination, when lesion formation is counterbalanced by repair (Fig. 6a, b) . Importantly, segregation of mice harboring SR T cells within the CNS after day 30 versus mice in which SR T cells were undetectable showed no differences in overall clinical recovery (Fig. 6d) . These data further supported our previous observations that CNS recruitment and retention of SR T cells did not alter disease severity (Fig. 1e) .",

            "text": "Animal models have demonstrated that viral infections can promote the initiation as well as increase the severity of autoimmune diseases [4] . However, evidence for a viral etiology of human autoimmune diseases, including MS, remains elusive. Moreover, given the extent of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae, it has also been proposed that infections may even provide protection from autoimmunity. Specifically, the conditions promoting or stemming activation of auto-Ag-specific T cells following viralinduced tissue damage have not been extensively explored. Chronic CNS infection by the naturally occurring mouse pathogen TMEV promotes activation of SR T cells, which mediates increasing tissue destruction accompanied by an ascending paralysis [20] . By contrast, infection with JHMV also leads to immune-mediated demyelination; however, persistent infection correlates with clinical recovery [27] . While clinical improvement throughout persistence despite ongoing demyelination supported the absence of an autoimmune component following neurotropic MHV infection, previous studies clearly demonstrate sufficient auto-Ag presentation to induce SR T cell responses [31, 49, 50] . In an effort to reconcile peripheral activation of SR T cells, but no disease exacerbation, this study set out to assess kinetics of auto-Ag presentation as well as the fate of SR T cells following JHMV infection. The data demonstrate the presence of APC capable of activating SR T cells in both the CLN and the CNS with maximal stimulating activity during the time of most overt demyelination. While both the CNS-infiltrating myeloid population and microglia ingest GFP as a surrogate for myelin, only the CNSinfiltrating APC were capable of presenting endogenous , and MBP 60-80 detected in na\u00efve animals. Red bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. Significant differences between time points are indicated *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. Significant differences compared to baseline levels are indicated #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 using unpaired t test. b Percentage of mice exhibiting IFN-\u03b3-secreting MOG and MBP-specific CD4 + T cells above maximal baseline levels in the CLN and CNS between days 7 and 60 p.i. c Clinical symptoms following JHMV infection.

Finally, the results demonstrate that SR T cells are activated from the endogenous T cell repertoire when myelin destruction is evident, but infectious virus is already controlled. Although SR T cells migrate into and are most prominent in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination, no evidence was found to suggest preferential expansion despite ongoing demyelination, consistent with minimal re-stimulation in vivo.",

            "text": "Mechanisms underlying SR T cell activation following CNS infections include molecular mimicry between pathogen and self-epitopes, presentation of self-peptides from tissue damage, and dysregulation of regulatory tolerance mechanisms [51, 52] . Myelin-specific T cells isolated from MS patients have been shown to cross-react with human coronavirus [53, 54] . Similarly, homology was found between MHV and myelin peptides, potentially triggering autoimmune disease [55] . Nevertheless, SR T cells were near detection levels within the CNS during acute JHMV infection in the vast majority of mice and their frequency only increased as myelin damage increased. Moreover, their numbers declined as clinical symptoms dropped due to increased repair. Self-Ag-specific activation of SR T cells is further supported by the lack of T cell activation with irrelevant specificity and blockade of activation by anti class II Ab, ruling out bystander events. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that release of myelin debris due to JHMV-induced tissue damage results in cell-free or cell-associated myelin drainage to CLN, where a population of CD11b + APC can support the activation of SR T cells. Activated SR T cells access the CNS at a time when the vast majority of infectious virus is already controlled, but persistence drives ongoing expression of proinflammatory molecules capable of recruiting activated cells from circulation [56] . Local encounter with myelin-loaded CD45 hi CD11b + APC, but not microglia, is then poised to drive SR T cell reactivation. The apparent inability of microglia to activate SR CD4 + T cells ex vivo remains unclear as their uptake of myelin is consistent with demyelination independent of inflammatory monocyte recruitment following JHMV infection [46] . Nevertheless, microglia also failed to support CD4 + T cell responses following TMEV infection and induction of EAE [57, 58] . In fact, several studies question the role of microglia as APC in vivo [59] despite their implication as APC based on expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules in both MS patients [60] and EAE [61] , as well as their ability to activate CD4 + T cells in vitro [57] . Detection of myelin within Iba1 + cells increased GFP MFI in microglia, as well as detection of myelin in microglia in other models [57, 58] supports self-Ag uptake during JHMV infection. However, these data suggest that microglia may be poor at processing myelin Ag for loading onto MHC class II. This notion is also supported by effective priming of SR T cells using exogenous peptide, despite reduced MHC class II expression relative to infiltrating CD11b + cells. In addition, as activated microglia can adapt to their surroundings to mediate both pro-and anti-inflammatory functions [62] , it cannot be excluded that microglia may negatively regulate SR T cell responses during chronic JHMV infection by limiting T cell proliferation or by inducing apoptosis [63] .",

            "text": "The results also indicate a discrepancy between APC presentation capacity ex vivo, yet apparently limited SR T cell activation in vivo. Although APC in CLN sustain their ability to activate SR T cells throughout days 14 to 30 p.i., endogenous SR T cells are only detected at low frequencies and exhibit a brief peak at day 30 p.i. Maximal accumulation of SR T cells in the CNS between days 21 and 30 p.i. in all mice supports efficient egress from CLN. Whether frequencies in the CNS are supported by ongoing recruitment or local expansion remains unclear. The capacity of CNS-infiltrating CD11b + cells to activate SR T cells ex vivo in the absence of exogenous peptide indicates that APC are competent to reactivate SR T cells throughout chronic infection. However, no evidence for preferential expansion or retention of SR T within the CNS relative to virus-specific CD4 + T cells suggests that the absence of sustained activation may contribute to the lack of increasing clinical symptoms during chronic infection. These results clearly differ from the TMEV model, in which SR T cells aggravate pathology and clinical disease. One possible scenario is that persistent JHMV infection may establish an environment that suppresses the SR T cell response. JHMV infection induces both Agspecific and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells [64, 65] which are efficient at controlling autoimmunity in other settings [66, 67] . Treg depletion [65] , elimination of Agspecific Treg [65] , and adoptive transfer of Foxp3 + Treg [68] during acute JHMV infection all demonstrated that, in contrast to TMEV [69] , Tregs have a limited effect on virus clearance. Nevertheless, Foxp3 + Tregs play a critical role in limiting tissue destruction [68] , suggesting that they regulate the activation or effector function of SR T cells following JHMVinduced demyelination [70] . Although Treg control of SR T cells in vivo and their association with increased tissue destruction remains unknown, depletion of Treg correlates with increased proliferation of SR T cells in the CLN during acute MHV-A59 infection [31] . Whether Tregs act in limiting SR T cell induction during JHMV infection, which does not or only poorly replicates in CLN, or whether additional factors limit SR T cell responses at the target site remains to be elucidated.",
