This is important since the production cost increases more than linearly with chain length. Also the size of the nanoparticles is significantly smaller than 20 nm, thus reducing the immunogenicity of the particles, which in turn may allow to use the SAPNs as drug delivery systems without the risk of an anaphylactic shock.",

They often perform sophisticated cellular functions. Such nanoparticles have a central cavity that can be exploited as a simple encapsulation system for the transport and controlled release and delivery of drugs and genes to targeted cells [4] [5] [6] . They can also be used in protein separation, enzyme immobilization, and in blood cell substitution [7, 8] . Virus-like particles have long been used as vaccine platforms for infectious diseases but they could potentially also be used as therapeutic vaccines to treat addiction and other diseases such as cancer [9, 10] . In our group we are designing self-assembling peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) as vaccines for infectious diseases like malaria [11] , HIV [12] or influenza [13] , but they can be used for many other diseases [14] .",

One helix is forming a pentameric coiled coil while the other is forming a trimeric coiled coil (Fig. 1a, b) . Coiled coils are an ubiquitous protein folding and oligomerization motif that exhibits abundance in sequence and function [15] . For instance, coiled coils like bZIP transcription factors contain a DNA-binding sequence whereas other coiled coils like intermediate filaments and spectrin can be structural components of the cell [16] . Furthermore, coiled coils can have dynamic functions such as myosin and dyneins, which act as \"movement\" proteins [16] . The majority of \u03b1-helical coiled coils are based on a heptad sequence repeat, composed of seven amino acids usually denoted abcdefg [17] . From two to seven strands of \u03b1-helices wrap around each other to create a superhelical twist that is normally left-handed [15] . The driving force for the interaction between these \u03b1-helices are the hydrophobic amino acids located in positions a and d of the heptad repeat. Ionic interactions between residues, for example in position e and g of the heptad repeat (i to i + 5) in parallel dimers and trimers, also further stabilize coiled-coil interfaces.",

The angle between the pentameric and trimeric helices, the overall charge, the charge distribution along the peptide chain, and the different non-covalent interactions within the peptide nanoparticle, along with the solvent condition, are the key parameters that govern the quality of the nanoparticle formed in solution. Figure 3 represents different mutations of the parent sequence of the model peptide that we have studied by molecular dynamics simulation. Mutations have been introduced close to the glycine residue of the linker region of all the constructs. A disulfide bond has been introduced by double mutations T15C and S23C in peptide 3, peptide 6, and peptide 8 to see how this constraint affects the peptide conformation. A single mutation S23T on the trimeric side has been introduced in peptide 2, peptide 5, and peptide 7 to see how this bulkier residue (threonine versus serine) can affect the overall conformation of these peptides. Another single mutation S23N on the trimeric side has been tested in peptide 4. Additional mutations have been introduced a little farther away from the linker region to modify the long range electrostatic interactions between the oligomerization domains along the fivefold and threefold axes of the icosahedron. Figure 5a represents the 3D models of all the initial peptides 1 to 11 with the mutant residues in red color. The overall charge in both the pentameric and trimeric domains along with the overall charge of the construct are depicted in Fig. 3 .",

An asymmetric unit can be built by cutting the whole system along the four planes passing through the rotational axes fivefold and twofold, twofold and threefold, threefold and twofold, and twofold and fivefold (Fig. 6a) .

            "text": "Here, we have calculated the RGYR in 100 mM salt environment, which are plotted in Fig. 7b . Panels a and b show two clusters of molecules in the salt environment, one with a diverging tendency (peptides 1, 3, and 4) and the other eight constructs (peptides 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) with a converging tendency. Eight converging peptides show the variation of RMSD within 7 \u00c5 with respect to the energy minimized structure, whereas the variation of RMSD for the three diverging structures is about 10 \u00c5. Again, Fig. 7b shows that the RGYR are pretty stable with simulation time, and the value (16.2 \u00c5) for the converging cluster is lower than that of the diverging cluster (18 \u00c5). MD simulations have also been run in water environment (data not shown) showing a tendency of divergence indicating unstable conformation even after 2 ns. Thus, adding salt has an important role in folding and converging to a stable nanoparticle. Figure 7c shows the superposition of 3 diverging constructs (peptides 1, 3, and 4) after 2 ns of MD simulation. Peptides 1 and 3 show deformation at the linker region, while peptide 4 shows deformation at the N-terminus of the pentameric helix. In both models, where the linker region contains either a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues (peptide 3) or a hydrogen bond between threonine and asparagine (peptide 4), a deformation of the helices can be observed. Similarly, an unbalanced situation in the start model (peptide 1) results in a structural deformation as well (Fig. 7c) . The upper clusters in Fig. 7a , b that shows the divergence behavior of three model peptides (peptides 1, 3, and 4) during 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation in presence of 100 mM NaCl, were discarded for further analysis. Figure 7d shows the superposition of the remaining eight constructs (peptides 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11), which are converging during 2 ns MD simulation in presence of 100 mM NaCl as shown in the lower clusters of the Fig. 7a , b. Additional file 3: Figure S3 shows the effect of additional mutation on peptide 2, while Additional file 4: Figure S4 shows the effect of an additional mutation on peptide 3. In the model of peptide 2 (with an overall charge of \u22122), where the serine residue in the trimeric domain was replaced by threonine (S23T), no deformation of the helices was observed during a 2 ns MD simulation. Rather, it converged into a stable helical conformation. Although peptide 2 converged to a reasonably good structure at the end of MD simulation, when supplemented with an additional mutation (E7A or R30E) (peptides 5 and 7), it showed some degree of deformation in the 3D structure and also a deviation in rmsd and radii of gyration (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ). Specifically, in peptide 7, where the mutation R30E causes a loss of salt bridge interaction between E7 and R30 in peptide 2, a deformation developed at the N-terminus of the pentameric helix (Additional file 3: Figure S3d ). Although peptide 2 and peptide 5 did not show much structural deformation during 2 ns MD simulation, the angles between the pentamer and trimer helices are 49.9\u00b0 and 45.7\u00b0 respectively, which deviate by 12.5\u00b0 and 8.3\u00b0 from the angle (37.4\u00b0) between the corresponding fivefold and threefold axes in an icosahedron (Fig. 4a) . The angle between the two helices in peptide 7 is 34.3\u00b0, which is 3.1\u00b0 smaller than the value in the icosahedron. Final models of peptides 9 and 10 after 2 ns MD simulation are shown in Fig. 5 . Alanine substitution in place of Glu7 causes a deformation at the N-terminus of the pentameric helix in peptide 9. However, the reduced electrostatic interaction caused by the R30E mutation in the trimeric helix of peptide 10 results in maintaining the overall conformation with a slight bending at the C-terminus of this helix (Fig. 5b) . The double mutation E7R/E27D introduced in peptide 11 (Fig. 5b) causes a deformation in the trimeric helix while maintaining the helical conformation of the pentameric domain. The mutation E7R on the pentameric domain probably repels R30 on the trimeric side, thereby initiating both intra-and inter-domain salt bridge interactions R30 to D27 and R7 to E34 respectively that lead to a distinct conformational change at the C-terminus of the trimeric helix in peptide 11.",

Here, in peptides 6 and 8 these inter-helical angles are 42.5\u00b0 and 38.8\u00b0. While, the minimum value 37.4\u00b0 corresponds to the perfect alignment of pentameric and trimeric helices along the fivefold and threefold axes of the icosahedron respectively, the coiled coil add additional twisting to those helical axes.

Just before the stop codon an arginine residue was introduced so as to further stabilize the short trimeric coiled coil.

How short can you make the pentamer and trimer and still get nanoparticle assembly? To assess the feasibility of future lab work on such minimized peptides, we have performed molecular dynamics studies. Our observation on peptide-based mininanoparticles based on molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the dependencies of point mutations close to and nearby the linker region on the assembly of simulated nanoparticles. Flexibility in the linker region induced by a G19 can be controlled by the design and optimization of a single/double mutation near the linker region. We also studied the effect on the nanoparticle assembly of some point mutations further away from the linker region. A molecular dynamics simulation of 11 designed constructs showed the variation of convergence into helical conformation of the two oligomerization domains as well as that of the inter-helical angle. Peptide 8 folded into the bestassembled nanoparticle after 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation. In this construct we incorporated a disulfide bond by double mutations T15C and S23C together with a third point mutation A30E in the trimeric domain. Although the disulfide bond alone (peptide 3) distorted the peptide conformation, when the additional mutation This computational study on peptide mini-SAPNs could potentially benefit the nanotechnology of therapeutic development, especially in vaccine design, drug delivery, and bio-imaging. If you could get a so-called \"mini nanoparticle\" chemical peptide syntheses might be useful to manufacture the peptide instead of relying on recombinant production with E. coli. For vaccine research chemical syntheses of peptide nanoparticles would be advantageous, as traditional contaminants inherent to protein purification such as LPS and proteases would be eliminated. This in turn would allow the peptide nanoparticle to be on \"fast-track\" to Phase I clinical trials and major hurdles with the FDA could be avoided. For example Audran et al. have led a synthetic peptide derived from a Malaria antigen into a phase I Malaria vaccine trial [23] .",

Flexibility in the linker region induced by glycine residues is needed to allow for the helix-turn-helix motif, but on the other hand the protein chain can be stabilized in this conformation by the choice of optimal neighboring residues. We studied the effect of point mutations within and somewhat more distant from the linker region on the nanoparticle assembly.

In conclusion, the particular amino acid sequences of the linker region has a significant effect on the assembly properties of the SAPNs. Combining mutations within the linker itself with mutations more distant from the linker can provide a powerful way to design and optimize its peptide sequence.

The peptide molecule was solvated and ions were added to achieve a particular salt concentration. In the energy minimization step, we used the steepest descent (SD) method for 50 steps followed by the adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) method for 50,000 steps, where each step is 1 fs. After the energy minimization of the whole system, the temperature was raised slowly to 300 K from an initial temperature of 100 K at a rate of 10\u00b0/1000 steps to relax the molecule and then to run the equilibration for a total time of 100 ps, including the time to raise the temperature. Production dynamics for 2 ns were run thereafter on the whole system for initial screening. Long 10 ns production dynamics were also performed on selected models to find the best one. To analyze the final models, we have calculated root mean square deviation (RMSD) and radius of gyration (RGYR) with respect to the energy minimized structure using CHARMM algorithm [28] .",
