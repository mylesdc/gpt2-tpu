As compared to mice, humans are naturally exposed to their own pathogens, often through recurrent infections, and are therefore a better source of antibodies that target the most relevant antigens and can reveal mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. Furthermore, given the genetic variability of the human population and the idiosyncrasies of the immune response, some individuals may generate antibodies with unusual potency or breadth. Finally, studies of the antibody response in humans can shed light on basic aspects of the immune response, such as the role of somatic mutations and the mechanisms that underpin the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies or autoantibodies, and possibly uncover examples of such mechanisms that may be uniquely developed or better identified in humans.",

            "text": "In the last decade, several methods have been developed to isolate human monoclonal antibodies. In principle, they come down to two basic approaches. The first approach consists of the isolation of single antigen-specific B cells using a fluorescently tagged antigen as a bait, followed by cloning of immunoglobulin genes and expression of the recombinant antibodies in a cell line. This method is very effective, but requires that the target antigen is known and available in a purified form. In my laboratory, we developed an alternative approach based on high-throughput screening of the antibodies produced by cultured B cells or plasma cells (Fig 1A) . Memory B cells from selected donors are immortalized with high efficiency (>30%) by combining Epstein-Barr virus (that delivers signal 1 and signal 2) with a TLR7 or TLR9 agonist (that delivers signal 3 required for potent activation of memory B cells) (Traggiai et al, 2004) . The immortalized B cells proliferate and secrete large amounts of antibodies in the culture supernatant. Antigen-specific plasma cells recovered following a booster immunization have lost proliferative capacity, but can be kept alive in cultures supplemented with IL-6 and stromal cells. In these cultures that mimic the survival niches of the bone marrow, a single plasma cell secretes antibodies at a constant rate of 100 pg/day (Corti et al, 2011) . To facilitate the isolation of specific antibodies and the cloning of the VH/VL genes, both immortalized B cells and plasma cells are seeded in clonal conditions and cultures are handled with an automated liquid handling system. There are distinctive advantages in screening the repertoire of secreted antibodies. The first is that the approach is target-agnostic, since screening can be done using functional assays, such as virus neutralization, without a priori knowledge of the target antigens, using even whole bacteria or parasites. Second, it is well suited to identify antibodies that cross-react with different antigens, since parallel screenings can be performed against multiple targets. Third, it bypasses the need to sequence and express large numbers of antibody sequences since cells of interest are selected based on the initial screenings.",

By screening for the capacity to neutralize the wild-type virus, we isolated antibodies that were 1,000-fold more potent than antibodies to the fusion protein gB and identified their viral target as a pentameric complex formed by gH, gL, pUL128, pUL130 and pUL131A. We then produced a soluble form of this pentamer and found that it can elicit, in mice, neutralizing antibody titres that exceeded by more than 100-fold those induced in humans by natural infection (Kabanova et al, 2014) . These studies illustrate a general approach of \"analytic vaccinology\" where the neutralizing antibodies are used for the identification of the target antigen and for the quality control of the recombinant vaccine.",

These include the antibodies FI6 and FY1, which bind to conserved epitopes in the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neutralize all influenza A viruses (Corti et al, 2011; Kallewaard et al, 2016) , and MPE8, an antibody that binds to a unique conserved site on the pre-fusion form of the F protein and neutralizes four different paramyxoviruses, including human RSV and MPV (Corti et al, 2013) . These antibodies are promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections since they trigger effector functions and target conserved structures, thus limiting the possibility of selecting escape mutants. In addition, they represent useful tools for the design of stabilized pre-fusion glycoprotein vaccines. A straightforward application of the method lies in the rapid isolation of neutralizing antibodies against emerging pathogens, such as Ebola virus, SARS (Traggiai et al, 2004) and MERS coronaviruses. In the case of MERS, it was possible, in only 4 months, to go from a sample of memory B cells to preclinical validation of a neutralizing antibody and the generation of a cell line producing the antibody in grams/L amounts. Similar studies on Dengue and Zika viruses defined different classes of antibodies endowed with neutralizing or infection-enhancing activity.",

            "text": "The interrogation of the memory B-cell repertoire offers the opportunity to investigate, in biologically and medically relevant settings, fundamental aspects of the human immune response, such as the relative contribution of germ line V-gene polymorphism, VDJ junctional diversity and somatic mutations to antigenic specificity. An interesting example comes from the study of antibodies that neutralize group 1 influenza viruses and that are produced by most individuals following infection or vaccination. As reported by several laboratories, these \"public\" antibodies use VH1-69 and bind, exclusively through the VH, to a conserved region in the HA stem. By isolating a large number of sister clones and by performing a genealogical analysis of different clonal families, we found that the unmutated common ancestors (UCA) have low affinity for group 1 HA and do not neutralize infection (Fig 1B and C) . Remarkably, the first branch points acquire through a single P52aA mutation in HCDR2, high affinity and neutralizing activity, comparable to that of the antibodies isolated from memory B cells that carried up to 15-30 amino acid substitution (Pappas et al, 2014) . These findings demonstrate that affinity maturation can be achieved rapidly, through a single mutation, and that numerous and redundant somatic mutations continue to accumulate, providing an extensive diversification within the proliferating clone. Interestingly, in these antibodies, a critical contact residue, F54, is germline-encoded, but this position is dimorphic, with different alleles carrying either F or L. Consequently, individuals who lack a F54-encoding allele cannot produce the public VH1-69 antibody response, while individuals that have a F54 allele have a high frequency of precursors, with the only additional requirement being a 13-amino acid HCDR3 with a Y98 that makes a critical contact site with the antigen. These findings underline the impact that VH-gene polymorphism can have on the antibody response and suggest that certain alleles may play the role of immune response (Ir) genes and become positively selected in the population exposed to a given pathogen.",

These findings are consistent with a model where pan-influenza neutralizing antibodies arise from the priming of high-affinity precursors by a group 1 virus (in this case H1N1), followed by somatic mutations and generation of a variant with broader reactivity to group 2 viruses that can be boosted by a group 2 virus such as H3N2 (Fig 1D) . Importantly, the isolation of cells producing the identical FI6 antibody for 4 consecutive years in response to vaccination or infection indicates that secondary antibody responses are to a large extent independent from germinal centres, a factor that allows the antibody to retain the original specificity. The genealogical analysis of the neutralizing antibody MPE8 revealed a similar mechanism, with the UCA possessing high affinity for RSV only and MPE8 acquiring cross-reactivity to MPV through somatic mutations (Corti et al, 2013) .",

Somatic mutations in LAIR1 were more frequent when the insertion was at the V-DJ junction, which is continually targeted by AID in germinal centres, and less frequent when the insertion was in the switch region, which is only transiently targeted by AID during switch recombination. Interestingly, somatic mutations in the LAIR1 domain eliminate collagen binding and modulate affinity and cross-reactivity with different RIFINs. The finding that collagen binding was always lost, even when the somatic mutation mechanism was less effective, suggests that loss of self-reactivity is a prerequisite for expansion of B cells making LAIR1-containing antibodies.",

In an initial attempt to determine the generality of this phenomenon, we found frequent insertions in the switch region of memory B cells from European blood donors. Interestingly, the inserts largely originate from genes that are transcribed in B cells and are encoded in virtually all chromosomes and, in rare cases, comprised exons with frames compatible with expression ( Fig 2D) .",

However, the finding of frequent templated insertions in European blood donors is more consistent with a general mechanism that remains to be molecularly defined. The sites of insertion suggest a mechanism of patch-repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by either RAG or AID during V-DJ recombination or class switch. The integrity of the genomic LAIR1 loci in B-cell clones producing LAIR1containing antibodies suggests a copy-andpaste mechanism. In view of the finding that the inserts contain intronic sequences and are derived from expressed genes, we favour the hypothesis that the templated DNA may originate from the resolution of stalled replication forks caused by a clash between transcription and DNA replication.",

            "text": "Our findings suggest that the insertion of templated DNA represents a novel and general mechanism of antibody diversification that can provide a broad range of protein domains to be further diversified by somatic mutations. As exemplified by LAIR1, the insertion of a domain encoding a pathogen receptor can generate public antibodies that are effective against the pathogen. Distinctive advantages of these receptor-based antibodies lie in the broad recognition of all pathogen variants, leaving no room for the selection of escape mutants, and in the possibility of diversifying the receptor domain through somatic mutations to increase binding to pathogen and decrease self-reactivity. The new antibodies are reminiscent of Ehrlich's \"side-chain\" theory of antibody production, where the antibody was essentially a secreted form of the receptor for the pathogen. We predict that other examples of receptor-based antibodies will be found in response to a variety of human pathogens. Besides LAIR1, other candidates for the generation of receptor-based antibodies to P. falciparum are ICAM1, an adhesion molecule that binds to IEs, and LILRB1, an inhibitory receptor that, like LAIR1, has been shown to bind to RIFINs. Similarly, insertions of ICAM1 or SLAM domains may generate receptor-based antibodies that neutralize rhinoviruses or measles virus. As a final remark, we realize that, by uncovering the ingenuity of Nature, we have learned new ways to engineer antibodies and, possibly, to edit antibodies in primary B cells using the endogenous AID activity. We also discovered how strong antibody responses can be generated by a single B-cell clone, raising a case for adoptive B-cell therapy.",

(C) Public antibodies that neutralize group 1 influenza viruses use VH1-69 alleles with F54 and have a 13-amino acid HCDR3 with Y98 (black lines). They can achieve high affinity through a single P52aA mutation (red). Shown are the functional properties of the UCA, of the first branch point (BP) and of a mature antibody (FI225) carrying several redundant mutations. (D) Schematic view of the developmental pathway of paninfluenza neutralizing antibodies. A high-affinity precursor specific for group 1 viruses (H1N1) generates, through somatic mutations, a variant that is expanded by stimulation with a group 2 virus (H3N2) in the absence of further mutations.",
