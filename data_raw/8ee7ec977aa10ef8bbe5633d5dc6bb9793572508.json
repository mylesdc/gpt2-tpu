Ester S1 (330 mg, 0.90 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of MeOH and 10 ml of water, LiOH (86 mg, 3.60 mmol, 4.00 equiv) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 50\u00b0C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and 100 ml of water was added; it was then extracted twice with AcOEt. The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 3 with concentrated HCl 36%, then extracted twice with AcOEt. The combined organic phase was dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated to yield S2 (283 mg, 93%) as a white solid. 1 ",
