GLDC was identified as a possible susceptibility factor for severe H1N1 infection in a GWAS analyzing 174 severe patients and 258 mildly infected controls. This was further validated in an H7N9-infected patient cohort. The identified GLDC risk allele, rs1755609-A, correlates with increased GLDC expression when analyzing genotype/expression data from several previous studies. Mechanistically, the authors present loss of function and gain of function experiments showing that GLDC regulates the type I IFN response and replication of influenza virus in human cells. Finally, they observe that GLDC chemical inhibition in mice increases survival after H1N1 infection, correlating with decreased lung viral load and an increased IFN response. Overall, the data provided is convincing and supports the conclusion that GLDC represents a novel influenza virus susceptibility gene in cells and in vivo.",

Knock down of GLDC expression combined with polyI,C transfection had a similar effect. Treatment of A549 cells with AOAA reduced the replication of H1N1pdm and H7N9 infection, and was associated with increased type I IFN induction. Knock down of GLDC expression reduced H7N9 replication and overexpression of GLDC increased H7N9 replication in A549 cells. Finally, three consecutive intranasal AOAA treatments of mice partially protected the mice against disease following H1N1pdm challenge, which was associated with reduced virus replication and increased IFNalpha and ISG expression.",

Several susceptibility gene polymorphisms have been proposed to contribute to disease severity in influenza patients in the context of H1N1pdm or zoonotic infections with H7N9 viruses (IFITM3; Chen et al Sci Rep. 2016 May 9; 6:25614. doi: 10.1038/srep25614.) . The authors previously proposed that Galectin 1 was a susceptibility gene for H7N9. Now altered expression of GLDC is proposed as a susceptibility gene, mechanistically supposedly by its impact on pyrimidine biosynthesis, which in turn can suppress the innate antiviral response. There may thus be a more general effect on susceptibility to virus infection and GLDC expression or activation levels. The proposed link between GLCD and innate antiviral responses would be strengthened if the authors could extend the findings for another viral infection, for example VSV.",

They begin this study by identifying GLDC using a genome-wide association study in patient populations that presented with severe infections caused by either H7N9 or pandemic H1N1 viruses. Genetic evaluation of these patients showed an association between severe a GLDC SNP and severe influenza infections. The authors then tested the contribution of GLDC to severe influenza infection by initially testing the response of influenza virus-infected cells to treatment with the GLDC inhibitor (aminooxy)acetic acid (AOAA) in A549 cells. Specifically, using a luciferase system, the authors show that type I IFN expression is increased in the presence of the GLDC inhibitor AOAA, indicating that GLDC limits anti-viral activity. These findings are corroborated using siRNA studies that show increased type I IFN expression when GLDC is depleted.",

Interestingly, the increase in ISGs is both more robust and broad after infection with H7N9 when compared with H1N1, indicating potential viral gene contributions to the phenotypes observed. The authors then use both siRNA depletion of GLDC and GLDC overexpression to show that GLDC expression directly affects virus replication, type I IFN expression, and ISG levels after infection. Finally, in a mouse infection model the authors show that AOAA is as effective as zanamivir at preventing death after influenza virus infection, an outcome that is associated with increased virus levels in lungs, IFN-alpha expression, ISG expression, and detection of virus nucleoprotein in the lung.",

One major concern with the data presented is the eventual utilization of a therapeutic that targets a gene product that needs to be inhibited in order to demonstrate an effect. Treatment of individuals with this product will need to overcome variations in gene expression within the human population that my greatly influence dosing and overall effectiveness. The most direct demonstration of effectiveness in a therapeutic setting is the murine study where AOAA is used to prevent death after infection, but the initial infection is still associated with weight loss and recovery. Furthermore, the fact that AOAA is administered on days -1, 0, and +1 after infection brings into question the potential application of this therapeutic. How do the authors propose therapeutic treatment after influenza virus infection? 2. In the animal model, would the authors please explain the criteria for evaluating illness and death after infection that is presented in Figure 4B and EV4.

Would AOAA therapy be expected to affect progression to a secondary bacterial infection? Would this effect be prevention or enhancement of this secondary infection? 4. The genetic observation made does not seem to associate disease severity with a loss of gene expression, a tool that was used to demonstrate the role of GLDC in the cell culture studies. In the individuals that have different SNPs for GLDC, are the levels of protein expression affected? What are the subsequent type I IFN responses in these individuals? Since these are type I IFNs, their baseline levels may be increased when compared to individuals with high levels of GLDC expression. Similarly, does ISG expression differ in these individuals? Finally, can AOAA be used clinically, and does it have any potential alternative effects that could be detrimental to the progression of a virus infection and/or a secondary bacterial infection? 5. Overall, the decrease in virus titers in the lungs of mice ( Figure 4C ) was approximately 1-2 logs with high levels still detected at Day 5 post-infection.

While understandable at the level of data presentation and evaluation, the manuscript would benefit from substantial editing for sentence and paragraph structure throughout. Evidence presented in this study indicates that high expression of GLDC, a pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme, increases human susceptibility to severe influenza virus infections via regulation of type I interferon induction. GLDC was identified as a possible susceptibility factor for severe H1N1 infection in a GWAS analyzing 174 severe patients and 258 mildly infected controls. This was further validated in an H7N9-infected patient cohort. The identified GLDC risk allele, rs1755609-A, correlates with increased GLDC expression when analyzing genotype/expression data from several previous studies. Mechanistically, the authors present loss of function and gain of function experiments showing that GLDC regulates the type I IFN response and replication of influenza virus in human cells. Finally, they observe that GLDC chemical inhibition in mice increases survival after H1N1 infection, correlating with decreased lung viral load and an increased IFN response. Overall, the data provided is convincing and supports the conclusion that GLDC represents a novel influenza virus susceptibility gene in cells and in vivo.",

The two study cohorts were applied to array genome-wide SNP analysis using different chips. The H1N1 association SNP rs1755609, also an expression quantitative locus of GLDC gene, was not incorporated in the chip used for genotyping H7N9 cohort samples. Thus, there is no rs1755609 genotyping data in H7N9 cohort. Based on linkage disequilibrium data of human genome, we selected a high linkage variant with rs1755609, i.e., SNP rs243840, and tested it in the H7N9 cohort. As shown in Table 2 , rs2438409 variants are significant association with the susceptibility to H7N9 infection. In Fig 1C, the numbers inside the boxes are r 2 measure. The grey box without number indicates the highest r 2 of 1.0. Figure 1C shows that r 2 measure in Chinese, Japanese and Caucasian are 0. Unlike common diseases such as cancer or hypertension, severe influenza is relatively less prevalent. As far as we know, few GWAS has been performed to identify susceptibility gene to severe influenza. Most reported SNPs associated with severe influenza were generally based on candidategene approach (Everitt, Clare et al., 2012 , Herrera-Ramos, Lopez-Rodriguez et al., 2014 , Lee, Cao et al., 2017 . Zuniga et al conducted a GWAS of ~50,000 SNPs to discover genetic variants associated with severe pneumonia in pandemic H1N1 infection (Zuniga, Buendia et al., 2011) . Without any validation, the top five variants (the variants with the lowest P values) were reported solely based on genetic association. Our association SNPs have little connection with these five reported variants. The discrepancy is that we used a distinct strategy to select candidate association variants. With an ultimate goal of identifying important host gene(s) to affect disease outcome, rather than genetic markers associated with disease outcome, we integrated genetic association data with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Namely, we do not select those SNPs with the lowest P values; instead we chose the SNPs which may not generate the highest association signal, but are correlated to differential expression of specific host genes. When the association SNP is transformed into a specific gene, we can proceed to validate the role of the gene for influenza infection in cellular and mouse study.",

            "text": "The authors provide evidence based on an observational study in H1N1 and H7N9 patients with moderate or severe disease, that an intronic allele in the GLDC gene is associated with a more severe clinical outcome. Treatment of A549 cells with aminooxy-acetic acid combined with polyI,C transfection results in a higher type I IFN and ISG induction compared with control cells that were transfected with polyI,C only. Knock down of GLDC expression combined with polyI,C transfection had a similar effect. Treatment of A549 cells with AOAA reduced the replication of H1N1pdm and H7N9 infection, and was associated with increased type I IFN induction. Knock down of GLDC expression reduced H7N9 replication and overexpression of GLDC increased H7N9 replication in A549 cells. Finally, three consecutive intranasal AOAA treatments of mice partially protected the mice against disease following H1N1pdm challenge, which was associated with reduced virus replication and increased IFNalpha and ISG expression. The link between the susceptibility to influenza and GLDC is novel and interesting. However, many of the results are based on the use of AOAA. The specificity and potential toxicity of this drug is poorly defined. (Zhou, Li et al., 2017) . We demonstrated that GLDC overexpression significantly promoted the replication of MERS-CoV in the revised manuscript on page 7/8. The new data is submitted as new Fig 5F. The original Western Blot result is moved to Fig 5E. 3. It is unclear how specific an inhibitor of GLDC AOAA is. Also, in EV1, a concentration of 100 microM does not seem to result in a significant reduction in thymidine in A549 cells. The statement in line 122 (GLDC inhibition could suppress pyrimidine biosynthesis) is therefore not supported by the data. The specificity of AOAA should be documented with GLDC knock down or -deficient cells before conclusions based on experiments with AOAA can be made. GLCD knock down cells were generated by the authors. The statement in line 125 (GLDC inhibition triggered activation of type I IFNs) is not correct. Without polyI,C transfection there appears to be no effect on type IFN or ISG induction.",

In our experiment, although AOAA showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect, 100uM AOAA reduced the abundance of thymidine with a borderline significance (P = 0.061). We used LC-MS/MS, a very sensitive approach, to detect the amount of cellular thymidine, intending to verify the previous reports.

This is especially interesting when aligning the survival curves ( Figure 4B ) with weight loss because deaths occur on Days 5, 7, and 10 after infection. This observed weight loss can explain the deaths at Day 5 (with low weights at Day 4), but do not explain the deaths at Day 8 when weights return to nearly 100% at Day 7. The loss of weight at Day 9 corresponds with the death at Day 10. Two things are worth noting from the weight:survival comparison. First, the weight loss after infection is not consistent with the weight loss observed in other lethal models of influenza virus infection where a consistent progression toward 25-30% weight loss is observed. Second, a major loss of animals due to infection is associated with increases in group body weight (Day 7/8), while a minimal number of deaths is associated with a decrease in body weight (Day 9/10). If the authors could clarify how this weight loss is associated with the survival observed, and specifically comment on the euthanasia criteria for these animals, it would be greatly appreciated.",

All AOAA-and Zanamivir-treated mice survived the virus challenge; whilst only one PBS-treated mouse was alive at the end of the experiment, with a final survival rate of 11.1%. According to the approved protocol, we should monitor mouse body weight loss, the mice with excessive weight loss >25% are euthanized to minimize mouse suffering. Thus, the mice with weight loss >25% were excluded for body weight calculation. However, we forgot to synchronize with the survival data, which caused the discrepancy between body weight loss and survival rate.

They begin this study by identifying GLDC using a genome-wide association study in patient populations that presented with severe infections caused by either H7N9 or pandemic H1N1 viruses. Genetic evaluation of these patients showed an association between severe a GLDC SNP and severe influenza infections. The authors then tested the contribution of GLDC to severe influenza infection by initially testing the response of influenza virus-infected cells to treatment with the GLDC inhibitor (aminooxy)acetic acid (AOAA) in A549 cells. Specifically, using a luciferase system, the authors show that type I IFN expression is increased in the presence of the GLDC inhibitor AOAA, indicating that GLDC limits anti-viral activity. These findings are corroborated using siRNA studies that show increased type I IFN expression when GLDC is depleted.",

Interestingly, the increase in ISGs is both more robust and broad after infection with H7N9 when compared with H1N1, indicating potential viral gene contributions to the phenotypes observed. The authors then use both siRNA depletion of GLDC and GLDC overexpression to show that GLDC expression directly affects virus replication, type I IFN expression, and ISG levels after infection. Finally, in a mouse infection model the authors show that AOAA is as effective as zanamivir at preventing death after influenza virus infection, an outcome that is associated with increased virus levels in lungs, IFN-alpha expression, ISG expression, and detection of virus nucleoprotein in the lung.",

One major concern with the data presented is the eventual utilization of a therapeutic that targets a gene product that needs to be inhibited in order to demonstrate an effect. Treatment of individuals with this product will need to overcome variations in gene expression within the human population that my greatly influence dosing and overall effectiveness. The most direct demonstration of effectiveness in a therapeutic setting is the murine study where AOAA is used to prevent death after infection, but the initial infection is still associated with weight loss and recovery. Furthermore, the fact that AOAA is administered on days -1, 0, and +1 after infection brings into question the potential application of this therapeutic. How do the authors propose therapeutic treatment after influenza virus infection?",

In addition, co-infection is associated with higher mortality rate than primary viral infection. Thus, bacterial co-infection probably occurred in many of our severe patients. we believe that, as a potential therapeutic option, GLDC inhibition would prevent the incidence of bacterial co-infection due to the enhanced innate immunity.

Brequinar is well-characterized inhibitor of DHODH. Thus, we used brequinar to replace AOAA and performed the same H7N9 infection experiment as shown in Fig 3 and 4 . The results of brequinar experiment, now submitted as new Fig  EV3, basically recapitulated the findings of AOAA treatment. Brequinar treatment also upregulated IFN\u03b1 and ISGs and significantly reduced H7N9 replication. Thus, DHODH is another enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that acts similarly as GLDC to regulate type I IFN production. We present the new data and revised the manuscript on page 3 and page 7.",

However, in Asian, including Southern Chinese Han (CHS) and Japanese (JPT), the frequency of risk allele A is 0%. Thus, despite of its association with severe influenza in patients of European descent(Allen, Randolph et al., 2017), rs34481144 may not associate with diseases in Asian.4. Can the authors provide data or speculate as to how rs1755609 regulates GLDC expression?The association SNP rs1755609 as an eQTL of GLDC is shown in multiple tissues(https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/detail_v4.1.php?query=&id=rs1755609).HaploReg, a powerful tool for functional annotation of non-coding variants, illustrates that rs1755609 and its high linkage SNPs overlap with promoter and enhancer in multiple cell types; the mutation results in changed motifs. Thus, the altered promoter and/or enhancer activity may modulate GLDC expression. Of course, more wet-lab based studies are required to dissect the molecular mechanism by which rs1755609 regulates GLDC expression.",

Finally, can AOAA be used clinically, and does it have any potential alternative effects that could be detrimental to the progression of a virus infection and/or a secondary bacterial infection?Based on the genetic association and eQTL analysis, we demonstrated that alleles with higher GLDC-expressing alleles are associated with higher risk to H7N9 infection and severe H1N1 infection. The risk alleles are not loss-of-function variants. In addition, eQTL data delineate the genome-wide correlation of genetic variation and mRNA expression of host genes. A genetic variant correlated to higher mRNA expression of a cellular gene may result in higher protein expression. Anyway, the reviewer raised an important question. we are planning to verify in an appropriate system that cells carrying different alleles show differential levels of GLDC protein expression.We believe that GLDC expression level may not affect the baseline expression of type I IFNs and ISGs. GLDC inhibition or depletion can boost the induction of type I IFNs and ISGs only whenPRRs are stimulated or upon viral infection. Namely, the genetically-regulated differential GLDC expression in humans may not affect baseline levels of type I IFNs and ISGs; instead it can affect the magnitude of IFN and ISG induction upon viral infection.",

Still, referees 1 and 2 request additional text changes and importantly, referee 1 really would like to see additional in vitro experiments to strengthen the results, which I would strongly advise you to perform.Please submit your revised manuscript as soon as possible. ***** Reviewer's comments ***** Referee #1 (Remarks for Author):My original comments were largely requests for clarification, which the authors have mostly provided. The question raised in comment #5 asking the authors to speculate as to how the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway regulates type I IFN production was not answered. I still think that a possible mechanism should be discussed. Relating to this, I also agreed with several comments of the other reviewers and observe that many of these comments were also not addressed. Validation of the specificity of AOAA was not provided, nor was testing of other pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. These simple in vitro experiments would provide much greater confidence in the conclusions of the manuscript. Overall, I find the authors to have been largely unresponsive to the reviewer critiques.Referee #2 (Comments on Novelty/Model System for Author):Overall, the experiments allow to conclude that GLDC can negatively regulate type I IFN responses and therefore can modulate susceptibility to influenza virus infection.Referee #2 (Remarks for Author):Line 26: \"Thus, pre-existing immunity due to vaccination and prior exposure cannot account for the susceptibility to infections of these viruses\" goes against Gostic et al. who stated \"Potent protection USEFUL LINKS FOR COMPLETING THIS FORM http://www.antibodypedia.com http://1degreebio.org http://www.equator--network.org/reporting--guidelines/improving--bioscience--research--reporting--the--arrive--guidelines--for--r http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Ourresearch/Ethicsresearchguidance/Useofanimals/index.htm http://ClinicalTrials.gov http://www.consort--statement.org http://www.consort--statement.org/checklists/view/32--consort/66--title \u00e8\uf0e8 http://www.equator--network.org/reporting--guidelines/reporting--recommendations--for--tumour--marker--prognostic--studies \u00e8\uf0e8 1.a.
