Although no licensed vaccine is currently available, an engineered version of the metastable RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein-stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation by \"DS-Cav1\" mutationselicits high titer RSV-neutralizing responses. Moreover, pre-F-specific antibodies, often against the neutralization-sensitive antigenic site \u00d8 in the membrane-distal head region of trimeric F glycoprotein, comprise a substantial portion of the human response to natural RSV infection. To focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00d8, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens that comprised the membrane-distal head of the F glycoprotein in its pre-F conformation. These \"head-only\" immunogens formed monomers, dimers, and trimers. Antigenic analysis revealed that a majority of the 70 engineered head-only immunogens displayed reactivity to site \u00d8-targeting antibodies, which was similar to that of the parent RSV F DS-Cav1 trimers, often with increased thermostability. We evaluated four of these head-only immunogens in detail, probing their recognition by antibodies, their physical stability, structure, and immunogenicity. When tested in na\u00efve mice, a head-only trimer, half the size of the parent RSV F trimer, induced RSV titers, which were statistically comparable to those induced by DS-Cav1. When used to boost DS-Cav1-primed mice, two head-only RSV F immunogens, a dimer and a trimer, boosted RSV-neutralizing titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by DS-Cav1, although with higher site \u00d8directed responses. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the ability of the smaller headonly RSV F immunogens to focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00d8. Decent primary immunogenicity, enhanced physical stability, potential ease of manufacture, and potent immunogenicity upon boosting suggest these head-only RSV F immunogens, PLOS ONE |",

Young children and the elderly are especially at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection resulting in extensive morbidity and over 3.4 million hospitalizations per year [2] [3] [4] . The development of an RSV vaccine is thus a priority. To date, the most potently RSV-neutralizing antibodies recognize the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein [5] . RSV F is a type I fusion glycoprotein, comprising an F 0 precursor which is activated by furin cleavage to form a prefusion (pre-F) trimer of disulfide-linked F 2 and F 1 heterodimers [6] . The pre-F conformation of RSV F undergoes substantial structural rearrangements as it transitions to the post-fusion conformation, as part of its essential role in merging viral and host cell membranes during entry.",

As antigenic site \u00d8 is only present on the pre-F conformation of RSV F, and recombinant pre-F spontaneously rearranges to the post-fusion conformation [9] , several variants of RSV F stabilized in the pre-F form have been created for use as immunogens. DS-Cav1 [16] , DS-Cav1-Cys-zipper [17] , SC-TM [18] and SC-DM [18] , all of which preserve antigenic site \u00d8, have been shown to elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice, cotton rats, and macaques. However, antigenic site \u00d8 comprises less than 10% of the surface area of the RSV F trimer glycoprotein [9] , providing ample opportunity for antigenic competition from irrelevant or less neutralization-sensitive epitopes on RSV F. A vaccine that were to more specifically present antigenic site \u00d8 might thus have the potential to focus and to improve the quality of the antibody response.",

            "text": "Immune-focusing of the vaccine response, through the removal of extraneous epitopes from vaccine immunogens, has been observed to elicit targeted antibody responses in several studies. With RSV, incorporation of two RSV F helices from antigenic site II into a protein scaffold resulted in immunogens that could elicit binding antibodies to site II in mice [19] and-with the addition of an intervening loop-neutralizing antibodies to site II in macaques [20] , though the macaque titers appeared to be much lower than those elicited by trimeric immunogens, such as the RSV F trimer. With influenza A virus, headless or stalk-only immunogens of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein induced significantly higher titers of protective HA stemdirected antibodies than the seasonal influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine in mice [21, 22] and ferrets [22] , and HA stem-directed antibodies that reduced symptoms of disease in macaques [21] . Furthermore, with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, mice immunized with the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing S1 subunit elicited more RBD-reactive neutralizing antibodies than mice immunized with DNA for full-length spike (S) protein [23] . We therefore hypothesized that a \"head-only\" immunogen might more ably boost antigenic site \u00d8-directed responses than the complete F glycoprotein. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens comprising only the membrane-distal half (head region) of the RSV F glycoprotein, with antigenic site \u00d8 intact and the membrane-proximal half (stalk region) completely removed. Four \"head-only\" RSV F immunogens were evaluated in prime-boost mouse immunogenicity studies, with two of these boosting RSV-neutralization titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by the RSV F DS-Cav1 trimer, although increased site \u00d8-directed antibodies.",

All assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 rpm in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in order to minimize nonspecific interactions. The final volume for all solutions was 50-80 \u03bcl/well. Assays were performed at 30\u00b0C in tilted black 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, NC). RSV F head-only variants (50 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS buffer was used to load anti-His-tag probes (HIS1K) for 300 s. Typical capture levels for each loading step were between 0.6 and 1.2 nm, and variability within a row of eight tips did not exceed 0.1 nm for each of these steps. The nm unit is a measure of the change in the interference pattern of white light reflected from the surface of the biosensor tip compared to an internal reference. This was measured in real-time and correlates with a change in the number of bound molecules on the biosensor tip surface. This can also be defined as a change in response units measured in nm [25, 26] . Biosensor tips were then equilibrated for 90 s in PBS + 1% BSA prior to measuring association with antigen binding fragments (Fabs) in solution (0.016 \u03bcM to 0.5 \u03bcM) for 300 s; Fabs were then allowed to dissociate for 300-1200 s. Parallel correction to subtract systematic baseline drift was carried out by subtracting the measurements recorded for a loaded sensor incubated in PBS + 1% BSA. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Octet analysis software, version 8.0 (Pall ForteBio LLC, CA). Experimental data were fitted with a binding equation describing a 1:1 interaction. Global analyses of the complete data sets assuming reversible binding (full dissociation) were carried out using nonlinear least-squares fitting allowing a single set of binding parameters to be obtained simultaneously for all concentrations measured in a single experiment.",

The physical stability of treated RSV F head-only proteins was evaluated by retention of binding to the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the site \u00d8-specific antibody D25. All treatments were carried out at a protein concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml. For pH treatments, the RSV F glycoprotein solution was adjusted to either pH 3.5 with citrate buffer or pH 10 with N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer, incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and subsequently neutralized to pH 7.5 with Tris buffer. Temperature treatments were carried out by incubating the RSV F glycoprotein solutions at 50\u00b0C, 70\u00b0C or 90\u00b0C for 60 minutes in a PCR cycler with heated lid. For osmolarity treatments, RSV F glycoprotein solutions originally containing 150 mM NaCl were either diluted with 2.5 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) to an osmolarity of 10 mM NaCl or adjusted with 4.5 M MgCl 2 to a final concentration of 3.0 M MgCl 2 . Protein solutions were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature and then returned to 150 mM salt by adding 5 M NaCl or dilution with 2.5 mM Tris buffer, respectively, and concentrated to 50 \u03bcg/ml. The freeze/thaw treatment was carried out by repeatedly freezing RSV F glycoprotein solutions in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37\u00b0C ten times. All RSV F glycoproteins were diluted to 80 \u03bcg/ml with PBS + 1% BSA to reduce non-specific binding, and their ability to bind D25 Fab was measured with a fort\u00e9Bio Octet instrument using the protocol described below.",

We therefore designed 70 variants of head-only RSV F constructs using three different approaches (Fig 1C and S1 Table) . For the first approach, domain III was expressed as a simple monomer (30 designs); in the second approach, domain III was expressed as a tandemly linked dimer (18 designs); in the third approach, a trimerization domain was fused to domain III to enable the expression of a trimeric protein resembling the native pre-fusion RSV F head (22 designs). The topology of RSV F is such that removal of the RSV F stalk from the RSV F head results in two separate F 1 and F 2 polypeptides within each head protomer. Reconnection of both polypeptides to make a single polypeptide afforded an opportunity to permute circularly the domain topology, by linking either F 2 to F 1 , or F 1 to F 2 (S1 Fig). Most designs also incorporated the disulfide bond from DS-Cav1 (S155C-S290C) as well as the DS-Cav1 cavity filling mutations (S190F and V207L) [16] to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation. Numerous additional mutations included repacking of the protein interior, the addition of disulfide bonds, and the alteration of surface mutations to replace hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic residues or glycans. Moreover, various lengths of glycine rich linkers were used to link the two polypeptides of domain III and to connect them to trimerization domains. Finally, a signal peptide for secretion and a cleavable His-tag and Strep-tag to aid in purification were added to each construct. The signal peptide is colored yellow, F 2 is colored blue, F 1 is colored green, the transmembrane region is colored cyan and the cytoplasmic domain is colored gray. (B) Pre-F form of the RSV F trimer. One protomer of RSV F is depicted as a ribbon diagram and colored as in A. The other two protomers are gray surface representations. Antigenic site \u00d8 and site II are red and orange respectively. Domains I, II and III are labeled as defined previously [9, 35] .

For each immunogen a cartoon of the genetic construct is depicted (top) and a ribbon diagram (bottom), color-coded as in A and B with brown coloring for purification tags. PDB entries 4JHW [9] , 1RFO [36] and 1GCM [37] were used to depict RSV F, the foldon and the coiled coil respectively. RSV F residue numbering follows the numbering in PDB entry 4JHW [9] .",

As several of the most potently neutralizing RSV F antibodies target antigenic site \u00d8, three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for this site were used as readout: antibodies D25, 5C4 and AM22. Additionally, because soluble RSV F trimers are metastable and spontaneously convert to a post-fusion conformation, D25 binding was also evaluated after one week at 4\u00b0C, and AM22 and 5C4 binding were evaluated after two and five weeks, respectively, at 4\u00b0C. Out of 70 designs, 51 (73%) had D25 ELISA readouts of 1.5 OD 450 or higher after one week at 4\u00b0C (S2-S4 Tables). To further gauge the stability of these immunogens, D25 recognition was also evaluated after one hour at 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100\u00b0C. Fifty of the head-only designs retained the majority of their D25 antigenicity after one hour at 70\u00b0C, conditions under which the parent DS-Cav1 RSV F trimer completely lost D25 recognition [16] . At 80\u00b0C and above, we observed a substantial decrease in D25 binding for most of the head-only immunogens (S2-S4 Tables).",

In each instance, the prime interval was three weeks and the boost interval was seven weeks. Such a boost may mimic the boosting of individuals who have been previously exposed to RSV. Notably, week 12 sera showed head-only boosting to elicit geometric mean titers for i-693 and i-447 of 14,844 and 12,998, respectively, which were statistically comparable with the mean titers for the RSV F DS-Cav1 control of 10,548 ( Fig 4B) . Interestingly, reversing the prime-boost (headonly prime followed by a DS-Cav1 boost) resulted in a significantly lower responses for both i-693 and i-447 (P = 0.0052 and 0.0354 respectively) (S5 Fig). Thus the dimeric i-693 and the trimeric i-447 did not appear to prime as well as the full length DS-Cav1, but they did appear to focus and to boost the head-directed neutralizing response.",

We previously developed DS-Cav1 probes with knock-out (KO) mutations in antigenic site \u00d8 or antigenic site II [15] , and we used these site-specific KO probes to quantify the site-specific immune response. First, we measured the relative binding affinity of immune sera to DS-Cav1, DS-Cav1 site \u00d8-KO, and DS-Cav1 site II-KO probes. With the homologous DS-Cav1 prime/boost sera, no significant difference was observed in binding to the three probes ( Fig 5A) . This was not entirely surprising given that the individual knock-out mutations for antigenic sites \u00d8 and II cover only a small percentage (1-3%) of the surface area of their respective probes. In contrast, the site \u00d8-KO probe bound significantly less to both i-447 and i-693 boosted sera (P = 0.0015 and 0.0021 respectively) than to the DS-Cav1 probe (Fig 5A) . The site II-KO probe also bound significantly less to i-447 boosted sera than to the DS-Cav1 probe (P = 0.0015), but its binding was statistically comparable to DS-Cav1 with i-693 boosted sera. We next measured the competitive effect of DS-Cav1 antigenic site \u00d8 and site II KO probes on neutralization. DS-Cav1 added to sera from each of the three groups of immunized mice (3\u00d7DS-Cav1, 2\u00d7DS-Cav1 + 1\u00d7i-693 and 2\u00d7DS-Cav1 + 1\u00d7i-447) competed for sera very efficiently as expected, resulting in significantly reduced neutralization (P = <0.0001) (Fig 5B) . However, the site \u00d8 KO and site II KO probes competed much less effectively than DS-Cav1, highlighting the importance of these sites (Fig 5B) . In the DS-Cav1 and i-693-boosted group, antigenic site II KO probe competed more strongly than the antigenic site \u00d8 KO probe (P = 0.0354 and 0.0431 respectively), indicating antigenic site \u00d8 to be the dominant target of neutralization by these sera. In the i-447-boosted group, however, there was no significant difference in neutralization competition between antigenic site \u00d8 and site II KO probes. Thus, with regards to site-specific induced responses, our results indicate the RSV-neutralizing response boosted by head-only immunogens i-693 and i-447 to indeed be more focused on head-specific sites \u00d8 and II, especially antigenic site \u00d8.",

            "text": "A major goal for RSV-vaccine development is to identify immunogens that can boost antibody responses to neutralization-sensitive epitopes in the setting of pre-existing immunity. Increasing serum-neutralizing activity in pregnant women would help to increase their protective response and to extend the period of maternally-acquired protection from RSV. Likewise, in elderly people who have experienced repeated RSV infections throughout life, but still have modest levels of serum-neutralizing activity, boosting the response to neutralization-sensitive epitopes could achieve greater than threshold levels of protective immunity. Therefore, we took a structure-based design approach to produce immunogens that focused immune recognition on the apical surfaces of the pre-F trimer. We removed the stalk portion from the RSV F trimeric glycoprotein to create 70 RSV F head-only immunogens. Fifty of these designs were recognized by antibodies to the metastable antigenic site \u00d8 (D25, AM22 and 5C4) and were stable for at least one hour at 70\u00b0C, a temperature at which DS-Cav1 rapidly inactivates (Table 1) . The thermostable head-only immunogens included 26 monomers, 6 dimers, and 18 trimers. Four of these, a monomer (i-273), a dimer (i-693) and two trimers (i-210 and i-447), were expressed, purified, and characterized for antigenicity, overall stability, structural integrity, and immunogenicity. Although all four of these head-only immunogens displayed nanomolar affinity to antigenic site \u00d8-directed antibodies and had physical stability that was similar or exceeded that of DS-Cav1, only one of the immunogens (the i-447 trimer) was able to elicit RSV-neutralizing titers in mice that were comparable to those elicited by DS-Cav1 (Fig 4A) . The lower overall immunogenicity of these head-only immunogens may relate to increased flexibility between protomers, as we recently found that the reduction of interprotomer flexibility in pre-F trimers yielded higher immunogenicity [42] .",

This suggests that antigenic site II may potentially play a role in the overall effectiveness of the head-only immunogens, which is consistent with the neutralization competition data (Fig 5B) . The small size and extensive surface mutagenesis of the i-273 monomer, and the greater structural heterogeneity and surface mutations of the i-210 trimer relative to i-447 may also have diminished the capabilities of these head-only immunogens.",

Indeed, full length RSV F protein has been successfully expressed in apples [51] , tomatoes [52] , and insect cells [53] .

However, such immunogen designs could be complicated if both non-proximal antigenic sites \u00d8 and II were retained or if increased T cell help from the addition of universal T cell epitope peptides [58, 59] is required for the smallest immunogens. Although we did not observe a consistent correlation between oligomer size (i.e. monomer, dimer and trimer) and neutralization titers or immune focusing, increasing the immunogen oligomerization state in an ordered manner might also be expected to improve immune focusing since it would provide more opportunities for irrelevant epitopes to be masked by neighbor-neighbor interactions and the additional multivalency of the target epitope could lead to increased B cell avidity through antibody crosslinking, resulting in increased immunogenicity for the epitope [41, 60] . Therefore, additional multimerization by incorporation into nanoparticles [53, 61] might further improve both immune focusing and overall immunogenicity of the head-only RSV F immunogens.",

Results from the \"best\" four immunogens, nonetheless, already demonstrate the ability of head-only RSV F immunogens to boost to high titers previously elicited RSV-neutralizing responses to the RSV F glycoprotein. Together, these results indicate the head-only immunogens, i-693 and i-447, to be particularly suited to boosting RSV F-specific antibody responses in the setting of pre-existing immunity-a result of particular significance for maternal immunization and for vaccine protection of the elderly. The left panel shows a ribbon diagram of domain III consisting of polypeptides F 1 (green) and F 2 (blue). Antigenic site \u00d8 and site II are red and orange respectively. The middle and right panels depict two separate ways to reconnect F 1 and F 2 into a single chain through the addition of linkers (dotted lines). A cartoon of the genetic construct is shown above each ribbon diagram depicting the topology of the F 1 (green) and F 2 (blue) polypeptides. ",

(A) All four immunogens were used to immunize mice two times, resulting in high neutralization titers for i-693 and i-447 above the protective threshold of 100 (dotted line). P values between i-447 and i-210 or i-273 were 0.001 and <0.0001 respectively and those between i-693 and i-210 or i-273 were 0.0014 and <0.0001 respectively.
