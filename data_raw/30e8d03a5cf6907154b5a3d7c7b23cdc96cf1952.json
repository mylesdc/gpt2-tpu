            "text": "Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a particularly severe disease in immunocompromised patients. Its diagnosis remains difficult and is often based on a body of arguments built around host, clinical, radiological and mycological criteria such as those defined jointly by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) (De Pauw et al., 2008) . Although not included in these criteria, the detection of Aspergillus DNA in blood samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has a long history of use and has been shown to be a very interesting test for diagnosing IA in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients (Suarez et al., 2008; Imbert et al., 2016) . Moreover, this approach has been shown to have predictive ability for disease outcome (Imbert et al., 2016) . There is now a consensus among experts for its inclusion in the EORTC/MSG criteria (White et al., 2015; Patterson et al., 2016; Ullmann et al., 2018) . Even if less sampled because of their invasiveness, respiratory samples, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, may be useful for IA diagnosis. EORTC/MSG recommend the use of galactomannan in BAL as a mycological criterion (De Pauw et al., 2008) , even if studies show heterogeneity in performances and the optimal cut-off value is not definitively determined (Zou et al., 2012) . Aspergillus PCR is also practicable in BAL samples. Some studies showed promising performances, however, less is known concerning its potential usefulness (Tuon, 2007; Zou et al., 2012; Grancini et al., 2018; Guegan et al., 2018) .",

Considering this, we assessed the ability of the fungal load to predict the clinical form of aspergillosis and to distinguish between invasive, non-invasive and non-aspergillosis diseases. The analysis of PCRpositive BAL and numbers of copies expressed in Log10 showed that this latter was significantly higher in BAL sampled from patients with aspergillosis, in comparison with BAL sampled from patients with non-aspergillosis conditions (p < 0.0005 by t-test; Figure 3A) .

For this analysis, three PCR-negative invasive cases (one due to A. nidulans [not detected by the employed PCR technique] and two with no lung involvement) were excluded. ROC curves indicated that a cut-off of 500 copies/mL was the optimal threshold (Supplementary Figure S1) . Patients with PCR results strictly below 500 copies/mL had a significantly higher probability of survival 90 days after the diagnosis (n = 10/13; 76.9% survival), compared to those with PCR results at or above this cut-off (n = 6/19; 31.6% survival; median survival of 28 days) (p < 0.05 with Log-rank test) ( Figure 4A) .

            "text": "Aspergillus DNA detection for the diagnosis of aspergillosis has been the subject of studies for more than 20 years (Yamakami et al., 1996) . Numerous authors, having demonstrated sensitivities ranging from 72 to 88% and specificities from 75 to 98.7%, are now stating that Aspergillus PCR in blood is an interesting tool for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in at-risk patients (Mengoli et al., 2009; Arvanitis et al., 2014 Arvanitis et al., , 2015 Imbert et al., 2016) . Nonetheless, for the moment, expert consensus recommends its use only with certain precautions and opinions still diverge (Patterson et al., 2016) . Furthermore, we note that in the literature, the performance of Aspergillus PCR has been assessed in blood samples much more frequently than it has in respiratory samples, such as BAL or sputum. Above all, the literature is essentially focused on patients with hematological conditions (Sun et al., 2011; Torelli et al., 2011; Hoenigl et al., 2014; Boch et al., 2016) , and few included other populations (Luong et al., 2011; Guegan et al., 2018) . Our present work indicates that PCR performed in BAL is of particular interest for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, providing 88.6% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. These values are similar to those reported in previous reports, which showed sensibilities ranging from 71 to 82% and specificities from 92.8 to 98% (Tuon, 2007; Luong et al., 2011; Grancini et al., 2018; Guegan et al., 2018) . Particularly, the rate for sensitivity observed for PCR in BAL was superior to those observed for the GM index whatever the cut-off used (0.5 or 1), and mycological culture. This was already demonstrated for mycological culture, but it is in contradiction with previous report for GM, which showed higher sensitivity than PCR (Guegan et al., 2018) . We also underline that sensitivity was 96.9% when the analysis was limited to cases of invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary involvement and A. fumigatus as the causative species. The last pulmonary case was diagnosed with clinical and radiological evidences and positive GM and PCR in serum. Culturing is always performed as it enables the isolation of any fungus, i.e., yeast and mold. Retrieving the strain also permits the evaluation of the susceptibility of the fungus to antifungal drugs via the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations. GM determination is strongly recommended for diagnosis and screening in patients with hematological conditions but not those with other conditions, such as solid organ transplant recipients (Patterson et al., 2016) . In contrast, our work indicates that PCR is interesting in both hematological and non-hematological patients, including those solid organ transplant recipients who account for a third of the concerned population. These, demonstrate its usefulness in intensive care unit patients, whom diagnosis of IA remains difficult and needs improvements, as previously reported (Guegan et al., 2018) .",

The positivity of PCR in respiratory samples may be due to invasive aspergillosis, chronic aspergillosis or a clinically irrelevant situation (i.e., contamination or fortuitous colonization). Interestingly, we found that fungal load can distinguish between aspergillosis and non-aspergillosis pathologies and thus may be useful for discriminating between infection and colonization. However, in our study and in contradiction with a previous work (Luong et al., 2011; Grancini et al., 2018) , fungal load was not able to distinguish between invasive and non-invasive forms. This finding was not particularly surprising as both invasive and chronic pathologies may involve a high fungal burden.",

We note that the proportions of patients with hematological conditions and of patients who were neutropenic were smaller in this study than in our previous work on PCR in serum. In that work, we also reported that the initial fungal load determined by PCR in serum was highly predictive of 90-day mortality (Imbert et al., 2016) . Therefore, although BAL is not a physiological sample and is subject to procedure variations affecting its dilution, we investigated whether Aspergillus DNA quantification in BAL could be used to predict the outcome of invasive disease. When we focused on invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, we found that a PCR threshold of 500 copies/mL could discriminate patients with low (below the threshold) or high (above) probabilities of 90day mortality. Of note, the GM index also discriminates between these two groups, but for this analysis, it included numerous false negatives (i.e., with a cut-off < 1). This suggests that GM may be better suited for the prediction of outcome rather than diagnosis.",

Evaluate diagnosis performances of the tests, may so include some bias. To avoid inclusion bias for the tests we wanted to evaluate (i.e., GM and PCR in BAL), we excluded them from the diagnosis criteria. Secondly, the PCR we use is specific to the A. fumigatus species and thus cannot amplify the genomes of other important species such as A. flavus, or A. niger. However, looking at the cases of invasive aspergillosis with a positive culture-and therefore an identification at the species level-there was only one case of non-fumigatus (A. nidulans) diagnosed in our series, which echoes findings from one of our previous studies (Imbert et al., 2016) . Furthermore, even commercial multiplex approaches can lack relevant species such as A. nidulans (Chong et al., 2016) . The last limitation is that this method is not designed to detect antifungal drug resistance, particularly Cyp51A-mediated azole resistance. However, that involves treatment rather than diagnosis. This latter remains the main purpose of Aspergillus PCR, but the technique could be improved by adding a Cyp51A gene-targeted PCR (Buil et al., 2018) .",

However, the PCR method employed in this study was not designed to detect non-fumigatus species; efforts are necessary to overcome that limit. Moreover, PCR permits the quantification of fungal load, which, in positive cases, might be used to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination or clinically irrelevant colonization. The results of this study also indicate that in cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, a threshold of 500 copies/mL is useful to discriminate patients with low (below the threshold) or high (above) probabilities of 90-day mortality.
