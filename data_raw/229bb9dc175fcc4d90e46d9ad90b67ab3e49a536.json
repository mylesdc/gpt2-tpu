The blockade of SIV by IFITMs is isolate specific, raising the question of which parameters impact sensitivity to IFITM. We show that the virion context in which SIV-Env is presented and the efficiency of virion incorporation determine Env susceptibility to inhibition by IFITMs. Thus, determinants other than the nature of the envelope protein can impact the IFITM sensitivity of viral entry. IMPORTANCE The host cell-encoded IFITM proteins can block viral entry and are an important component of the innate defenses against viral infection. However, the determinants controlling whether a virus is susceptible to blockade by IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Our study shows that the amount of envelope proteins incorporated into virions as well as the nature of the virion particle itself can impact the sensitivity of viral entry to IFITMs. These results show for the first time that determinants other than the viral envelope protein can impact sensitivity to IFITM and have implications for the interpretation of previously published data on inhibition of viruses by IFITM proteins. Moreover, our findings might help to define the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.",

Thus, one would assume that entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is believed to proceed mainly at the plasma membrane, is not inhibited. The laboratories reporting the identification of IFITMs as antiviral factors indeed failed to detect an IFITM-dependent blockade of HIV-1 infection (4, 6) . Nevertheless, subsequent studies reported that IFITMs restrict HIV and SIV entry (11, 17, 18) . More recently, it was reported that IFITMs are incorporated into progeny HIV and SIV virions and that IFITM expression in infected cells reduces the infectivity of progeny virions (19, 20) . The negative impact on infectivity might be due to IFITM interactions with Env, which result in reduced Env processing and incorporation into virions (21) . However, the HIV-1 and SIV sensitivity to IFITM is isolate specific and the reasons why some isolates are efficiently inhibited while others are not are unknown (17, 21) .",

For this, we used previously described vector systems that allow for sensitive detection of viral entry and for robust and comparable expression of IFITM proteins in transduced cells (22, 23) .

            "text": "Entry of MLV and SIV vectors pseudotyped with FLUAV-HA/NA was reduced by 60 to 80% upon expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3, while MLV-Env-driven entry was barely inhibited by IFITM proteins, as expected (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, entry of retroviral particles bearing SIV-Env was only modestly reduced by IFITM proteins. In contrast, expression of all IFITM proteins reduced entry of VSV vectors bearing MLV-Env, SIV-Env, or FLUAV-HA by at least 60% (MLV-Env) or 80% (SIV-Env, FLUAV-HA) (Fig. 1A ) and the relative susceptibility to inhibition by IFITM proteins was not dependent on the amount of particles used for transduction (not shown). These results raised the question of whether Env proteins presented on VSV vectors are generally more susceptible to inhibition by IFITM proteins or whether other factors accounted for the differential inhibition. For instance, the reduced IFITM sensitivity of MLV and SIV vectors relative to VSV vectors could be due to reduced glycoprotein incorporation and/or generally diminished entry efficiency of the latter, which might increase IFITM sensitivity. However, Western blot analysis of SIV-Env incorporation into MLV, SIV, and VSV particles did not point toward major differences (Fig. 1B) , although the ratio of gp120 to gp160 was somewhat higher for MLV than for SIV/VSV particles (not shown) and a comparison of the luciferase values measured in lysates of transduced cells revealed that relative sensitivity to IFITM was not linked to entry efficiency (not shown). Alternatively, gene expression from VSV but not MLV or SIV vectors might be inhibited by IFITMs. To address this, we used a VSV minireplicon system dependent on the expression of T7 polymerase and cells stably expressing IFITM2 or -3, in which antiviral activity of IFITMs can be more readily visualized than in transduced cells. Transfection of 293T control cells and cells stably expressing IFITM2 or IFITM3 with plasmids encoding the minireplicon system yielded comparable signals (Fig. 1C) , indicating that VSV gene expression was not inhibited by IFITMs. Moreover, transduction of these cells by VSV vectors bearing Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC), which is known to be IFITM insensitive (6) , was only slightly inhibited by IFITMs, and similar results were obtained for a vector bearing the Nipah virus glycoproteins (NiV-G/F) (Fig. 1D ), in keeping with the concept that IFITMs do not block VSV gene expression. In contrast, transduction mediated by FLUAV-HA was strongly blocked by IFITM2 and IFITM3 expression (Fig. 1D) , confirming that the IFITM proteins exerted antiviral activity in the cell lines tested. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IFITMs do not interfere with VSV gene expression, a finding compatible with a previous study examining the sensitivity of intact VSV to blockade by IFITM proteins and tetherin (24) . As a consequence, one must postulate that the particle context in which a viral glycoprotein is presented can impact sensitivity to IFITM, with VSV-based vectors being associated with higher IFITM sensitivity than retroviral vectors.",

For this, particles based on HIV Gag and Ebola virus (EBOV) VP40 proteins fused to the \u2423 fragment of \u2424-galactosidase were pseudotyped with VSV-G and used to transduce 293T cells stably expressing IFITM2 or -3. In addition, the target cells were transfected to express the fragment of \u2424-galactosidase. VSV-G was chosen for pseudotyping of the Gag and VP40 particles, because only this glycoprotein (and not, for instance, EBOV glycoprotein [EBOV-GP] or HIV-Env) consistently yielded signals 30-to 50-fold over background. VSV-G-driven entry was previously shown to be modestly inhibited by IFITM2 and IFITM3 (6), a finding confirmed in the present study with a VSV vector (Fig. 1D ). In keeping with these findings, VSV-G-driven entry of Gag particles into cells expressing IFITM2 or -3 was reduced by up to 70% relative to entry into control cells (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, IFITM2 expression had no appreciable impact on VSV-G-driven entry of VP40 particles and blockade of entry by IFITM3 was less efficient than that measured for Gag particles (Fig.  1E) . These results provide further evidence that the efficiency of the inhibition of viral entry by IFITMs can depend on the nature of the virions presenting the entry-mediating viral glycoproteins.",

The observations that SIV variants can differ in the efficiency of Env incorporation into virions (25, 26) and in sensitivity to IFITM (17) stimulated us to investigate whether these two processes are linked. To answer this question, we produced MLV particles in cells transfected with increasing amounts of SIV-Env-or MLV-Env-encoding plasmids, employing the conditions described for Fig.  1B . The differences in the amount of Env incorporated into virions had no effect on IFITM sensitivity of MLV-Env-driven entry ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, we had previously observed that the efficiency of virion incorporation of the EBOV-GP does not alter sensitivity to IFITM (27) . In contrast, reducing the amount of SIV-Env in MLV particles markedly increased IFITM sensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . This effect was confirmed in the rhesus macaque-derived sMAGI (simian multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator) cell line (28) , which expresses endogenous IFITM3 (Fig. 2B) . Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of IFITM3 expression (Fig. 2B) markedly increased FLUAV infection, as expected, and augmented the efficiency of SIV-Env-mediated transduction (Fig. 2C) . The latter effect was inversely correlated with the efficiency of virion incorporation of SIV-Env (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that the number of SIV-Env trimers present on the virion surface can impact sensitivity to IFITM.",

It is thus of significant interest to determine the full range of viruses susceptible to inhibition by IFITMs. It is well established that IFITMs target host cell entry (6) , and several studies employed vector systems to determine whether viral entry is blocked by IFITM expression (6, 7, 22, 27) . We observed that SIV-Env-and MLV-Env-driven entry is IFITM sensitive when these glycoproteins are presented in the context of VSV, but not MLV or SIV, particles. These findings were not due to differential transduction efficiency or major differences in particle incorporation of Env, although it should be pointed out that Gag/M-protein levels cannot be directly compared and that minor differences in particle incorporation efficiency might have remained undetected. Similarly, these observations were not due to a differential impact of IFITMs on retroviral or rhabdoviral gene expression, which were both unaffected ( Fig. 1C and data not shown) . Notably, virus-like particles (spherical) based on HIV-p55Gag and harboring VSV-G exhibited a higher sensitivity toward inhibition by IFITM2 and -3 than the corresponding particles based on EBOV VP40 (filamentous), and no appreciable differences in particle incorporation of VSV-G were observed (not shown). Therefore, one must postulate that sensitivity of viral Error bars indicate SD. The results were confirmed in three separate experiments. Numbers above bars indicate the averages from four independent experiments for which transduction of control cells was set as 100%. Statistical analysis was carried out for normalized data. (B) sMAGI cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and IFITM3 expression was analyzed by an immunoblot assay employing an IFITM3-specific antibody. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. (C) sMAGI cells transfected as described for panel B were transduced with MLV vectors bearing escalating amounts of SIV-Env, and transduction efficiency was determined as described for panel A. In addition, the cells were infected with FLUAV encoding Gaussia luciferase, and luciferase expression in culture supernatants was analyzed at 48 h postinfection. The average from three independent experiments (two for FLUAV) is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. glycoproteins to IFITMs can depend on the virion context. It can be speculated that virions of different shapes might exhibit a different propensity to be taken up into the cell via certain uptake mechanisms and thus to be exposed to IFITM proteins. As a consequence, studies with viral vector systems must be complemented by examination of authentic viruses to draw firm conclusions regarding IFITM sensitivity.",

This finding suggests that differences in Env incorporation could contribute to the differential IFITM sensitivity of SIV-isolates. In contrast, the amount of MLV-Env (present study) or EBOV-GP (27) inserted into particles does not modulate IFITM sensitivity. These discrepant observations might be accounted for by differential inhibition of these glycoproteins by IFITMs. Thus, it has been documented that amphotericin B treatment rescues SIV but not EBOV-GP-mediated entry from blockade by IFITMs (17, 27) , demonstrating that IFITMs can indeed interfere with viral entry via different mechanisms. Moreover, the recent demonstration that Env and IFITMs interact in transfected cells (shown for HIV-1 Env in reference 21) raises the question of whether such interactions also occur during entry and might contribute to the IFITM-mediated entry blockade. In this case, increasing the amount of SIV-Env in the particle envelope might allow the Env to surpass in titer the IFITM molecules available to inhibit viral entry.",

Plasmids encoding the glycoproteins of murine leukemia virus (MLV-Env) (32), FLUAV (strain A/WSN/33, FLUAV-HA; neuraminidase was coexpressed during particle production to ensure efficient particle release) (33), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) (34), Nipah virus (NiV-F, NiV-G) (35), Machupo virus (MACV-GPC) (6) , and SIVmac239 (SIV-Env) (23) have been described previously. The MLV-based vector pQCXIP encoding IFITM proteins or CAT and the MLV gag-pol-encoding plasmid were previously described (22) and were employed for expression of IFITM proteins in 293T cells. Vector MLV-luc (22) and the SIV-based vector SIVmac239 \u0394env \u0394nef Luc (23), both encoding firefly luciferase (fLuc), were also previously reported and were used to quantify transduction mediated by the viral glycoproteins under study. The plasmids encoding EBOV VP40 and HIV-1 p55 Gag fused with the \u2423 fragment of \u2424-galactosidase and the plasmid encoding the fragment of \u2424-galactosidase have also been documented previously (36, 37) . A VSV minigenome (VSV-mini) was constructed as follows. First, the genetic information for all VSV genes and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was excised from the pUC18_VSV24* plasmid, a modified VSV genome in which each gene is flanked by identical restriction sites for convenient cloning (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer), making use of AvrII and NheI restriction sites of the nucleoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. By this process, only the leader and trailer sequences of the parental VSV genome were left between the T7 promoter (T7Pro) at the 5= end and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV-R) and the T7 terminator (T7Ter) at the 3= end. Next, a chimeric reporter gene consisting of eGFP and fLuc (eGFP-fLuc), fused via a linker sequence (GGG CCC GAT CCT CCT GTT GCT ACT), was generated by overlap extension PCR and ligated between the leader and trailer sequences, yielding a VSV minigenome of positive orientation (5=-T7Pro-leader-eGFP-fLuc-trailer-HDV-R-T7Ter \u03ea3=). To generate expression plasmids for VSV-N, -P, and -L, which together build the viral polymerase complex responsible for genome replication and synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, the respective ORFs from the pUC18_VSV24* plasmid were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCAGGS vector by restriction digest (VSV-N, EcoRI/NheI; VSV-P, EcoRI/NheI; VSV-L, NheI/NheI) and ligation. All PCR-amplified sequences were verified by automated sequencing.",

Subsequently, the cells were transduced with SIV, MLV, and VSV vectors encoding luciferase and bearing the indicated viral glycoproteins. The average from two to four independent experiments performed with triplicate samples is shown. Transduction of control cells was set as 100%. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means (SEM). In representative experiments, the following luciferase activities were measured in lysates of control cells, which were transduced with the following vectors (values are in counts per second \u03ee standard deviations [SD]). SIV vector pseudotyped with SIV-Env, 393,525 \u03ee 15,044; MLV-Env, 448,071 \u03ee 7,943; FLUAV-HA, 687,410 \u03ee 36,187.

(B) The indicated amounts of SIV-Env-encoding plasmid were transfected into cells employed for production of SIV, MLV, and VSV vectors. Culture supernatants were collected, concentrated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and analyzed for SIV-Env, MLV-Gag, SIV-Gag, and VSV-M proteins by Western blotting, employing antibodies raised against these proteins. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. (C) Plasmids encoding a VSV minigenome and viral N, P, and L proteins were transfected into 293T cells stably expressing IFITM2, IFTIM3, or control cells in the presence and absence of a T7-polymeraseencoding plasmid. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined. The results of a single experiment conducted with triplicate samples are shown and were confirmed in a separate experiment. Error bars indicate SD. (D) VSV vectors encoding luciferase and harboring the indicated viral glycoproteins or no glycoprotein (pCAGGS) were inoculated onto 293T cells stably expressing IFITM2 or -3 or CAT (control). The results of a single experiment conducted with quadruplicate samples are shown and were confirmed in two separate experiments. Errors bar indicate SD. (E) Virus-like particles based on HIV-1 p55 Gag (black bars) and Ebola virus VP40 (white bars) fused to the \u2423 fragment of \u2424-galactosidase and harboring VSV-G were added to cells stably expressing CAT or the indicated IFITM proteins and transiently expressing the fragment of \u2424-galactosidase. Entry efficiency was determined by quantifying \u2424-galactosidase levels in cell lysates. The results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate SD. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. Numbers above bars indicate the averages from three independent experiments for which transduction of control cells was set as 100%.
