CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response.

In another study comparing 129 patients with a diagnosis of tickborne encephalitis virus infection and 79 subjects with aseptic meningitis negative for tickborne encephalitis and 134 healthy controls, a higher frequency of the homozygous \u039432/\u039432 genotype was observed among patients with tickborne encephalitis, particularly among severe cases of the disease [20] .",
