Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",

Many viruses including alpha and gammaherpesviruses, influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus accelerate host mRNA degradation through the use of viral proteins that trigger endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Each of these viral proteins bypasses the rate-limiting deadenylation step of the basal decay pathway, resulting in cleaved mRNAs that are rapidly degraded by the major cellular 5'\u00c03' exonuclease Xrn1 Gaglia et al., 2012) . This process, termed 'host shutoff', allows viruses to rapidly restrict cellular gene expression in order to blunt immune responses and liberate resources for viral replication Burgess and Mohr, 2015; Gaglia and Glaunsinger, 2010; Rivas et al., 2016) . Viral endonucleases have also served as tools for deciphering how cells sense and respond to large changes in mRNA abundance.",

In yeast, a buffering system exists in which Xrn1 plays a major role in connecting mRNA synthesis and decay, presumably allowing cells to maintain an appropriate overall mRNA abundance. Mammalian cells also have a mechanism to sense mRNA levels, though the pathway appears to operate differently than in yeast. Here, accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation does not lead to a compensatory increase in mRNA synthesis, as might be predicted by the homeostatic model, but instead decreases cellular RNAPII promoter recruitment, thereby amplifying the restrictive gene expression environment . Significant transcriptional repression as measured by nascent mRNA production was reported to occur at approximately 9% of host genes, although validation experiments suggested this number is likely to be an underestimate .",

Herpesviral endonucleases, including the muSOX protein of MHV68, cleave mRNA but do not impact the abundance of noncoding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) or III (RNAPIII) . Correspondingly, muSOX-induced mRNA decay elicits a significant decrease in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment to cellular promoters . Notably, depletion of Xrn1 from muSOX-expressing cells prevents the ensuing RNAPII transcriptional repression. This suggests that the initial mRNA cleavage and translational inactivation are insufficient to restrict RNAPII recruitment, and that subsequent exonucleolytic degradation of the cleaved mRNA fragments is a critical signaling step. eLife digest The nucleus of a cell harbors DNA, which contains all information needed to build an organism. The instructions are stored as a genetic code that serves as a blueprint for making proteins -molecules that are important for almost every process in the body -and to assemble cells. But first, the code on the DNA needs to be translated with the help of a 'middle man', known as messenger RNA. These molecules carry information to other parts of the cell, wherever it is needed.",

Messenger RNAs are coated with proteins, which are released when the RNA is destroyed. To test if some of those proteins travel back to the nucleus to influence the production of messenger RNA, proteins in human cells grown in the laboratory were labeled with specific trackers. RNA destruction was induced, in a way that is similar to what happens during a virus attack. The experiments revealed that many RNA-binding proteins indeed return to the nucleus when RNA is destroyed.

TMT labeling enables multiplexing of up to 11 samples per run and was proven to improve the analytical power for quantitation during viral infections (McAlister et al., 2012; Jean Beltran et al., 2016) . We used HEK293T cells expressing the MHV68 muSOX endonuclease to create a condition of accelerated, Xrn1-dependent cytoplasmic mRNA decay. We previously demonstrated that muSOX expression in these cells activates the mRNA decay-RNAPII transcription feedback pathway similar to virally infected fibroblasts . Pure populations of cells expressing either WT muSOX or the catalytically dead D219A muSOX point mutant were generated using Thy1.1-based cell sorting. Here, muSOX was fused to the cell surface glycoprotein Thy1.1 with an intervening self-cleaving 2A protease, causing release of Thy1.1 from muSOX for cell surface expression and selection. Three biological replicates of control, WT, and D219A muSOX expressing cells were then separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and trypsin-digested proteins from each fraction were differentially TMT labeled prior to LC/MS-MS ( Figure 1A) .",

Thus, the binding state of poly(A) tail associated proteins could theoretically serve as a readout to distinguish the overall abundance of mRNA over other forms of RNA in the cytoplasm. Notably, nuclear relocalization of PABPC has been observed during infection with multiple viruses that promote mRNA decay, supporting the idea that poly(A) tail associated proteins may be particularly sensitive to mRNA abundance (Harb et al., 2008; Lee and Glaunsinger, 2009; Park et al., 2014; Piron et al., 1998; Salaun et al., 2010) . Indeed, an overrepresentation analysis using Pantherdb revealed that poly(A) binding proteins, poly(U) binding proteins, and mRNA 3'UTR binding proteins were significantly overrepresented among the 67 differentially expressed proteins ( Figure 1C , Figure 1 -figure supplement 1B-C). Proteins linked to the poly(A) tail consistently arose as robust hits in our MS dataset, including PABPC proteins 1 and 4 (PABPC1, PABPC4), LA-related protein 4 (LARP4), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (HNRNPQ) ( Table S3 in Supplementary file 1, Figure 1D ). We confirmed that PABPC1 and LARP4 also translocate to the nucleus in NIH3T3 cells infected with WT MHV68, but not in cells infected with an MHV68 muSOX mutant virus (R443I) with impaired mRNA cleavage activity (Adler et al., 2000; Richner et al., 2011 ) ( Figure 1E ). Thus, poly(A) associated proteins preferentially move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to muSOX-activated mRNA decay in both transiently transfected and virally infected cells.",

In the absence of Xrn1, muSOX-induced repression of RNAPII promoter occupancy does not occur, suggesting that Xrn1 activity should be required for release and subsequent nuclear translocation of RBPs involved in this phenotype . We therefore used Cas9-based genome editing to generate Xrn1 knockout clones in HEK293T cells and confirmed that muSOX expression in these cells failed to reduce RNAPII promoter occupancy ( (Larimer and Stevens, 1990) . Importantly, this did not lead to broad changes in gene expression (see below).

            "text": "Using the same TMT-LC/MS-MS strategy described above, we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from three biological replicates of Xrn1 knockout cells expressing muSOX or an empty vector control ( Figure 1A ). Comparison of these data to the list of proteins from Table S3 in Supplementary file 1 indicated that 45 of the 67 hits failed to shuttle in muSOX-expressing Xrn1 knockout cells, confirming that our workflow identified factors that differentially shuttle in response to mRNA degradation (Figure 2A ,B). Poly(A) tail degradation is normally carried out by deadenylases prior to activation of Xrn1-mediated decay from the 5' end, but we previously demonstrated that SOX-cleaved mRNAs are not deadenylated prior to their targeting by Xrn1 . Indeed, analysis of Xrn1 knockout leads to subcellular redistribution of proteins functionally associated with RNA Given that increased Xrn1 activity caused nuclear translocation of mRNA-associated RBPs, we hypothesized that RBPs linked to Xrn1 function might also exhibit altered subcellular distribution in cells lacking Xrn1. We first looked broadly for proteins with reproducibly altered abundance in the nucleus or the cytoplasm of Xrn1 knockout cells relative to the vector control cells. There were 149 and 158 proteins differentially expressed in the absence of Xrn1 in the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively (adjusted P value< 0.05) ( Figure 3A , Table S4 in Supplementary file 1). Both the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and RBPs were significantly overrepresented among the set of differentially expressed proteins in each compartment ( Figure 3A , Figure 3 -figure supplement 1A). The significance of the OST enrichment is currently unknown, although the OST complex has been shown to be critical for infection with flaviviruses, which depend on Xrn1 for the production of a subgenomic viral noncoding RNA (Chapman et al., 2014; Moon et al., 2012) . However, the RBP enrichment is in line with Xrn1 function, and it is notable that among the proteins significantly enriched in the nucleus of Xrn1 KO cells were factors that encompass the first steps of 5'\u00c03' mRNA decay. These included all members of the decapping complex (DCP1A, DCP1B and DCP2), factors that promote decapping complex formation (EDC3 and EDC4), and a protein that connects the decapping complex to the deadenylation machinery (PATL1) ( Figure 3B ). We next examined whether the absence of Xrn1 also impacted the relative abundance of its known interaction partners (as listed in the BioGRID database) in the two compartments ( Figure 3C ). This did not appear to be the case in the TMT data, as the majority of known Xrn1 protein partners were expressed at normal levels in the absence of Xrn1. However, there was a significant increase in the cytoplasmic levels of UPF1, a mediator of nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Similarly, DNASE2, a nuclease which contributes to the degradation of DNA in dying cells, had increased cytoplasmic abundance. Secernin-2 (SCRN2), a protein involved in exocytosis, translocated to the nucleus in the absence of Xrn1. Conversely, PABPC4 levels were decreased in both compartments, and two centrosomal proteins CEP152 and CEP128 were reduced in the nucleus.",

Alternatively, translocation could occur indirectly via interactions with other proteins that contain nuclear transport signals. To test for this latter possibility, we first plotted the network of known interactions among the list of proteins that relocalized in cells undergoing accelerated mRNA decay using the STRING database ( Figure 4A ). There were significantly more interactions among this set of proteins than would be predicted for a random group of proteins of similar size (p=0.0496), with many of the interactions involving PABPC. This enrichment suggests that these proteins are biologically related, confirming what was seen in the GO term analysis. We examined the relocalization mechanism for one of the PABPC interacting proteins, LARP4 (Yang et al., 2011) . We reasoned that if LARP4 relocalization involved direct interactions with the nuclear import machinery, then it should relocalize in muSOX-expressing cells in a PABPC independent manner. Conversely, if it was 'escorted' into the nucleus via its interaction with PABPC, then its relocalization should be blocked by PABPC depletion. Depletion of PABPC1 has been shown to lead to compensatory induction of PABPC4, which can function in a redundant manner (Kumar and Glaunsinger, 2010) . Therefore, we co-depleted both PABPC1 and PABPC4 using siRNAs. Upon co-depletion of the PABPC proteins, LARP4 no longer accumulated in the nucleus of muSOX-expressing cells ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of LARP4 had no effect on PABPC1 shuttling in these cells ( Figure 4C ). These results support a model in which LARP4 is brought into the nucleus in cells undergoing accelerated mRNA decay through its interaction with PABPC.",

            "text": "PABPC depletion abrogates the muSOX-driven decrease in RNAPII promoter occupancy Given the nuclear enrichment of many poly(A) and poly(U) associated proteins, we considered these factors to be strong candidates for involvement in the signaling pathway linking accelerated mRNA decay to RNAPII transcriptional repression. To determine if they were required for the mRNA decaytranscription feedback loop, we tested whether depletion of several of these factors individually altered RNAPII occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP). To test the role of PABPC we co-depleted both PABPC1 and PABPC4 using siRNAs, then monitored RNAPII occupancy at two cellular promoters (gapdh, rplp0) previously shown to be responsive to mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression . In cells depleted of PABPC1 and PABPC4, there was no longer a reduction in RNAPII occupancy at the gapdh and rplp0 promoters in muSOX expressing cells relative to vector control cells ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, RNAPII promoter occupancy remained repressed in muSOX expressing cells upon depletion of LARP4 ( Figure 5B ). In addition to poly(A) tail associated proteins, we tested the effects of depleting three additional factors that translocated to the nucleus in an mRNA-decay dependent manner: the poly(U) binding protein MSI1, the CHD3 transcriptional regulator, and one of the top scoring hits from the MS data, TRIM32 ( It should be noted that when we measured the effect of depleting the above factors on RNAPII occupancy in the absence of muSOX, we unexpectedly observed that their knockdown alone reduced the RNAPII ChIP signal ( Figure 5-figure supplement 2A-E) . However, unlike the case for PABPC, RNAPII levels were further reduced in muSOX expressing cells after depletion of LARP4, MSI1, CHD3, and TRIM32 ( Figure 5B , Figure 5 -figure supplement 1A-C). We hypothesize that knockdown of these factors may lead to broad impacts on cellular function, in ways that directly or indirectly influence transcription. Therefore, although PABPC appeared to be selectively involved in suppressing RNAPII occupancy during enhanced mRNA decay, we sought an alternative strategy to evaluate its connection to this process. Nuclear accumulation of PABPC1 is sufficient to inhibit RNAPII recruitment to promoters Endogenous PABPC is subject to translational autoregulation, and our previous data suggested that the abundance of PABPC in uninfected cells is fine-tuned to match poly(A) tail availability (Kumar and Glaunsinger, 2010; Kumar et al., 2011) . In this regard, even modest over-expression of PABPC1 leads to nuclear accumulation of the 'excess' (presumably non-poly(A) bound) protein in cells lacking muSOX ( Figure 5C ). This feature enabled us to test whether nuclear accumulation of PABPC1 was sufficient to cause a reduction in RNAPII promoter recruitment in the absence of muSOX-induced mRNA decay. Indeed, FLAG-PABPC1 transfected cells displayed a significant decrease in RNAPII occupancy at the gapdh and rplp0 promoters ( Figure 5D ). These observations suggested that the failure of muSOX to trigger transcriptional repression in Xrn1 knockout cells might be overcome by driving PABPC into the nucleus via overexpression. In agreement with this prediction, muSOX-induced transcriptional repression was restored in Xrn1 knockout cells upon transfection of FLAG-PABPC1, confirming that nuclear translocation of this RBP plays a central role in connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay to RNAPII promoter recruitment ( Figure 5E ).",

In each of the experiments below, we evaluated cells transfected with empty vector control, muSOX (to activate cytoplasmic mRNA decay), or FLAG-PABPC1 (to selectively increase nuclear PABPC levels in the absence of widespread mRNA decay). Cells expressing muSOX or FLAG-PABPC1 exhibited parallel phenotypes, in which RNAPII occupancy was reduced at promoters as well as within the gene body compared to control cells ( Figure 6A ). Western blotting confirmed that the reduced ChIP signals were not due to a decrease in the overall levels of RNAPII in these cells ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1) . The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNAPII Rpb1 subunit has unique phosphorylation patterns associated with each phase of transcription; it initially binds DNA in an unphosphorylated state, but undergoes progressive serine 5-phosphorylation (Ser5P) during initiation, then serine 2-phosphorylation (Ser2P) during elongation (Heidemann et al., 2013) . To determine whether mRNA decayinduced PABPC1 translocation impacted RNAPII initiation or elongation in addition to promoter recruitment, we measured the ratio of total RNAPII to either Ser5P or Ser2P RNAPII ( Figure 6B and C). In both muSOX and FLAG-PABPC expressing cells, these ratios were unchanged relative to control cells, suggesting that the primary defect is in promoter recruitment, and that there are not independent impacts on downstream events. These data are consistent with previous observations in MHV68-infected cells .",

The initial promoter-defining event in PIC assembly that occurs prior to RNAPII recruitment is binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) as part of the transcription factor TFIID complex, whose recruitment is essential for initiating transcription (Darzacq et al., 2007; Louder et al., 2016) . Notably, TBP ChIP revealed that its occupancy at the gapdh, actB, tlcd1, and rplp0 promoters was significantly reduced in cells expressing either muSOX or FLAG-PABPC1 compared to control cells ( Figure 6D ). Similar to RNAPII, western blotting confirmed that this reduction in promoter binding was not due to altered expression of TBP in these cells (Figure 6 -figure supplement 1). Given that TBP is a transcription factor required by cellular polymerases other than just RNAPII, we considered the possibility that all TBP-dependent transcription might be impaired as a consequence of cytoplasmic mRNA decay. This was not the case however, as 7SK and U6 promoter Figure 6 continued on next page occupancy by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII), which also requires TBP, was unaltered in cells expressing muSOX or FLAG-PABPC1 compared to control cells ( Figure 6E) . We therefore conclude that mRNA decay-driven nuclear accumulation of PABPC1 reduces PIC assembly selectively at the promoters of RNAPII transcribed genes.",

In addition to altering the translational landscape, depletion of cytoplasmic mRNA elicits changes in upstream components of the mammalian gene expression pathway, including RNAPII transcription, largely by unknown mechanisms . Here, we tested the hypothesis that cellular RNA binding proteins may shift their subcellular localization in response to altered mRNA decay, thus conveying mRNA abundance information between the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( Figure 6F ). Quantitative proteomics was previously reported to allow the discovery of viral infection-induced protein translocations (Jean Beltran et al., 2017) . Indeed, our unbiased TMT-based proteomics approach revealed that among the total cellular protein pool, an RBP-enriched protein subset concentrates in the nucleus specifically in response to increased mRNA decay in an Xrn1 dependent manner. RBPs have critical roles in all stages of gene expression (M\u00fcller-McNicoll and Neugebauer, 2013) , and our data further emphasize their multifunctional capacity.",

Interestingly, factors involved in decapping, the event that directly precedes Xrn1 attack during basal mRNA decay, were selectively increased in the nuclei of cells lacking Xrn1. Furthermore, we detected increased levels of the NMD factor UPF1 in the cytoplasm and overall elevated levels of GW182 in these cells. One speculative possibility is that these changes occur in response to cellular 'reprogramming' of the mRNA decay network, for example shifting emphasis towards 3' end targeting mechanisms to compensate for the absence of the primary 5' end decay mechanism. This scenario might explain the increase in GW182 levels, as it recruits the cellular deadenylase complexes PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT to mRNA targets to promote mRNA decay by Xrn1 (Braun et al., 2011; Chekulaeva et al., 2011; Fabian et al., 2011; Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011) . In its absence, the increased GW182 levels may accelerate deadenylation to instead promote 3'\u00c05' decay. Alternatively, the RBP nuclear and/or cytoplasmic enrichment in Xrn1 knockout cells may reflect changes that occur when the cytoplasmic mRNA decay rate is reduced. The fact that we did not observe significant redistribution of the majority of Xrn1 interacting proteins argues against a model in which physical association with Xrn1 helps control decay factor protein localization.",

This supports the hypothesis that this class of RBPs would be significantly impacted by the mRNA abundance and availability. PABPC nuclear translocation in particular has been well documented in the context of infection with viruses that drive mRNA decay (Bablanian et al., 1991; Borah et al., 2012; Harb et al., 2008; Lee and Glaunsinger, 2009; Park et al., 2014; Piron et al., 1998; Salaun et al., 2010) , and our unbiased proteomics approach establishes it as one of the most robustly relocalized RBPs under these conditions. Several features of PABPC render it an ideal indicator of mRNA abundance. First, its association with poly(A) tails implies that depletion of mRNAs but no other type of abundant non-polyadenylated RNAs should selectively alter the level of PABPC in the RNA bound versus unbound state. Second, nuclear import of PABPC is antagonized by cytoplasmic mRNA abundance. We previously reported that PABPC harbors noncanonical NLSs within its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs); upon poly(A) binding, these elements are masked and the protein is thus retained in the cytosol . However, release of PABPC from mRNA exposes the NLSs, enabling its interaction with importin a and its subsequent nuclear import. The observation that PABPC localization is directly influenced by mRNA abundance suggest that cells must carefully calibrate the ratio of PABPC to mRNA. Indeed, PABPC protein binds an autoregulatory A-rich sequence in the 5'UTR of its own mRNA to disrupt 40S ribosomal scanning and reduce its translation (de Melo Neto et al., 1995; Wu and Bag, 1998) .",

However, when concentrated in the nucleus, PABPC functions instead to restrict gene expression. One previously established mechanism by which gene expression is inhibited involves disruption of mRNA processing, where PABPC drives hyperadenylation of nascent mRNAs (Kumar and Glaunsinger, 2010) . In this study, we reveal that nuclear accumulation of PABPC phenotypically mimics muSOX-dependent repression of RNAPII promoter binding; it appears necessary and sufficient to repress RNAPII promoter recruitment as a consequence of accelerated mRNA decay. Both muSOX and FLAG-PABPC1 expression target early stages of PIC assembly, as TBP and RNAPII occupancy are reduced at promoters. Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae nuclear poly(A) binding protein Nab2 has been shown to potentiate RNAPIII activity by directly binding RNAPIII and stabilizing TFIIIB with promoter DNA (Reuter et al., 2015) , providing a precedent for PABPs influencing transcription. However, although TBP is required for the activity of other polymerases including RNAPIII, we found that the impact of mRNA decay-induced PABPC translocation appears specific to RNAPII responsive promoters. Furthermore, while RNAPII levels are reduced at both promoters and in the gene body, the residual promoter-bound population of RNAPII does not appear to have additional defects in promoter escape or elongation, as measured by polymerase CTD phosphorylation patterns. Collectively, these observations suggest that altered PABPC trafficking primarily impacts the very earliest stages of PIC assembly. Determining which factors govern the specificity for RNAPII responsive promoters during accelerated mRNA decay and their connection to nuclear PABPC remain important challenges for the future.",

            "text": "Although we did not detect a role for LARP4, MSI1, CHD3, or TRIM32 in muSOX-induced transcriptional repression, these findings are complicated by the observation that their depletion alone impaired RNAPII recruitment. In our hands, this phenotype is common to the depletion of a number of different RBPs (though not all), suggesting that their absence may cause secondary effects on gene expression. This also underscores the importance of using alternative assays to evaluate their contributions, as we did for PABPC. Interestingly, some of these proteins are likely to engage in distinct gene regulatory functions in the nucleus that could also be impacted by their altered nuclearcytoplasmic trafficking. For example, a nuclear role for MSI1 has recently been uncovered during mouse spermatogenesis, when it translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Sutherland et al., 2015) . In the cytoplasm, MSI1 negatively regulates the translation of its target RNAs by competing with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G for binding to PABPC (Kawahara et al., 2008) . However, upon spermatocyte differentiation, MSI1 relocalizes to the nucleus through direct interaction with importin-5 (IPO5), where it concentrates at the silent XY chromatin domain. This not only releases its repression on translation, but also alters its repertoire of RNA targets in the nucleus. LARP4 also binds PABPC, but unlike MSI1, this interaction promotes mRNA poly(A) tail lengthening and stabilization in the cytoplasm (Yang et al., 2011) . Our findings suggest that nuclear accumulation of LARP4 is also dependent on its interaction with PABPC. LARP4 protein levels are controlled posttranscriptionally via an instability determinant within its coding sequence, suggesting that akin to PABPC, its protein abundance is tightly regulated (Mattijssen et al., 2017) . The functions of LARP4 in the nucleus, as well as other RBPs identified in this work, are currently unknown. Exploring these roles and how they become manipulated during times of cellular stress are areas ripe for future studies.",

However, one key difference between this pathway in yeast and mammalian cells is that in yeast it appears to operate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain optimal mRNA abundance: reduced mRNA decay results in reduced transcription, and vice versa (Haimovich et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013) . This potentially represents an evolutionary divergence in which a unicellular eukaryote 'buffers' its overall gene expression for continued maintenance of the organism. In multicellular eukaryotes like mammals, global mRNA decay (which is induced by numerous pathogens) may instead serve as a stress signal, and the ensuing response is thus geared towards shutdown of major cellular programs.

The nuclear channels (126 -128C) and cytoplasmic channels (129 N-131) were analyzed in separate Proteome Discoverer studies to not bias the quantitation due to the expected protein expression differences between these two compartments. The Spectrum Files RC node was utilized to perform postacquisition mass recalibration and the recalibrated spectra were passed to Sequest HT where two successive rounds of searching were employed against a Uniprot human database appended with common contaminants (2016 -04, 22,349 sequences). Both search rounds required 5ppm accuracy on the precursor and 0.02 Da accuracy on the fragments and included static carbamidomethyl modifications to cysteine, static TMT additions to peptide N-termini and lysine residues, dynamic oxidation of methionine, dynamic deamidation of asparagine, and dynamic methionine loss and acetylation of protein n-termini. The first Sequest HT search was for fully tryptic peptides only and any unmatched spectra were sent to a second Sequest HT search, which allowed semi-tryptic peptide matches. All matched spectra were scored by Percolator and reporter ion signal-to-noise (S/N) values were extracted . The resulting peptide spectrum matches were parsimoniously assembled into a set of identified peptide and protein identifications with a false discovery rate of less than 1% for both the peptide and protein level and at least two unique peptides identified per protein. TMT reporter ion quantification was performed for unique and razor peptides with an average S/N of at least 10 and a precursor co-isolation threshold of less than 30% which did not contain a variable modification. Reporter ion values were normalized to the total detected signal in each channel and protein abundances were calculated as the sum of all normalized reporter ion values for each channel in each protein. Missing values were input using the low abundance resampling algorithm. The reporter ion values for the empty vector WT samples (channels 126 and 129N) were set as 100 and the other channels were scaled to this value. Statistically differential proteins were assessed via a background based ANOVA analysis implemented in Proteome Discoverer. Proteins and associated TMT reporter ion abundances and adjusted p-values from the ANOVA analysis were exported to Excel for further analysis.

Crosslinked cell pellets were mixed with 1 ml ice-cold ChIP lysis buffer (5 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min, whereupon the lysate was dounce homogenized to release nuclei and spun at 1.5 x g for 5 min at 4\u02daC. Nuclei were then resuspended in 500 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.3% SDS, 10 mM EDTA) and rotated for 10 min at 4\u02daC followed by sonication using a QSonica Ultrasonicator with a cup horn set to 75 amps for 20 min total (5 min on, 5 min off).
