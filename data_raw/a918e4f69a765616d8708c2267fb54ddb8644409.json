Methods: The study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, temporal distribution, population history and clinical symptoms of betacoronavirus infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,060 adults presented with acute respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of betacoronaviruses using multiplex PCR. The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. Results: A total of 48/2060 (2.4 %) specimens were tested positive for HCoV-OC43 (1.3 %) and HCoV-HKU1 (1.1 %). Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were co-circulating throughout the year, with the lowest detection rates reported in the October-January period. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene showed that the majority of HCoV-OC43 isolates were grouped into two previously undefined genotypes, provisionally assigned as novel lineage 1 and novel lineage 2. Sign of natural recombination was observed in these potentially novel lineages. Location mapping showed that the novel lineage 1 is currently circulating in Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and China, while novel lineage 2 can be found in Malaysia and China. Molecular dating showed the origin of HCoV-OC43 around late 1950s, before it diverged into genotypes A (1960s), B (1990s), and other genotypes (2000s). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 27.3 % of the HCoV-HKU1 strains belong to genotype A while 72.7 % belongs to genotype B. The tree root of HCoV-HKU1 was similar to that of HCoV-OC43, with the tMRCA of genotypes A and B estimated around the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Correlation of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 with the severity of respiratory symptoms was not observed. Conclusions: The present study reported the molecular complexity and evolutionary dynamics of human betacoronaviruses among adults with acute respiratory symptoms in a tropical country. Two novel HCoV-OC43 genetic lineages were identified, warranting further investigation on their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses are common cold viruses that are frequently found to be associated with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [1] . According to the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) belong to the betacoronavirus genus, a member of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses contain the largest RNA genomes and have been established as one of the rapidly evolving viruses [2] . In addition to the high nucleotide substitution rates across the genome [3] , the coronavirus genome is subjected to homologous recombination during viral replication, which is caused by RNA template switching mediated by the copy-choice mechanism [4, 5] . The genetic recombination of coronaviruses had possibly led to the emergence of lethal pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused up to 50 % mortality in infected individuals [6] [7] [8] [9] . Recombination events in the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within the 1a gene of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 leading to the emergence of unique recombinant genotypes have been reported [10, 11] .",

In humans, acute upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are relatively common in HCoV infections while sore throat and hoarseness of voice are less common, with cough usually associated with HCoV-OC43 infection [14] . In tropical countries, annual shift in the predominant genotype has been documented, with more cases of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections reported during the early months of the year [15] . Despite the clinical importance and socioeconomic impact of HCoV infections [16, 17] , the prevalence, seasonality, clinical and phylogenetic characteristics of HCoVs remain largely unreported in the tropical region of Southeast Asia. Based on the S, N and 1a genes of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 isolated from Malaysia and also globally, we attempted to delineate the genetic history and the phylodynamic profiles of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 using a suite of Bayesian phylogenetic tools. We also reported the emergence of two novel HCoV-OC43 lineages, in a crosssectional study of patients presented with acute URTI in Malaysia.",

The PCR mixture (25 \u03bcl) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl, 0.01 % gelatin), 100 \u03bcM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, Hi-Spec Additive and 4u/\u03bcl BIO-X-ACT Short DNA polymerase (BioLine, USA). The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 54.5\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min, performed in a C1000 Touch automated thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). Nested/seminested PCR was conducted for each genetic region if necessary, under the same cycling conditions at 30 cycles. Purified PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The nucleotide sequences were codonaligned with previously described complete and partial HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank [11, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

MCC trees were generated using a relaxed molecular clock, assuming uncorrelated lognormal distribution under the general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + I) and a constant coalescent tree model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run was set at 3 \u00d7 10 6 steps long sampled every 10,000 state. The trees were annotated using Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package, after a 10 % burn-in, and visualized in FigureTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/Figuretree/). Neighbor joining (NJ) trees for the partial S (S1 domain), complete N and partial 1a (nsp3) genes were also reconstructed, using Kimura 2-parameter model in MEGA 5.1 [35] . The reliability of the branching order was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. In addition, to explore the genetic relatedness between HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genotypes, the pairwise genetic distances among sequences of the S gene were estimated. Inter-and intragenotype nucleotide distances were estimated by the bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates using MEGA 5.1. Such analysis has not been done for the N and the 1a genes because those regions were highly conserved across genotypes [10, 11, 32] . To test for the presence of recombination in HCoV-OC43, the S gene was subjected to pairwise distance-based bootscanning analysis using SimPlot version 3.5 [10, 36] . Established reference genomes for HCoV-OC43 genotype A (ATCC VR-759), B (87309 Belgium 2003), and C (HK04-01) were used as putative parental lineages, with a sliding window and step size of 160 bp and 20 bp, respectively. In addition, MaxChi recombination test [37] was performed in the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 4.0 [38] . In RDP the highest acceptable p value (the probability that sequences could share high identities in potentially recombinant regions by chance alone) was set at 0.05, with the standard multiple comparisons corrected using the sequential Bonferroni method with 1,000 permutations [39] .",

Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the S gene, one subject (1/23, 4.3 %) was grouped with HCoV-OC43 genotype B reference sequences while another subject (1/23, 4.3 %) was grouped with HCoV-OC43 genotype D sequences. The remaining 21 isolates formed two phylogenetically discrete clades that were distinct from other previously established genotypes A, B, C, D (genotype D is a recombinant lineage that is not readily distinguished from genotype C in the S and N phylogenetic trees) and E [11, 32] (Fig. 2 and Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Of the 21 isolates, ten isolates have formed a cluster with other recently reported isolates from Japan, Thailand and China [31, 32] supported by the posterior probability value of 1.0 and bootstrap value of 36 % at the internal tree node of the MCC and NJ trees, respectively with intra-group pairwise genetic distance of 0.003 \u00b1 0.001. These isolates were provisionally designated as novel lineage 1. Spatial structure was observed within novel lineage 1, with an isolate from China sampled in year 2008 located at the base of the phylogeny. Moreover, another eleven HCoV-OC43 isolates have formed a second distinct cluster supported by significant posterior probability and bootstrap values at the internal tree node (1.0 and 98 %, respectively) and intra-group pairwise genetic distance of 0.004 \u00b1 0.001. The cluster contained Malaysian and Chinese isolates [32] only, and was denoted as novel lineage 2. Based on the phylogenetic inference of the conserved N gene, only one subject was grouped with the genotype B reference in concordance with the S gene (Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). Unlike the phylogenetic inference of the S gene, the remaining 22 isolates were seen intermingled with each other forming a single cluster together with isolates indicated as novel lineages 1 and 2 in the S gene, in addition to one genotype D strain. It is however important to note that the tree resolution was poor, due primarily to the lack of the N gene reference sequences in the public database.",

In addition, phylogenetic trees of previously described complete and partial S gene sequences as well as partial 1a (nsp3) and complete RdRp gene sequences were reconstructed to further confirm the reliability of the partial S1 and nsp3 for identification of HCoV-OC43 genotypes (Additional file 4: Figure S4 and Additional file 5: Figure S5 ). To assess the diversity between HCoV-OC43 genotypes, inter-genotype pairwise genetic distance was estimated for the S gene, listed in Table 3 . Using the oldest genotype as reference i.e. genotype A, genetic variation between genotype A and genotypes B to E was 2.2-2.7 %. Genetic distance between novel lineages 1 and 2 compared to genotype A was 3.2 % and 3.1 %, respectively, higher than that of other established genotypes.

Moreover, the common ancestor of HCoV-HKU1 was traced back to early 1950s, as estimated from the S gene. Subsequently, HCoV-HKU1 continued to diverge further into distinctive genotypes (A-C). Genotype A was dated to the late 1990 and genotypes B and C were both traced back to early 2000s (Fig. 3) . Bayes factor analysis showed insignificant differences (Bayes factor <3.0) between the constant and exponential coalescent models of demographic analysis.

These estimates corroborate with the previously reported average incidence of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 at 0.2-4.3 % and 0.3-4.4 %, respectively [12, 15, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Although HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are not as common as other respiratory viruses, several studies have reported an elevated incidence of HCoV-OC43 (up to 67 %) due to sporadic outbreaks with fatality rate up to 8 % [46, 47] . This 12-month study showed that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections were frequently detected during March 2012 to September 2012 and decreased thereafter, in line with findings reported from other tropical Southeast Asian country [15] . However, such patterns differ from that in temperate areas where the prevalence peaks during winter seasons, but few or no detections in the summer [43] . It is also important to note that the study was performed in a relatively short duration, therefore limiting the epidemiological and disease trend comparison with reports from other countries. Phylogenetic inference based on the S gene of HCoV-OC43 suggested the emergence of two potentially novel genotypes (designated as novel lineage 1 and novel lineage 2), supported by phylogenetic evidence and shared recombination structures. The relatively low mean intra-cluster genetic variation reflects the high intra-genotype genetic homogeneity of each novel lineage. Inter-genotype genetic distances between HCoV-OC43 genotypes further supported that the novel lineages 1 and 2 are distinct from the previously described genotypes [11, 17, 32] in which the genetic distances between each of these two genotypes and the others were notably high (up to 3.2 %) ( Table 3) . Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that novel lineage 1 includes isolates from Malaysia, Thailand, China and Japan while novel lineage 2 isolates are all from Malaysia and China. Spatiotemporal characteristic In order to clearly define the genetic characteristic of the putative novel lineages 1 and 2 (and also any other isolates with discordant phylogenetic patterns), complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis need to be carried out. Based on the newly estimated substitution rates, the divergence times for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were phylogenetically inferred. Interestingly, although HCoV-OC43 was the first human coronavirus discovered in 1965 [48, 49] , and the HCoV-HKU1 was first described much later in 2005 [50] , the S gene analysis of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 revealed that the respective common ancestors of both viruses have emerged since 1950s. Furthermore, the divergence times of HCoV-OC43 genotypes predicted in this study are comparable to those described in previous studies [11, 27] . Phylogenetic, recombination and molecular clock analysis suggest the emergence of novel lineages 1 and 2 around the mid-2000s and late 2000s, respectively, probably by natural recombination events involving genotypes B and C (for lineage 1) and genotypes A and B (for lineage 2).",
