            "text": "Background: Recent, severe outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Asia and North America highlight the need for well-validated diagnostic tests for the identification of PEDV infected animals and evaluation of their immune status to this virus. PEDV was first detected in the U.S. in May 2013 and spread rapidly across the country. Some serological assays for PEDV have been previously described, but few were readily available in the U.S. Several U.S. laboratories quickly developed indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays for the detection of antibodies to PEDV in swine serum, indicating prior exposure. However, the IFA has several disadvantages, including low throughput and relatively subjective interpretation. Different serologic test formats have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the questions being asked, so a full repertoire of tests is useful. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate multiple improved serological assays for PEDV, including an indirect ELISA (iELISA); a highly specific monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA); fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) that can be multiplexed to monitor exposure to multiple antigens and pathogens simultaneously; and a fluorescent focus neutralization assay (FFN) to measure functional virus neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "Results: A recombinant North American nucleoprotein (NP) based iELISA was developed and validated along with a bELISA using newly developed PEDV-NP specific biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and an FMIA using magnetic beads coupled with expressed NA PEDV-NP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using swine serum samples (iELISA n = 1486, bELISA n = 1186, FMIA n = 1420). The ROC analysis for the FMIA showed estimated sensitivity and specificity of 98.2 and 99.2 %, respectively. The iELISA and bELISA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 97.6 %; and 98.2 and 98.9 %, respectively. Inter-rater (kappa) agreement was calculated to be 0.941 between iELISA and IFA, 0.945 between bELISA and IFA and 0.932 between FMIA and IFA. Similar comparative kappa values were observed between the iELISA, bELISA and FMIA, which demonstrated a significant level of testing agreement among the three assays. No cross-reactivity with the closely related coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was noted with these assays. All three assays detected seroconversion of na\u00efve animals within 6-9 days post exposure. The FFN assay allows relative quantitation of functional neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. Conclusion: Well-validated iELISA, bELISA and FMIA assays for the detection of PEDV antibodies were developed and showed good correlation with IFA and each other. Each assay format has advantages that dictate how they will be used in the field. Newly developed mAbs to the PEDV-NP were used in the bELISA and for expediting FFN testing in the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, these PEDV mAbs are useful for immunohistochemistry, fluorescent antibody staining and other antigen-based tests. Measurement of neutralizing antibody responses using the FFN assay may provide a valuable tool for assessment of vaccine candidates or protective immunity.",

The virus was identified in the United States in May 2013, causing severe diarrhea and vomiting in pigs across age groups, with high mortality of up to 90 \u221295 % in suckling pigs [3] . PEDV is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. The coronaviruses taxonomically form a subfamily (Coronavirinae) within the order Nidovirales. Recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized four genera within the Coronavirinae subfamily: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [4] . PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus along with other swine viruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV).",

Sequence comparison with other European and Korean PEDV strains obtained from GenBank indicated that the NP genes were highly conserved (94.7\u221297.7 %) even though these strains originated from different geographic regions [5] . In addition to being highly conserved among PEDV variants, the NP is the most abundant viral protein expressed in PEDV infected cells [12, 13] . In contrast, the spike protein is presented on the viral surface and subject to various host immune pressures, which predisposes it to a greater range of genetic heterogeneity including insertions and deletions. Because the NP protein is highly abundant in virus infected cells, it provides an attractive target for the development of antigen-based serological assays. Taken together, this evidence provided rationale for using it as our antigen of choice for the iELISA, bELISA and FMIA.",

These assays provide an important tool in control of the virus; however, well-validated, high-throughput assays to detect antibodies following infection would provide additional valuable diagnostic tools for the swine industry. The ability to detect and evaluate antibody responses using serologic tests is important in efforts to answer basic production related questions. These questions may include whether a production site is na\u00efve or has historically experienced a PEDV exposure, even though a producer has not seen obvious clinical signs; the level of immune response sows may have in relation to vaccination, initial wildtype virus infection or intentional feedback exposure; and whether sow immunity is inadequate when clinical infection occurs in individual litters after initial PEDV exposure in a herd.",

However, few assays have been developed using antigens associated with contemporary strains currently circulating across NA. The need to develop more sensitive serological assays has become paramount in order to address questions regarding PEDV infections and epidemiological transmission patterns, as well as to analyze disease progression. Currently, serum virus neutralization (SVN) tests are the most widely employed serological assays used to detect PEDV antibodies. It is a test that is highly specific and useful for screening of antibody titer post vaccination [1, 16] . However, the test is expensive and labor intensive, requiring manual reading and interpretation of virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE) endpoints.

It was subsequently directionally cloned into the E. coli, pET 28a(+), plasmid expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), then transformed into BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RP competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for protein expression. Primers used for the amplification of the full length (1323 bp) nucleoprotein were: PEDV-NP-fwd (5\u2032-CG CGGATCCATGGCTTCTGTCAGTTTTCAG-3\u2032); PED V-NP-rev (5\u2032-CACACTCGAGATTTCCTGTGTCGAA GATCTC-3\u2032). Next, 20 \u03bcl of transformed cells were plated onto Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 50 \u03bcg of kanamycin/ml and incubated overnight. The following morning, colonies from the agar plates were added to 1 L of pre-warmed 2X yeast extract tryptone (YT) culture medium containing 50 \u03bcg kanamycin/ml and allowed to grow to an OD 600 of 0.5 at 37\u00b0C.

The agar was strained out and bacteria pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer solution (B-PER, Pierce, Rockford, IL), incubated for 15 min at 20-22\u00b0C, then centrifuged at 12,000 g to separate the soluble from insoluble proteins. The PEDV-NP recombinant protein was expressed as insoluble periplasmic inclusion bodies. The resulting 441 amino acid recombinant protein was denatured using 8 M urea, subsequently purified three times using nickel-NTA affinity column chromatography and refolded back to its native conformational state. Individual affinity column elutions were collected, pooled and confirmed by SDS-PAGE, then aliquoted/frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. The correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequence and restriction endonuclease analysis. The average protein yield produced by the pET28a-PEDV-NP plasmid construct was calculated to be 11 mg PEDV-NP per liter of 2XYT under the aforementioned conditions. The recombinant protein was detected and a predicted molecular weight of 51 kDa was confirmed via Western Blotting using convalescent sera, a 6X histidinespecific mAb (Novagen, Madison, WI) and a PEDV-NP specific mAb (Figs. 1 and 2).",

The optimal dilution of the recombinant protein and secondary detection antibody was determined by a checkerboard titration that gave the highest signal to noise ratio. In addition, a single lot of pooled convalescent serum from PEDV infected pigs was used to generate quality control standards that gave high and low optical density (high OD = 2.0 to 2.5; low OD = 0.5 to 1.0; and negative OD < 0.2).

Odd-numbered columns were coated with 100 \u03bcl of ACB plus antigen, while the evennumbered columns were coated with ACB without antigen, serving as background control. The plates were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C, then washed 3X with PBS plus 0.05 % tween 20 (PBST). Each well was then blocked with 200 \u03bcl of sample milk diluent (PBST plus 5 % nonfat dry milk, (SMD)) and allowed to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, the plates were washed 3X with 300 \u03bcl of PBST. Test and control sera were diluted 1/50 in SMD, mixed, and 100 \u03bcl of the solution was added to each well.

Alternate wells of each plate were coated with 500 ng per well of expressed PEDV-NP antigen. The optimal dilution of the recombinant protein and mAb antibody was determined by a checkerboard titration that gave the highest signal to noise ratio with an OD reading of approximately 2.0, in the absence of swine serum/competitor antibody. First, PEDV-NP recombinant protein was diluted to 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of ACB. Odd-numbered columns were coated with 100 \u03bcl of ACB plus antigen, while the even-numbered columns were coated with ACB without antigen serving as background control. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, washed 3 times with PBST, then placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. The following day, each well was blocked with 300 \u03bcl of SMD and incubated one hour at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBST, and 100 \u03bcl of test and control sera were diluted 1/3 with PBST + 0.1 % nonfat dry milk and added to each of the duplicate wells. Plates were incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. During sample incubation, PEDV-NP specific biotinylated, mAbs (SD6-29 and SD17-103) were adjusted to equal titers and mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. Next, 100 \u03bcl of a 1:40,000 dilution of the antibody detection mixture was added to the microtiter plate containing the competitive swine antibody, then swirled and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed 3 times, and 100 \u03bcl of high sensitivity, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to all wells of the microtiter plate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 4 times with PBST, and 100 \u03bcl of TMB was added to all wells and gently swirled. After ap-proximately15 min, color development progressed until the negative control attained a standard OD of approximately 2.0 and was subsequently stopped using 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Colorimetric development was quantified spectrophotometrically at 450 nm with an ELx800 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) controlled by XCheck software (Idexx Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). The raw data was normalized and transformed into a Excel spreadsheet, and the percent inhibition (PI) ratio was calculated using the following formula: PI = 1-{(OD of sample -OD of buffer)/(OD of negative control -OD of buffer)} X 100.",

The virus causes severe gastroenteritis, destroying villus enterocytes in pigs of all ages, and is characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, leading to subsequent dehydration, high mortality rates and economic losses, particularly in nursery piglets [3, 32] . A variety of serological tests have been developed against PEDV, but they vary by antigen used and in the degree of validation. In addition, few have used North American NP based antigens or compared the array of serologic assays described here. In the current study, four tests (IFA, bELISA, iELISA, FMIA) showed strong correlation. Each has advantages, which dictate how they will be used in the field. In addition, newly developed NP mAbs were used in the bELISA and for expediting FFN testing in the detection of neutralizing antibodies.",

Several authors confirm that the NP carries multiple antigenic determinants that are conserved among the Coronaviridae [33, 34] . However, we performed one-way cross-reactivity testing using serum from TGEV and PRCV, and no antibody crossreactivity was detected within any of our assays. In addition to being highly conserved among various PEDV variants, the NP is the most abundant viral protein expressed in PEDV infected cells, making it an attractive target antigen [12, 13] . Using Western blotting experiments, we confirmed the finding of Hou et al.

Blocking or competitive ELISAs have been constructed using monoclonal antibodies in PEDV serodiagnosis, and the specific methodology can affect the overall specificity and performance of the assay. Our method was based upon coating plates with highly purified NA PEDV-NP, then using a combination of two separate NA, anti-PEDV-NP specific, biotinylated, monoclonal antibodies as the blocking/competitive detection step. This allows the capture of anti-NP antibodies at higher quantities and those with a greater range of antigen specificities. The analytical specificity of the NP-based bELISA is also dependent on the affinity of the mAbs used. The antibodies used in this study are directed against conserved epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein without any evidence of cross-reactivity to any other genera of Alphacoronavirus tested. A previous assessment of antigenic cross-reactivity was performed using these same mAbs against different strains of PEDV and TGEV [7] . In that study, the authors reported that both mAbs used in the bELISA reacted with all PEDV strains tested, namely the homologous US isolate PC22A and the heterologous strains S INDEL IOWA 106, S 197DEL PC177 and CV777, at similar titers. Neither of the PEDV-NP mAbs cross-reacted with either the TGEV Miller or Purdue strains. Not only were the bELISA mAbs tested for heterologous cross-reactivity, but all three diagnostic platforms were evaluated in their ability to capture antibody against TGEV and PRCV, and there was no cross-reactivity to either heterologous virus.",

            "text": "Serology testing with IFA, iELISA, bELISA or FMIA is useful in determining whether pigs were previously infected with PEDV, or if piglets have acquired antibodies through colostrum (eg. passive antibody transfer). However, tests that evaluate the functionality of the antibodies such as the FFN are needed to determine if the detected immune response could be helpful in providing protection to nursing piglets. Neutralizing antibodies may be protective through actions including blocking uptake of the virus into cells, preventing virus binding to receptors on cells, preventing uncoating of the virus genomes in endosomes and/or causing aggregation of virus particles. For enveloped viruses, such as PEDV, lysis of the virus may also occur when antiviral antibodies and serum complement disrupt the viral membrane. For these reasons, an FFN-based virus neutralization assay was developed to assess levels of PEDV neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. The FFN provides a more rapid determination of neutralizing antibody levels than is possible with traditional virus neutralization assays that rely on visualization of virusinduced CPE after three or more days incubation to allow for full development of PEDV CPE. The direct observation of fluorescent stained infected cells, or lack of stained infected cells in the case of virus neutralization, allows for simple endpoint determination. This feature is particularly valuable when dealing with a fastidious, trypsin-dependent virus such as PEDV where CPE-based endpoints may not be obvious or may be confused with trypsin-induced CPE in the cell monolayer. Although neutralizing antibodies present in the serum would not be expected to provide direct protection from a strictly enteric infection such as PEDV, our data suggest a correlation between detectable neutralizing antibody levels in the serum and those present in milk and colostrum of previously exposed or vaccinated sows.",

Therefore, there is a shorter diffusion path to antibody binding sites on the antigen coated beads resulting in rapid reaction times. Instead of a method using an enzymatic reaction such as with the ELISA, the FMIA detection is with laser technology, which results in a shorter detection time. This PEDV antigen specific bead set can be \"mixed\" with additional coated beads to other antigens, such as SIV, PCV2, PRRSV or other pathogens, for simultaneous detection of antibodies to these antigens.
