Most patients die of progressive respiratory failure that is believed to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 7] . ARDS is a common, devastating clinical syndrome of acute lung injury with high mortality ranging from 40% to 60% [8, 9] . Pathological findings show that 64% of ARDS patients may have pulmonary fibrosis (PF) during convalescence [10] . Owing to the damage of architecture and loss of functional capillary units of the lung, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in human can lead to respiratory failure within a few years following diagnostic confirmation, and may correlate with an increased risk of death [11] . PF results as a consequence of many types of severe lung injury and is almost always associated with an inflammatory reaction [12, 13] . Some virus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus, can induce the typical ARDS and PF, and most patients eventually die [14, 15] . Also, it is possible that patients infected with H5N1 viruses may suffer from PF as a result of ARDS.",

Laboratory animal can provide considerable insight into the pathogenesis of the complex process of fibrosis in the lung.

The isolate was designated as A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002 (H5N1) (Chicken/HB/108). The complete genome sequences (DQ343152, DQ349116, DQ351860, DQ351861, DQ351866, DQ351867, DQ351872, and DQ351873) of the virus can be obtained from GenBank. The virus caused 100% (8 of 8) mortality of 4-wk-old spe-cific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken within 2 days after intravenous infection with 0.2 ml of infectious allantoic fluid at 1:10 dilution. This virus belongs to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, according to the criteria of viral virulence [17] . Our previous studies showed that this virus was highly lethal to mice and could cause typical ARDS in mice [16] . The virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs at 37\u00b0C for 32 h, and third-passage virus was gradient purified and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. All manipulations of live viruses were conducted in biosafety level 3+ (BSL-3+) facilities.",

H5N1infected group of 50 mice was inoculated with H5N1 virus, and control group of 20 mice received the noninfectious allantoic fluid, as described above. The animals' general behavior and clinical signs, including the food intake, body weight, inactivity, anal temperature (measured with an infrared thermometer) and mortality were monitored daily in each group for 30 days. To observe the food intake, the mice were housed individually, on grids in boxes which were changed twice/week. They were weighed daily and their food intake was measured by offering daily known weights of food and separating and weighing any leftover food in the box at each change.

The severity of PF was assessed. All of the specimens were numbered randomly and interpreted by an experimenter blinded to the experimental conditions. Visual grading of PF was performed by determining the Ashcroft's score, with some modification [18, 19] . Briefly, the entire fields of each lung section were scanned under an Olympus microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.) at a magnification of \u00d7 100, and each field was visually graded from 0 to 8. Criteria for grading lung fibrosis were as follows: Grade 0 = normal lung; Grade 1 = minimal fibrous thickening of alveolar or bronchiolar walls; Grade 3 = moderate thickening of walls without obvious damage to lung architecture; Grade 5 = increased fibrosis with definite damage to lung structure and formation of fibrous bands or small fibrous masses; Grade 7 = severe distortion of structure and large fibrous areas; Grade 8 = total fibrous obliteration of lung fields. After examination of the whole sections, the mean score of all the fields was taken as the fibrosis score for each animal. The lung fibrosis severity in the mice survived on day 30 p.i. was further classified into 4 grades (from no obvious fibrosis to severe fibrosis) according to fibrosis score ranges as shown in Table 1 .",

Briefly, lung tissues samples from mice were weighed and hydrolyzed to release hydroxyproline from collagen. Oxidation of the hydroxyproline with chloramines T and the hydroxyproline chromogen was reacted with paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde to develop a pink color. Absorbance of colored products was measured at 550 nm spectrophotometrically and the hydroxyproline contents of samples were calculated by comparing with the standards.

At the acute stage, the onset and evolution of clinical signs were as follows: on day 3 p.i., slight altered gait, inactivity, ruffled fur, inappetence and weight loss; at days 6 to 8 p.i., more severe inappetence, emaciation, and the visual signs of labored respirations and respiratory distress. Fifty-six percent (28 of 50) of H5N1-infected mice died during this stage, with death peak between days 7 and 8 p.i. The onset of inappetence and inactivity was correlated with loss of body weight, which continued to decline until death. The body temperature slightly declined during the H5N1 infection, and dramatically declined before the mice died. At the restoration stage, the clinical signs in most survived animals resolved gradually on days 9 to 14 p.i., and disappeared almost completely at days 15 to 30. However, 18% (4 of 22) of H5N1-infected mice survived the acute stage but developed late stage disease acceleration as assessed by the presence of inactivity, weight loss, inappetence and emaciation. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations showed that these mice presented severe PF. Figure 1 shows the changes of body weight and food intake after H5N1 viral infection. The H5N1 infection in mice induced an acute reduction in body weight on days 2 to 8 p.i., and caused a greater decrease in body weight gain on days 10 to 30 p.i. The standard deviations for body weights in infected mice were much greater than those in control mice during the restoration period (on days 10 to 30), indicating the individual differences in the same group. The similar change was also observed in food intake. These data suggested that the survived mice compromised the quality of life over a 30-d time period after viral infection.",

In this study, lung hydroxyproline contents, as shown in Figure 4 , were measured at days 7, 14, and 30 p.i. On day 7 p.i., H5N1 group showed a significant decrease of the lung hydroxyproline contents compared with control animals, which might reflect the development of severe lung edema in infected mice. The lung hydroxyproline levels returned to normal on day 14 p.i., and increased by almost two-fold on day 30 p.i. compared with that in control mice. The change of hydroxyproline contents was consistent with our histopathological findings which demonstrated the formation of PF on day 30 after infection. Figure 5 shows the effect of H5N1 viral infection on lung wet-to-dry weight ratios and dry lung-to-body weight ratios. In H5N1-infected mice, two ratios did not change obviously on day 3 p.i., but dramatically elevated on day 7 p.i., suggesting the severe edema and inflammatory exudates of the lung. Both ratios of infected mice returned to control levels on day 14 p.i., indicating that edema and inflammatory exudates had been reabsorbed. On day 30 p.i., the survived mice showed the significantly decreased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios but dramatically increased dry lung-to-body weight ratios, which might be associated with the formation of PF in H5N1-infected mice.

PF is difficult to treat clinically and few drugs can be useful. Corticosteroid therapy like dexamethasone is the current first-line choice to prevent this disease because of its anti-inflammatory effects [25] .
