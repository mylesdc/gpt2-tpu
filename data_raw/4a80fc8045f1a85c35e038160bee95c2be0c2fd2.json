            "text": "Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a lethal infectious disease in suckling piglets with symptoms including watery diarrhea caused by PED virus (PEDV). Since the late 1990's, live vaccines based on genogroup 1 virus have been used in Japan, and a significant amount of the vaccine has been used even after new genogroups invaded in 2013. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a conventional PED live vaccine on a newly prevalent genogroup 2 field strain in experimental and field situations. Methods: Two pregnant sows were administered twice the live vaccine before farrowing. A pregnant sow was served as a negative control. All newborn piglets were challenged with the genogroup 2 virus, and clinical signs were monitored for 7 days post challenge. PEDV-specific immune responses in serum and milk of the sows were assayed by virus neutralization assay. The efficacy of PED live vaccine in vaccinated or non-vaccinated farms was evaluated by comparing the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED. Results: The challenged piglets exhibited watery diarrhea with or without vaccination. However, the clinical score of piglets born from vaccinated sows significantly improved after the 4th day of the challenge. The survival rate of piglets in the vaccinated group at the end of the experimental period was 80%, whereas in the control group was 0%. Neutralizing antibody titers in serum and milk of control sow was negative throughout the experimental period, whereas high titers were observed in the vaccinated sows. The vaccinated farms significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED, compared to farms not vaccinated. Conclusions: The conventional PED live vaccine induced the lactogenic immunity to vaccinated sows and showed partial protection against the genogroup 2 virus both under the experimental and field conditions.",

The isolated viral strain was divided into previously reported strains in Japan and genetically similar to that reported in the US in May 2013. It was belonged to genogroup 2 according to the phylogenetic analysis of viral whole-genome sequences, also called the US prototype-like strains [2] . Subsequently, another genogroup 2 field strain called the INDEL (which has the insertion and deletion in the spike gene) strain was also isolated in Japan [3] . Further, Tottori2 strain with a larger deletion in the spike gene was reported in October 2014 [4] .

Previous studies of the PEDV spike protein have identified neutralizing COE region (498-637 aa), epitopes SS2 (747-754 aa), SS6 (763-770 aa), and 2C10 (1367-1373 aa) [17] [18] [19] . There was no difference in the epitopes SS2 and 2C10 between genogroup 1 and 2 viruses, however, two amino acid differences (Leu 763 and Asp 765 ) were found in the SS6 of P-5V compared to the genogroup 2 viruses. In the P-5V strain, four amino acids (Ala 516 , Thr 548 , Gly 593 , and Gln 632 ) were different from all genogroup 2 viruses, and one amino acid (Lys 620 ) was different from the MZ0116-2/2013 strain.

The vaccinated sows showed PED-specific antibody responses, and the neutralizing antibody was secreted in the colostrum. The vaccinated sows also showed a quick antibody response after the challenge. This quick antibody response suggests a possible booster effect by the infection of the sows with the virus shed from piglets. The above outcomes can contribute to reducing clinical signs and mortality rate in piglets derived from vaccinated sows by the live vaccine. Furthermore, the mortality rate before and after the onset of PED was reduced in vaccinated farms compared to a non-vaccinated farm. These results confirm that the PED live vaccine alleviates the damage is due to genogroup 2 field strains in not only experimental condition and also field farms. Further, it was also suggested that sows inoculated with the live vaccine prevented the progression of PED to a more severe condition. Differences in the amino acid sequences and Nlinked glycosylation sites found in this study may have an impact on the antigenicity between the vaccine strain and the genogroup 2 strain. It is necessary to carry out future research to elucidate neutralizing cross-reactivity between genogroup 1 and 2 viruses. PED monovalent and polyvalent (against PED and TGE) live vaccines have been used to prevent PED in Japan since late 1996. These vaccines are intramuscularly injected twice at intervals of 2 or 4 to 8 weeks in pregnant sows during the gestational period. Vaccinated sows secrete milk containing a neutralizing antibody against PEDV after farrowing. To secrete many neutralizing N. T. Not tested antibodies into the milk of vaccinated sows, it is preferable that the second vaccination is better as close as possible to the farrowing date, it is defined as 2 weeks before farrowing according to the manufacturer's instructions. The neutralizing antibody taken by piglets into the gastrointestinal tract neutralizes orally infecting PEDV and blocks viral entry into mucosal epithelial cells to relieve PED symptoms. This immunization mechanism of the PED vaccine in piglets is called \"lactogenic immunity\" and works based on a different action mechanism from the immunization of piglets by maternal antibody in the colostrum. Future study should examine whether the amount of virus is decreased in piglets by lactogenic immunity. The neutralizing antibody is considered to need to be continuously supplied to the gastrointestinal tract of piglets to prevent the onset of PED through milk. Piglets are infected with PEDV and become more severe when they are unable to take sufficient milk during the suckling period for some reason. Another problem is that when sows with low neutralizing antibody titer are exposed to a large amount of the virus, they develop systemic symptoms associated with reduced milk secretion, limiting the full effect of the vaccine. Considering the above mechanism of the PED vaccine, sufficiently increasing the level of immunity in sows before they are infected with PEDV is one of the important factors to prevent PED.",

PEDV included in infective materials cannot be stored for a long time in general home-use freezers. The use of sufficient virus level is not ensured in PED rebreak.

An ideal vaccine to overcome these problems would provide sows with mucosal immunity and piglets with more potent lactogenic immunity to protect both of them from the viral infection.
