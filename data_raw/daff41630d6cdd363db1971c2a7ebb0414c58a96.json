ZIKV is a positive-strand RNA virus replicating in virus-induced membranous replication factories (RFs). Here we used various imaging techniques to investigate the ultrastructural details of ZIKV RFs and their relationship with host cell organelles. Analyses of human hepatic cells and neural progenitor cells infected with ZIKV revealed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations containing pore-like openings toward the cytosol, reminiscent to RFs in Dengue virus-infected cells. Both the MR766 African strain and the H/PF/2013 Asian strain, the latter linked to neurological diseases, induce RFs of similar architecture. Importantly, ZIKV infection causes a drastic reorganization of microtubules and intermediate filaments forming cage-like structures surrounding the viral RF. Consistently, ZIKV replication is suppressed by cytoskeleton-targeting drugs. Thus, ZIKV RFs are tightly linked to rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton.",

Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but more recently, unsuspected transmission modes and symptoms unique to ZIKV have been reported. Of note, infection of pregnant women with ZIKV can lead to congenital transmission and eventually to severe microcephaly in new-borns (Pierson and Graham, 2016) . Moreover, ZIKV is sexually transmissible through undefined mechanisms, and other neurological manifestations such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been observed in infected individuals. Thus, intensive efforts have been undertaken to control this emerging disease, but neither antiviral therapies nor a prophylactic vaccine for ZIKV are currently available (Pierson and Graham, 2016) . This unmet medical need is exacerbated by the spread of the Aedes mosquito vector beyond tropical countries.",

However, the recent outbreaks of the contemporary Asian lineage in the Yap Islands and French Polynesia in 2007 and 2013, respectively, have raised major interest in ZIKV (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014; Duffy et al., 2009) . This Asian lineage is genetically closely related to the ''Brazilian strain'' currently spreading in the Americas and causing congenital microcephaly. Retrospective studies demonstrated that the French Polynesian strain also caused microcephaly (Cauchemez et al., 2016) , while it is hypothesized that the African lineage does not. More recently, the use of developing brain organoid models showed that in contrast to the African strain MR766, the Brazilian strain (Asian lineage) caused apoptosis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Cugola et al., 2016) . However, the viral determinants governing ZIKV pathogenesis are still unknown.",

Notably, flaviviruses, including ZIKV (Hamel et al., 2015) , induce invaginations of the ER giving rise to clusters of vesicles designated vesicle packets (VPs), which are the presumed sites of viral RNA replication. Using electron tomography, several studies reported the 3D architecture of VPs formed during Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infections (Paul and Bartenschlager, 2013) . In most of these studies, the vesicles are linked to the cytoplasm via an $10-nm-wide opening. This pore might allow the exit of the positive-strand RNA genome into the cytoplasm to be used for polyprotein synthesis (RNA translation) or packaging into virus particles budding into the ER lumen at sites juxtaposed to the VPs ). In addition, in the case of WNV, vesicles were reported to be interconnected by a pore (Gillespie et al., 2010) . Two additional ER-derived structures can be detected in flavivirusinfected cells: (1) convoluted membranes (CMs) accumulating in DENV-, TBEV-, and WNV-infected cells (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014) ; and (2) DENV particles accumulating in regular arrays within enlarged ER cisternae. These ''virus bags'' might constitute a pool of assembled particles accumulating at this site prior to transport out of the cell. This transport is linked to proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein by the cellular enzyme furin and it is required to render virions infectious (Acosta et al., 2014) .",

Furthermore, several studies identified a massive alteration of the cytoskeleton by some flaviviruses. For instance, intermediate filament and microtubule networks are reorganized in cells infected with DENV serotype 2 and their pharmacological disruption affects several steps of the viral replication cycle (Chen et al., 2008; Teo and Chu, 2014) . Interestingly, the intermediate filament component vimentin associates with DENV NS4A and is important for the perinuclear localization of replication complexes (Teo and Chu, 2014) .

In addition to the brain and placenta, the liver is one of the organs targeted by ZIKV in vivo in both the dam and fetus (Adams Waldorf et al., 2016) . Therefore, we used Huh7 human hepatoma cells, because they are highly susceptible to infection with several flaviviruses. Using immunofluorescence-based visualization of double-stranded (ds) RNA, a well-established replication intermediate, virus replication was detected as early as 4 hr postinfection in a low percentage of cells, with the percentage increasing up to 100% of cells 48 hr post-infection ( Figures  1A and 1B) . Interestingly, although the percentage of infected cells was similar for both strains, we retrieved up to 10-fold higher extracellular virus titers for the Asian H/PF/2013 strain ( Figure 1C ). This might be due to the stronger cytotoxic effects exerted by the African MR766 strain, as revealed by the higher number of dead cells at late time points after infection (data not shown).",

Indeed, these cells were well permissive for both the MR766 and H/PF/2013 strains, with around 60% of cells becoming infected within 36 hr after infection ( Figures S2A and S2B ). Both strains replicated to comparable levels, as revealed by quantification of intracellular ZIKV RNA ( Figure S2C ), and virus titers were on the order of 10 6 PFU/mL (Figure S2D) . Importantly, ZIKV also induced profound alterations of intermediate filaments and microtubules in this cell system, consistent with phenotypes detected in Huh7 cells (Figures S3A and S3B) . Most striking was the effect on the intermediate filaments, as revealed by staining for nestin, an intermediate filament marker characteristic for neural stem and progenitor cells. As shown in Figure S3A , nestin filaments collapsed toward the perinuclear region, surrounding a dsRNA-positive structure presumably corresponding to the viral RFs (see below). Moreover, when visualized by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which we used to discriminate between filamentous and non-filamentous structures, nestin filaments accumulated toward the periphery of the virus-induced structure, whereas the diffuse nestin signal present within the NS3-positive region suggested filament depolymerization within this particular area ( Figure S3C ).",

The observed microtubule displacement from the perinuclear region and the microtubule disassembly at the late time post-infection prompted us to evaluate the role of microtubules for ZIKV replication. To avoid any potential effect on viral entry, we first identified the endpoint of entry by using bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of endosome acidification that prevents the fusion step between the Titers of ZIKV particles released from Huh7 cells pretreated 2 hr prior to infection or 3 hr post-infection with bafilomycin A1 (Baf; 2.5 nM).

Bafilomycin sensitivity was lost 3 hr post-infection, indicating that ZIKV entry and fusion were completed within this time span ( Figure 2D ). To examine the function of microtubules in ZIKV infection, we treated ZIKV-infected Huh7 cells with noncytotoxic concentrations of paclitaxel ( Figure 2E ), a microtubule-stabilizing drug. Immunofluorescence microscopy staining of a-tubulin demonstrated that the drug performed as expected, causing the formation of thick bundles of microtubules (Figure 2F ). The compound was then provided 3 hr after infection with ZIKV strains, and virus titers were analyzed 24 hr post-infection ( Figure 2G ). Strikingly, paclitaxel treatment strongly reduced viral titers, suggesting that microtubule dynamics is required for efficient ZIKV infection. Of note, the same phenotype was observed in hNPCs, supporting the conclusion that cytoskeleton flexibility is also required for the ZIKV replication cycle in human neural progenitor cells (Figures S3D and S3E) .",

To this end, we applied focus ion beam (FIB)-scanning electron microscopy to obtain a 3D overview of the cytoplasmic organization of the infected cell. To identify infected cells for this analysis, we used a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescently labeled ER marker Sec61b (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016) . Given the close similarity of DENV and ZIKV, we assumed that this protein accumulates in CMs, analogous to what we reported earlier for DENV-infected cells (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016) . Huh7 cells were infected with the MR766 strain and 24 hr later, cells containing Sec61b clusters were selected by correlative light and electron microscopy (EM) and processed for subsequent FIB-scanning electron microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A ). Following serial imaging and 3D reconstruction, the cytoplasm of the infected cells was found to display large areas covered by CMs with VPs located at the periphery of these structures and also accumulating in the perinuclear region ( Figure 3A ; Movie S2). Of note, the 3D reconstruction revealed cytoskeleton filaments surrounding most of the virus-induced VPs, while the large CM aggregates were located outside this region. This distribution nicely corroborated our immunofluorescence data described above and further implies that the perinuclear region containing both dsRNA and NS3 corresponds to the area where the majority of VPs accumulate.",

Consistent with the membranous alterations induced by the closely related DENV ) and other flaviviruses such as TBEV and WNV (Gillespie et al., 2010; Miorin et al., 2013) , ZIKV induced an organelle-like compartment consisting of arrays of invaginated vesicles within dilated ER sheets; their decoration with ribosomes found in several instances (e.g., Figure 3B ) argues for rough ER. Bundles of presumably intermediate filaments were observed in close proximity of the VPs (Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S3). As previously reported for other flavirivuses (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014), the lumen of the invaginated vesicles was connected to the cytosol via a narrow pore-like structure. The calculated pore width of 10.9 \u00b1 1.6 nm (n = 8) was comparable to the pore size observed in DENV-infected cells (11.2 \u00b1 1.6 nm) ). Similar to DENV, ER sheets containing virus particles were often found adjacent to virus-induced invaginated vesicles on the opposite side of the pore ( Figures 4D and 4E) , suggesting that ZIKV particles bud in close proximity to the genome replication site. Although the pore-like structure was readily visible, a connection between adjacent vesicles was not observed ( Figures 4D and 4E , yellow arrows). These results are similar to those previously described for DENV ) and TBEV (Miorin et al., 2013) but differ from what has been reported for WNV (Gillespie et al., 2010) or Langat virus (Offerdahl et al., 2012) . 3D reconstruction of regions encompassing the zippered ER revealed that the collapsed ER was contiguous with regions containing invaginated vesicles (Figures 4F-4H ; Movie S4), suggesting a transition from a swollen ER area filled with virus-induced vesicles to a luminally restricted area.",

To this end, hNPCs were infected with either ZIKV strains; 24 hr later, cells were fixed and analyzed by TEM. Inspection of mock cells revealed stacked rough ER cisternae forming an organized network surrounding the nucleus, with mitochondria dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and often in contact with the ER (Figures 5A  and 5B ). However, in infected cells, the rough ER appeared as a convoluted tangle of cisternae creating a large perinuclear inclusion residing on the concave side of the kidney-shaped nucleus ( Figures 5C and 5E ). Mitochondria accumulated on the periphery of the convoluted rough (r)ER region (Figures 5C,  5E , and 5F). Virus-induced vesicles were often observed to cluster within regions of more densely packed rER ( Figures  5D, 5F , and 5G). Such areas were more frequent and prominent in MR766-infected cells (Figures 5E-5H) . Cytoskeletal filaments were observed on the edge of the ER region ( Figures 5D and  5G) . The average diameters of ZIKV-induced vesicles was 62.80 \u00b1 0.49 nm (n = 516) and 65.51 \u00b1 0.56 nm (n = 457) for the African and the Asian strains, respectively. Compared to the vesicle diameters observed in Huh7 cells, ZIKV-induced vesicles in infected hNPCs appeared smaller ( Figure S4) , arguing that vesicle size might be cell-type dependent. Another difference among the two cell lines was the complete absence of convoluted smooth ER membranes and zippered rough ER in infected hNPCs.",

Virus-induced vesicles appeared as tightly stacked invaginations within the rough ER with narrow pores connecting the luminal side of the vesicles with the cytosol (Figures 6C-6H ). Comparable to Huh7 cells, no connections were observed among adjacent vesicles in hNPCs. Quantification of pore sizes revealed an average width of 11.4 \u00b1 1.2 nm and 10.7 \u00b1 1.9 nm in H/PF/2013and MR766-infected hNPCs, respectively. Interestingly, although vesicle diameters were different, pores sizes were comparable not only between hNPCs and Huh7 cells but also between the two virus strains, arguing that the vesicle pore is formed by viral proteins only or by a conserved cellular machinery. Consistent with previous observations, virions were found in close proximity to the invaginated vesicles, usually within tightly opposed ER sheets ( Figures 6B and 6F ). Diffuse electron density was observed on the cytosolic side of the vesicle pore, together with frequent virion budding events occurring within the opposed ER sheet ( Figure 6F ). 3D reconstruction of virion accumulations revealed that ZIKV particles stacked in regular arrays inside enlarged ER cisternae, which are contiguous and connected to VPs within the same ER compartment. In addition, an intricate network of intermediate filaments was present in close proximity of the ER membranes, although single filaments rather than bundles were observed.",

While Offerdahl et al. (2017) recently reported low-resolution electron tomography of ZIKV-induced vesicles in infected neuroblastoma cells, our study unveils detailed features of ZIKV RFs in hNPCs. Similar to DENV, WNV, and TBEV (B\u00edl\u00fd et al., 2015; Gillespie et al., 2010; Junjhon et al., 2014; Miorin et al., 2013; , ZIKV-induced VPs are also located within the ER lumen, implying that the vesicles originate from this organelle. Hence, all flaviviruses appear to share similar hallmarks of the architecture of their respective RFs. Since DENV VPs were shown to be associated with dsRNA (Junjhon et al., 2014; , these structures are believed to be the site of RNA replication. This spatial segregation would allow concentrating metabolites required for RNA replication while protecting viral RNA from cellular nucleases and innate immunity-triggering cytosolic RNA sensors. Furthermore, we observed a pore-like opening toward the cytosol allowing the exit of neo-synthesized positive-strand viral RNA into the cytoplasm, where it could be used for protein synthesis or virion formation. Very interestingly, electron-dense structures resembling virions could be detected in ER regions that were juxtaposed to the pore of VPs (Figures 6F and 6H ). This suggests that particle assembly (including viral RNA encapsidation) and budding are spatially coordinated with RNA replication, reminiscent of what we reported for DENV .",

As for IBV, the precise role of zippered ER for ZIKV replication remains unknown, although they appear to be unique to ZIKV in the genus Flavivirus. Of note, CMs and zippered ER were not found in NPCs. This was probably not due to virus replication, since virus yields were comparable at the time point of TEM analysis (24 hr post-infection). This discrepancy might be due to cell-type-specific differences in the availability of host factors required for CM and zippered ER biogenesis.

Interestingly, DENV, WNV, JEV, and TBEV also induce cytoskeleton remodeling (Chen et al., 2008; Chiou et al., 2003; Ng and Hong, 1989; R uzek et al., 2009; Teo and Chu, 2014) . In fact, treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing drug enhances DENV production (Chen et al., 2008) , suggesting that DENV and ZIKV have developed similar cytoskeleton remodeling strategies. Yeast two-hybridbased interaction screenings identified the intermediate filament vimentin as an interactant of flaviviral NS5 (Le Breton et al., 2011) . Moreover, vimentin was reported to interact with the N terminus of DENV NS4A and to colocalize with replication complexes (Teo and Chu, 2014) . In contrast, we found that intermediate filaments surround ZIKV RFs in the perinuclear (MTOCpositive) area, arguing for differences between ZIKV and DENV cytoskeleton remodeling.",

Interestingly, such a model was recently proposed for the related hepatitis C virus (HCV). Indeed, the HCV RF excludes retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) by the recruitment of specific nuclear pore proteins . Considering the accepted role of the cytoskeleton in innate immunity (Mostowy and Shenoy, 2015) , it is tempting to speculate that ZIKV-mediated remodeling of the cytoskeleton might interfere with antiviral responses to favor viral replication. This might be either by direct contribution of the cytoskeleton or indirectly by promoting RF formation. In support to the latter assumption, evidence has been presented that both TBEV and the flavivirus Kunjin virus shield viral dsRNA in ER membrane invaginations from sensing by RIG-like receptors (Hoenen et al., 2007; Overby et al., 2010) . Further work (e.g., by using pharmacological inhibitors) will be needed to unravel the possible role of the cytoskeleton in the biogenesis of the ZIKV RF and how ZIKV-induced cytoskeleton remodeling might interfere with the innate immune response.",

For instance, vimentin knockout mice have an altered morphology of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (Colucci-Guyon et al., 1999) . In addition, neurofilaments, a sub-class of intermediate filaments, determine the diameter of myelinated axons (Elder et al., 1999) and a mutation in b3-tubulin is associated with defects of commissural axons and cranial nerves (Tischfield et al., 2010) . Of note, intermediate filaments also possess cytoprotective functions such as apoptosis inhibition, organelle anchoring, and regulation of cell growth as well as motility (Snider and Omary, 2014; Toivola et al., 2010) . It is therefore tempting to speculate that the remodeling of the cytoskeleton by ZIKV might contribute to the severe fetal neurogenesis defects following congenital viral transmission. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms regulating the biogenesis of ZIKV RFs might help to develop novel therapies suppressing virus replication and reducing the risk of congenital transmission and microcephaly.",
