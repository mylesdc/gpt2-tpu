            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has attracted global attention due to its close association with congenital Zika syndrome and neurological diseases, and transmission through additional routes, such as sexual contact. Currently there are no vaccines approved for ZIKV, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe ZIKV vaccine. Domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein is an important vaccine target, and a vaccine developed using a mutant DIII of E (EDIII) protein protects adult and pregnant mice, and unborn offspring, against ZIKV infection. Here, we have used immunocompetent BALB/c mice treated with anti-interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1 (Ifnar1) antibodies to investigate whether three adjuvants (aluminum (Alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), and MF59), either alone or in combination, could improve the efficacy of this EDIII subunit vaccine. Our data show that, although vaccine formulated with a single adjuvant induced a specific antibody and cellular immune response, and reduced viral load in mice challenged with ZIKV, the combination of Alum and MPL adjuvants led to a more robust and balanced immune response, stronger neutralizing activity against three recent ZIKV human strains, and greater protection against a high-dose ZIKV challenge. Particularly, the combination of Alum with MPL significantly reduced viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers in sera and tissues, including the male reproductive organs. Overall, this study has identified the combination of Alum and MPL as the most effective adjuvant for ZIKV EDIII subunit vaccines, and it has important implications for subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses, including non-ZIKV flaviviruses.",

The E protein has important roles in infection and pathogenesis, is involved in virus binding to target cells and membrane fusion, and also serves as an important vaccine target [7, 8] . The E protein is a transmembrane protein and consists of three domains termed I, II, and III (DI-DIII), a fusion loop (FL), and a stalk region (S) [8] . The DI-DII region of ZIKV E protein is a target for cross-reactive antibodies with other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), whereas the DIII domain induces ZIKV-specific antibodies [10] [11] [12] , and therefore, is a key target for ZIKV vaccine development. ZIKV vaccine candidates under development include inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, DNA, mRNA, viral vectors, virus-like particles (VLPs), and viral proteins (or subunit vaccines) [13] [14] [15] [16] . Although many have advanced clinical trials and been tested for immunogenicity and/or levels of protection [17] [18] [19] , none are approved for use in humans. Thus, continuous efforts are required to develop safe and efficacious ZIKV vaccines.",

However, subunit vaccines often suffer from low immunogenicity, although this may be improved by adjuvants. Adjuvants are important components of vaccines as they enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens by boosting the quality and duration of the humoral and/or cellular immune response. Aluminum salts (Alum) are approved for use as adjuvants for human vaccines in the U.S. They are also key components of vaccines for a number of viruses including Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human Papilloma virus (HPV) [22, 23] . The Alum adjuvants most commonly used in licensed vaccines are Alum hydroxide and Alum phosphate [24] . Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a non-toxic derivative of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, can also be used as an adjuvant for human vaccines [25] . In addition, AS04 (a combination of Alum and MPL) is used in vaccines for HBV and HPV [23], while MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion) has been approved for use with conjugated vaccines for a number of viruses, including influenza virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [22, 23] .",

Here, using this EDIII-based subunit vaccine, we compared the adjuvanticity of MF59, Alum, MPL, or Alum + MPL combination (refer to AS04), in a hope to identify an adjuvant or adjuvant combination that is able to promote the EDIII-based ZIKV vaccine to induce a balanced immune response and potent protection against ZIKV infection. Our results show that a more balanced (Th1/Th2) immune response is generated and that the immunogenicity and the ability to protect against ZIKV infection are significantly enhanced when both Alum and MPL are used in the same vaccine formulation. This study has identified the combination of Alum with MPL as an effective adjuvant formulation for ZIKV EDIII-based subunit vaccines.",

At seven days following the second dose, sera were collected and the antibody titers specific to ZIKV EDIII (containing a C-terminal hFc tag) or E (without fusion with hFc) were determined ( Figure 1 ). When used without an adjuvant, EDIII was immunogenic and induced EDIII-specific IgG antibodies (total IgG), while inclusion of Alum or MF59 adjuvant significantly improved the antibody response. Although MPL did not appear to enhance the antibody response to EDIII, when used in combination with Alum, the antibody response was significantly higher than for EDIII with Alum or MF59 alone ( Figure 2A ). Since EDIII protein was fused with the hFc tag, IgG antibodies targeting hFc were also generated, showing a similar trend as those specific to EDIII ( Figure 2B ). Nevertheless, when coating the ELISA plate with a ZIKV full-length E protein without hFc, significantly high-titer IgG antibodies were induced, particularly in the Alum and MPL-adjuvanted EDIII ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that fusion of hFc to the EDIII subunit vaccine did not affect the generation of ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies. multiple comparison test based on the GraphPad Prism Statistical Software. *, **, and *** indicate p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.",

In addition, MF59 was included as a control adjuvant. At seven days following the second dose, sera were collected and the antibody titers specific to ZIKV EDIII (containing a C-terminal hFc tag) or E (without fusion with hFc) were determined ( Figure 1 ). When used without an adjuvant, EDIII was immunogenic and induced EDIIIspecific IgG antibodies (total IgG), while inclusion of Alum or MF59 adjuvant significantly improved the antibody response. Although MPL did not appear to enhance the antibody response to EDIII, when used in combination with Alum, the antibody response was significantly higher than for EDIII with Alum or MF59 alone ( Figure 2A ). Since EDIII protein was fused with the hFc tag, IgG antibodies targeting hFc were also generated, showing a similar trend as those specific to EDIII ( Figure 2B ). Nevertheless, when coating the ELISA plate with a ZIKV full-length E protein without hFc, significantly high-titer IgG antibodies were induced, particularly in the Alum and MPL-adjuvanted EDIII ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that fusion of hFc to the EDIII subunit vaccine did not affect the generation of ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies. Immunization and challenge schedule. Mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with PBS (background control) or with ZIKV EDIII without an adjuvant, or with aluminum salts (Alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), Alum + MPL, or MF59 adjuvant and boosted at day 21 after the initial dose. Sera were collected at seven days after the boost (day 28) and used to determine ZIKV E or EDIII-specific antibody, and neutralizing antibody levels. Mice were injected with an anti-interferon\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1 (Ifnar1) antibody (in order to become susceptible to subsequent ZIKV infection) [36, 37] at nine days after the boost (day 30) and subsequently challenged with ZIKV (strain R103451, 6 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming unit (PFU)) the following day (day 31). Sera and tissue samples were collected three days post-challenge (day 34) and used to determine ZIKV titers and viral load (RNA copies). Splenocytes were also tested for the ZIKV EDIII-specific cellular immune response. Immunization and challenge schedule.

Splenocytes were also tested for the ZIKV EDIII-specific cellular immune response. combination of Alum with MPL adjuvant induced significantly higher IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers than either Alum or MPL alone, or when MF59 was the adjuvant ( Figure 2D ,E). When used in combination, MPL and Alum adjuvants induced a more balanced antibody response, indicated by a low IgG1 (Th2)/IgG2a (Th1) ratio. In contrast, Alum generated a Th2-biased IgG1 antibody response, while EDIII alone, or when formulated with MF59, showed a slight Th2 bias ( Figure 2F ). The above data demonstrate that the combination of Alum with MPL adjuvant enhanced the levels of EDIIIspecific IgG antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2a) and produced a more balanced IgG response. ",

For CD45 + -CD8 + T cells, inclusion of Alum significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 expression, while IL-4 expression was increased by Alum and MF59 ( Figure 4D,E) . When used in combination, Alum with MPL adjuvant significantly enhanced expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 cytokines tested in both CD45 + -CD4 + and CD45 + -CD8 + T cells over that observed when the adjuvants (Alum, MPL, and/or MF59) were used individually ( Figure 4A,B,D,E) . These data indicate that although individual adjuvants enhanced the EDIII-specific cellular immune response, the combination of Alum with MPL had a greater effect, particularly in CD45 + -CD8 + T cells.

In addition, Alum and MPL, when used in combination, enhanced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) by CD4 + , particularly CD8 + , T cells. Viral vaccines (e.g., against HBV and HPV) formulated with a combination of Alum and MPL adjuvants (i.e., AS04) stimulate antigen-specific T and B cells, resulting in stronger antibody (including neutralizing antibodies) and cellular responses than vaccines formulated using Alum alone [22, 44] . Using the ZIKV EDIII protein as a model antigen, our study has confirmed these observations by showing that a combination of Alum and MPL adjuvants enhanced the immunogenicity of EDIII over that observed with single adjuvants (Figures 2-6) , whereas the Alum and MPL combination alone without EDIII was unable to elicit ZIKV-specific immune response and protection against ZIKV infection [26, 27] .",

To carry out challenge studies, we used BALB/c mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 antibodies, which also render mice susceptible to ZIKV infection [36, 37] . Formulation of EDIII with individual adjuvants improved protection against high-dose ZIKV challenge, and was consistent with our virus neutralization studies results, that is, the combination of Alum with MPL significantly improved protection further. This was confirmed by showing that a combination of Alum with MPL as the adjuvant significantly reduced viral titers and viral RNA copies in sera and tissues compared to other immunization regimes. ZIKV can be transmitted through sexual contact, the virus can persist in female or male (testes and seminal vesicles) reproductive organs for a prolonged period, and viral RNA can be detected in semen for up to one year after ZIKV infection [53, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Thus, vaccines that reduce viral load in reproductive organs will likely be more effective in reducing virus transmission during sexual contact. Importantly, our results show that EDIII formulation using Alum and MPL in combination significantly reduced viral RNA in the testes of ZIKV-challenged mice, thereby confirming that this adjuvant combination is most likely to yield greater vaccine efficacy than single adjuvants alone. In contrast, EDIII alone without adjuvant(s) resulted in the highest viral titers and viral RNA copies in sera and tissues tested among all vaccination groups, including reproductive organs, which were only slightly lower than those in PBS-injected control mice. It has been shown that protection against ZIKV infection is positively correlated with serum neutralizing antibody titers [26, 27] ; thus, the high-level ZIKV in the EDIII alone-immunized mice identified above may be partially due to the relatively low serum neutralizing antibody titer induced in these mice.",

Fusion of Fc tag to recombinant proteins may promote the proteins to form dimeric structures, significantly improving their solubility, stability, and avidity, as well as increasing their immunogenicity and/or efficacy [64] [65] [66] . Fc-fused vaccine design has been applied in subunit vaccines against HIV, influenza virus, Ebola virus, and other emerging or reemerging viruses [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . In terms of ZIKV vaccines, a Fc-fused E protein dimer (ZE-Fc) has been shown to mimic native dimeric status of E protein and induce higher neutralizing antibodies than a monomeric E protein without Fc (monZE) [71] . We have also found that hFc-fused ZIKV EDIII proteins form dimeric structures capable of eliciting high-titer antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies, and protection against high-dose ZIKV infection (Figures 2, 3, 5 and 6 ) [27] , consistent with previous findings.",
