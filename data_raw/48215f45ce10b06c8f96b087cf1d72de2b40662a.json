Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1-and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (\u00b5M concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52-expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein-and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.",

The virus, however, does not seem capable of traversing distances by small-particle aerosols. Nevertheless, it is able to remain infectious on various environmental surfaces, suggesting fomites as a source of spread. These characteristics imply that RSV can be easily spread on hospital wards during a community break of RSV infection. The potential for nosocomial RSV infections is further enhanced by the crowding on pediatric wards that occur during such a community outbreak since, particularly in winter and early spring, a great proportion of admissions are infants with LRTIrelated diseases who shed the virus in particularly high titer.",

The mechanism of action of this drug is based on the inhibition of RNA transcription; as such, ribavirin is characterized by a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, potential toxicity, besides relatively high cost (Ventre and Randolph, 2007) . Moreover, the use of ribavirin is still limited because beneficial effects on clinical outcomes remain unproved (Ohmit et al., 1996; Snell, 2001) . This scenario makes RSV-a negative-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA member of the Pneumoviridae family-an important target for the research and development of new antivirals.",

RSV entry into target cells is mediated by the two glycoproteins G and F. These glycopolypeptides are packed in a dense layer on the viral surface, together with a third, small hydrophobic polypeptide (SH), whose function remains unknown. Primary adsorption of the virus to the target cell is generally promoted by the G protein, with sialic acid residues or cell surface proteins serving as receptors. Viral entry is then facilitated by the fusion F protein that adopts a metastable prefusion conformation when in its active form. After attachment of F to host-cell factors, one or more of these factors trigger the protein conformational rearrangement that results in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Since F is essential for RSV infection, humans elicit neutralizing antibodies that target it, with the most potent recognizing the prefusion conformation. Accordingly, this conformation of F is considered to be the ideal vaccine antigen, and antibodies and small molecules that disrupt its structure and function constitute a very active field of current research.",

On the contrary, the presence of two acyl substituents on the amino group (5d) was detrimental to antiviral activity. In essence, these results demonstrate the need for a hydrogen atom on the amide nitrogen for RSV replication inhibition. Conversely, in the case of aromatic amides the unsubstituted phenyl derivative (7a) showed only a moderate activity (EC 50 = 60 \u00b5M) whereas the introduction of three methoxy groups on the phenyl moiety (7d) or an electron-withdrawing group in the 4' position (7e-h) potentiated anti-RSV activity (EC 50 = 5-35 \u00b5M, Table 1 ). On the other hand, an electron-donor methyl group in the same position (7b) led to a pitfall of the corresponding EC 50 value. Finally, for the series of 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-benzotriazole amides a small alkyl group on the nitrogen gave the best antiviral activity, while its substitution with a phenyl ring was only useful if an electron-withdrawing or three methoxy groups were presents.",

G targets the ciliated cells of the airways, and F causes the virion membrane to fuse with the target cell membrane. The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is also encoded by the human respiratory syncytial virus. Its absence leads to viral attenuation in the context of whole organisms, and it prevents apoptosis in infected cells (Heminway et al., 1994; Kahn et al., 1999; Techaarpornkul et al., 2001) . Among this protein pool, however, the F protein alone is sufficient to mediate viral penetration into host cells and subsequent syncytium formation during RSV infection (Feldman et al., 2000) . As it can be seen in Figure 3 (right panel), 10d was effective in reducing both syncytia area and number at a concentration of 50 \u00b5M. This evidence suggests that 10d could interfere with the RSV F protein-mediated syncytium formation. (e,f) dextran sulfate inhibits viral attachment; (g,h) 10d does not inhibit viral attachment.

Nonetheless, cp-52 is infectious and replicates to high titer in tissue cultures (Karron et al., 1997) . In the plaque-reduction assay, 10d inhibited RSV cp-52 activity with 50% inhibitory concentration of 7 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M, a value comparable to the one determined for the wild-type strain (EC 50 = 2 \u00b5M, Table 1 ). In analogy, the two alternative potent compounds 10b and 8d, tested under the same conditions, gave comparable results (50% inhibitory concentration = 7 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b1 2 \u00b5M or 10b and 8d, respectively).

Thus, we speculated that these two compounds could adopt a binding mode onto the trimeric RSV F-protein similar to that proposed for 10d. To verify this hypothesis, the same computational approach was applied to the 8d/ and 10b/protein complexes ( Figure S2 ). As expected, the replacement of the cyclohexyl ring of 10d with a propyl chain in 10b did not lead to any significant variation in the interaction spectrum described for 10d: indeed, both fundamental hydrogen bonds and the nice molecular encasement in the protein hydrophobic cavities are still detected along the entire simulation trajectory ( Figure S2A) . Accordingly, the binding energetic profile is utterlt comparable to that calculated for the 10d/protein complex with a G bind of \u22127.18 \u00b1 0.31 kcal/mol ( H bind = \u221221.28 \u00b1 0.18 kcal/mol and -T S bind = +14.10 \u00b1 0.25 kcal/mol, IC 50 = 8.7 \u00b5M). On the other hand, the replacement of the ureidic spacer with an amidic moiety in 8d allows to perform only the hydrogen bond involving the compound oxygen atom ( Figure S2B ). Despite this, 8d is provided with a good affinity against the RSV F-protein, with a calculated IC 50 of 12.5 \u00b5M ( G bind = \u22126.96 \u00b1 0.29 kcal/mol). Although a slight decrease in the enthalpic contribution has been detected ( H bind = \u221220.32 \u00b1 0.16 kcal/mol), 8d compensates with a less entropic penalty, justified from the presence of a more rigid 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzamide group in its structure.",

Specifically, the hydrophobic pocket of protomer A (consisting of residues F140, M396, and F488) and the side chains of F137 and F488 of protomer B can properly accommodate the benzimidazole moiety of TMC353121 through favorable hydrophobic interactions. The morpholine group of the inhibitor optimizes protein binding by exploiting specific electrostatic interactions, i.e., the positively charged hydrogen atom performs a permanent ionic bridge with E487 of protomer C, while the oxygen atom is engaged in a stable dipole interaction with the side-chain of E487 (protomer B). Actually, the better binding performance of TMC353121 with respect to 10d is related to the presence of two bulky substituents on its benzimidazole ring: a) the (3-hydroxypropyl)-5-methylphenyl moiety, which favorably interacts with the aromatic side chain of F140 of protomer C via a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, and b) the 2-hydroxy-3-methylpiridin group, which not only performs positive hydrophobic interactions with F140 (protomer B) and F488 (protomer C) but is also engaged in a hydrogen bond with E487 (protomer C). The corresponding binding thermodynamics for the TMC353121/F-protein complex formation, i.e., G bind = \u221210.96 \u00b1 0.31 kcal/mol, H bind = \u221226.57 \u00b1 0.19 kcal/mol, and -T S bind = +15.61 \u00b1 0.25 kcal/mol), reflect the high affinity of this compound in binding the RSV F-protein, with a calculated IC 50 of 19 nM, in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental value (IC 50 = 8.7 nM, Battles et al., 2016) .",
