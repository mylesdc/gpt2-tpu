In vitro assays revealed that the inhibitory effects of these compounds were manifested at different steps of TBSV replication. QC was shown to have an effect on multiple steps, including: (i) inhibition of the selective binding of the p33 replication protein to the viral RNA template, which is required for recruitment of viral RNA for replication; (ii) reduction of minus-strand synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase; and (iii) inhibition of translation of the uncapped TBSV genomic RNA. In contrast, CPZ was shown to inhibit the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase, likely due to binding of CPZ to intracellular membranes, which are important for RNA virus replication.",

Therefore, it is important to develop antiviral strategies to efficiently combat viral infections. One intriguing approach is the use of small molecule inhibitors of viral infections as demonstrated by the use of ribavirin against hepatitis C virus (HCV), respiratory syncytial virus and treatment of Lassa fever as well as amantadine and rimantadine M2 channel inhibitors and zanamivir and oseltamivir neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza virus [1, 2, 3] . Additional 40 antiviral drugs have been approved for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and herpesviruses [2] . To find additional inhibitors of viral infections, researchers screened small molecule libraries that identified a few more potent antiviral chemicals [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] .",

Therefore, we have chosen a simple model virus, Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), to test small molecule inhibitors. TBSV, a small (+)RNA virus of plants, has emerged as a highly suitable model virus for studying viral RNA replication and recombination [10] . The genomic (+)RNA of TBSV codes for p33 and p92 pol replication proteins [10] . p33 is an essential replication co-factor performing recruitment of the viral RNA template into replication [11, 12, 13] , and in the assembly of the viral replicase [14] . The p92 pol is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [15, 16, 17] . Both replication proteins are integral part of the tombusvirus replicase complex, which also contains host proteins [18, 19] . Several of these host factors have been identified via proteomics approaches [19, 20, 21] . The list includes the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Ssa1/2p in yeast), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p), Cdc34p ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) [19, 20, 21] . These host factors provide various functions, such as facilitating the assembly of the viral replicase complex and promoting asymmetrical viral RNA synthesis [22, 23, 24, 25] .",

Besides their anti-prion effect, QC and CPZ have been used in humans for many years, respectively, as antimalarial and antipsychotic drugs [29, 30, 31] . Detailed studies on the mechanism of inhibition revealed that inhibition by CPZ and QC was due to effects of these compounds on the following steps: (i) inhibition of the assembly of the viral replicase complex (for CPZ), suppression of production of viral replication proteins during translation (for QC); (ii) inhibition of RNA-viral protein interaction during RNA recruitment for replication (for QC); and reducing minus-strand synthesis (for QC). Altogether, these acridine derivatives could be useful antiviral compounds against selected plant viruses.",

            "text": "To define the mode of action for these acridine derivatives leading to inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation, we took advantage of efficient in vitro replication assays developed for tombusviruses. First, we used an in vitro replicase assembly assay that includes purified recombinant TBSV p33 and p92 pol replication proteins and a yeast cell-free extract [23] . This cellfree system can be programmed with plus-stranded (+)TBSV replicon (rep)RNA, which leads to the assembly of the TBSV replicase on the membranes. The in vitro assembled replicase is capable of supporting complete cycle of TBSV replication leading to the production of (+)repRNA progeny [23, 32] . Testing the effect of CPZ and QC revealed 90-95% inhibition of TBSV replication when the chemicals were applied at an early time point of the assay ( Fig. 2A , lanes 2-4 and 10-12). In the in vitro replicase assembly assay, the first 40 min consist of recruitment of the repRNA, the viral replication proteins and host proteins, such as Hsp70 to the membrane [23, 32] , followed by the assembly of the membrane-bound replicase complex, whereas viral RNA synthesis occurs after ,20-40 min of incubation until ,3 hours. These experiments revealed that both CPZ and QC inhibited TBSV repRNA replication when added at the beginning of incubation (0 time point) ( Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 12) , while they were not as Figure 1 . Inhibition of TBSV gRNA accumulation in N. benthamiana protoplasts by treatment with CPZ or QC. Northern blot analysis with a 39 end specific probe was used to detect the accumulation levels of TBSV gRNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs. The N. benthamiana protoplasts were treated with the shown concentrations of CPZ and QC either before or after electroporation. The samples were harvested 40 hours after electroporation. The ethidium-bromide stained gel at the bottom shows the ribosomal (r)RNA levels as loading controls. As a control, DMSO, the solvent for CPZ and QC, concentrations were the following: 0.04%, lanes 2,6; 0.005%, lanes 3,7, 12; 0.01%, lanes 4,8,13; and 0.02%, lanes 5 and 9. Note that the gRNA can reach rRNA levels in N. benthamiana protoplasts. The survival of the plant cells (after electroporation and treatment) was checked by measuring rRNA levels in total RNA extracts. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007376.g001 effective at the 60-min time point (lanes 1 and 9). This suggests that CPZ and QC likely inhibit the early steps in virus replication, possibly including the recruitment of the viral RNA or the assembly of the functional replicase complex in the membrane, while they could only partially inhibit viral RNA synthesis in vitro.",

CPZ is known to bind to phospholipids and modify the features of membranes [33] . Therefore, we have tested if treatment of the membranes by CPZ could affect the subsequent assembly of the TBSV replicase. First, we pretreated the membrane fraction of the yeast cell extract for 15 min with either CPZ, QC or DMSO as a control, and then we washed the membrane fraction with buffer A to remove the chemicals not bound to membrane lipids. Second, to the pre-treated membrane fraction, we added the TBSV (+)repRNA and the purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol proteins in combination with the The first in vitro replication assay contained a yeast cell-free extract, purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol , a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled nucleotides and was programmed with TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA. CPZ, QC and DMSO were added to the assay at 0, 20, 40 or 60 min after the start of the assay, which lasted for 3 hours. The newly made repRNA products were analyzed on denaturing PAGE. Note that the repRNA goes through a full replication cycle in this replication assay, producing mostly (+)-stranded progeny RNAs. (B) The second in vitro replication assay was similar to that described in panel A, except that the membrane fraction of the yeast cell-free extract was treated with CPZ, QC or DMSO first, followed by a washing step to remove the unbound compounds. This was followed by the addition of the soluble fraction of the yeast cell-free extract, purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol , a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled nucleotides and was programmed with TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA. DMSO concentrations were the following: 0.05%, lanes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10 and 0.02% in lanes 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12. The experiments were done in duplicates and the right panel shows reproducibility. The data show the averages and standard deviations including both sets. (C) The third in vitro replication assay contained a partially purified tombusvirus replicase preparation, a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled nucleotides and was programmed with TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA. Note that the repRNA can only produce the complementary (minus-stranded RNA) product in this assay. (D) The fourth in vitro replication assay was similar to that described in panel C, except (2)-stranded repRNA was used to generate (+)-stranded RNA products.

Under these conditions, the TBSV replicase can be successfully assembled in vitro and accordingly, replication of TBSV (+)repRNA was detected in the in vitro replication assay in the presence of the control DMSO (Fig. 2B , lanes 3-4 and 7-8). Interestingly, pre-treatment of the membrane fraction with CPZ led to 3-fold decrease in the TBSV replicase activity in vitro (Fig. 2B , lanes 1-2 and 9-10), whereas pre-treatment with QC had less than 20% inhibitory effect (lanes 5-6 and 11-12). These results demonstrated that pre-treatment of the membrane with CPZ inhibits the subsequent assembly of the TBSV replicase complex.",

When programmed with (+)repRNA template, the activity of the solubilized and partially purified tombusvirus replicase was reduced to 23% by QC treatment (Fig. 2C , lanes 3, 8, 9) , whereas CPZ had only minor effect (lanes 2, 4, 5) when compared with the DMSO treated sample (lanes 1, 6, 7). On the other hand, neither compounds inhibited the activity of the solubilized and partially purified tombusvirus replicase programmed with a (2)repRNA template (Fig. 2D , lanes 2-3 and 5-6). Based on these data, we suggest that QC can selectively inhibit minus-strand synthesis, whereas the plus-strand synthesis is unaffected. On the other hand, CPZ does not seem to inhibit (2) or (+)-strand synthesis significantly by the tombusvirus replicase in vitro.",

            "text": "Previous works defined that binding of p33 replication protein to an internal recognition element, termed p33RE, which consist of a CNC mismatch within an internal stem-loop structure RII(+)-SL, is absolutely essential for TBSV replication in plants, plant protoplasts, in yeast cells and in the authentic in vitro TBSV replication system [11, 13, 32] . The binding of p33 to RII(+)-SL is required for template selection, the recruitment of the viral RNA for replication and for assembly of the active replicase complex. To test if binding of p33 to RII(+)-SL is affected by CPZ and QC, we performed in vitro gel-shift experiments with purified components. This assay is suitable to obtain information on binding of p33 to the viral RNA, which is relevant for in vivo TBSV RNA recruitment activity of p33 [13] . We found that QC strongly inhibited p33-RII(+)-SL interaction in vitro (Fig. 3B , lanes 1-4 versus 5-8), whereas the effect of CPZ was less pronounced at high p33 concentrations (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-4) . Altogether, these in vitro binding experiments suggest that QC can strongly interfere with binding of p33 to the TBSV (+)RNA, thus inhibiting the recruitment of (+)repRNA into replication, whereas the effect of CPZ on the interaction might only be effective at lower p33 concentrations (e.g., in the beginning of infection).",

When capped and polyadenylated mRNA for p33 (similar to that expressed in yeast from plasmid to support TBSV replication) [16] was used, then we did not observe any major inhibitory effect by CPZ and QC (Fig. 4A , lanes 3-6).

The reduced level of viral RNA recruitment by p33 caused by QC is expected to lead to low level of replicase assembly, which requires the viral RNA component [14, 32, 53] . QC also inhibited minus-strand synthesis, but not (+)-strand synthesis, suggesting that QC selectively interacts with the viral (+)RNA template. Indeed, the RNA binding feature of QC has been demonstrated before including GAAA tetraloop [54] , various base-paired RNAs [55] , A-form and H(L)-form of poly(rC)poly(rG) [56] , and single-stranded poly(A) [57] . In addition to the above steps, QC also inhibited the translation of TBSV genomic RNA, which is uncapped and nonpolyadenylated. This inhibition was specific, since QC did not inhibit the translation of the capped/polyadenylated p33 mRNA in the wheat germ assay (Fig. 4) . Altogether, although QC can inhibit various steps during the infectious cycle of TBSV (Fig. 8) , it is possible that most or all of these inhibitory effects are due to the likely ability of QC to bind to viral RNA and inhibit protein -RNA interactions essential for TBSV replication.",

We found that CPZ reduced drastically the in vitro activity of the TBSV replicase at the early time points, but CPZ had only weak inhibitory effect on binding of p33 to (+)RNA. In addition, CPZ did not inhibit the translation of TBSV gRNA. Also, CPZ did not inhibit (2) or (+)strand synthesis in an assay with the solubilized/ purified tombusvirus replicase (Fig. 2C-D) . In vitro replication of the TBSV repRNA was reduced only moderately by CPZ when used at a late (60 min) time point (Fig. 2A) , arguing that once most of the replicase complexes have been assembled (between 0-60 min), then it becomes less sensitive to the presence of CPZ. Based on these data, it is likely that CPZ inhibits the assembly of the TBSV replicase, which occurs after translation and template selection/recruitment of the viral (+)RNA (Fig. 8) . Albeit the assembly process is not yet completely understood for tombusviruses or other (+)-strand RNA viruses, it is likely that multiple viral protein -host protein and viral RNA -protein interactions as well as protein -subcellular membrane interactions have to take place for successful replicase assembly [24, 58] . Although CPZ could affect many of the above interactions, we obtained some evidence that interactions of the above factors with the subcellular membranes might be affected by the CPZ treatment (Fig. 2B) . This is based on pre-treatment of the membrane fraction of the yeast cell-free extract with CPZ, followed by thorough washing of the membrane to remove unbound chemicals prior to the addition of the viral RNA template, the viral replication proteins, and the cytosolic (soluble) fraction of the cell-free extract. The pretreatment of the membrane fraction with CPZ has led to reduced level of TBSV replication in vitro (Fig. 2B) . Since CPZ binds rapidly to phospholipid bilayers and disturbs the molecular ordering of phospholipids [33] and CPZ is also known to affect the bending of the membrane lipids by favoring outward bending of membranes, we propose that CPZ could inhibit the assembly of the replicase complex and thus, TBSV replication via altering the features of intracellular membranes. Indeed, CPZ, when inserted into lipid bilayers, has been shown to induce spontaneously positive curvatures, and inhibit the formation of surfaces with negative curvature [59] . However, replication and the assembly of the replicase of some RNA viruses needs bending of the membranes in inward direction to assemble viral-induced spherules, where replication takes place [60, 61] . So, the opposing bending effect of CPZ and viral replication proteins during the replicase assembly might lead to reduced efficiency of viral replicase assembly. However, we cannot rule out that CPZ could bind to some membrane proteins present in the membrane fraction of the cell extract, which could also lead to a decrease in viral replicase assembly.",

The parallelism with the situation observed here (QC having a role through a direct interaction with RNA, CPZ having a more indirect role involving its capacity to interfere with cell membrane) is particularly noticeable. The analysis of the effect on plant viruses of other antiprion compounds also able to interfere with RPFA and RNA is therefore of interest and will be the subject of future studies.",

(A) The in vitro band-shift assay included the radiolabeled RII(+)-SL sequence, which is present within the p92 ORF in the TBSV gRNA, and 1.0, 0.4, 0.2 or 0.1 mg of purified recombinant p33C as well as CPZ (50 mM) or DMSO (0.01% final concentration). p33C is a soluble, N-terminally truncated version of p33 (contains the RNA-binding domain as well) fused to MBP. Purified recombinant MBP was used as a negative control. The binding was analyzed in 5% nondenaturing PAGE. The bound RNA in the DMSO control (lane 8) was chosen as 100%. Quantitation showed that the free RNA negatively correlated with the bound RNA.
