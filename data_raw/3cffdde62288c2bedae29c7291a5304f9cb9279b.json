However, no exhaustive analysis was performed to understand its evolution in the prospect of codon usage pattern. Here, we performed a deep codon usage analysis of PCV3. PCV3 sequences were classified into two clades: PCV3a and PCV3b, confirmed by principal component analysis. Additionally, the degree of codon usage bias of PCV3 was slightly low as inferred from the analysis of the effective number of codons. The codon usage pattern was mainly affected by natural selection, but there was a coeffect of mutation pressure and dinucleotide frequency. Moreover, based on similarity index analysis, codon adaptation index analysis and relative codon deoptimization index analysis, we found that PCV3 might pose a potential risk to public health though with unknow pathogenicity. In conclusion, this work reinforces the systematic understanding of the evolution of PCV3, which was reflected by the codon usage patterns and fitness of this novel emergent virus.",

ORF1 encodes the replication-associated protein (Rep) and ORF2 encodes the capsid (Cap) protein [8] . It is noteworthy that in less than two years there were extensive reports on the detection of PCV3 in many countries including the USA, China, Brazil, Italy, Korea, Thailand, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Poland [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Several studies have documented the species-specific phenomenon of codon usage bias [22] [23] [24] [25] , which refers to the preferential use of certain synonymous codons [26] . Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that can influence codon usage patterns. These include mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication, selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . When the size of the viral genome and other viral features, such as its dependence on the host machinery for key processes (including replication, protein synthesis and transmission) are compared to those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay between the codon usage of the virus and that of its host is expected to affect the overall viral survival, fitness, evasion of the host immune system and evolution [29, 32] . Previous studies showed that the codon usage bias of PCV was low, while mutation pressure plays a key role in shaping the codon usage bias of PCV1, mutation pressure and natural selection contribute equally to the codon usage bias of PCV2 [33] .",

We used CAI and RCDI analysis to evaluate host suitability to PCV3. There were significant differences in CAI values among different host species (Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) ( Figure 6 (a)). In particular, Homo sapiens had the CAI value similar to Sus scrofa, and Canis familiaris, with a mean value of 0.7358 \u00b1 0.002, while Rhinolophus ferrumequinum had the lowest with a mean value of 0.5296 \u00b1 0.002 in the analysis of both, all the sequences and different genotypes. On the other hand, the mean RCDI values were 1.34 \u00b1 0.01, 1.25 \u00b1 0.01, 1.31 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.59 \u00b1 0.02 for Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, respectively, regardless of genotypes ( Fig S2) . This indicates that the highest codon deoptimization of PCV3 was towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. A similar trend was identified in the analysis of different genotypes. Interestingly, except for the high RCDI value of Rhinolophus ferrumequinumin in relation to PCV3a-2, the other host species exhibited low codon usage deoptimization. On the other hand, PCV3a-1 had the highest codon usage deoptimization compared to the other genotypes among all hosts apart from PCV3a-2 towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Using SiD analysis, we found that Rhinolophus ferrumequinum had a significantly deeper effect on PCV3 coding sequences, followed by Sus scrofa, Canis familiaris and Homo sapiens ( Figure 6 (b)).",

In this study, we performed a codon usage analysis according to different genotypes and potential host species. As a newly evolved virus, PVC3 detection and epidemiological monitoring are not complete. Therefore, epidemiological investigation, real-time disease monitoring and other measures to prevent PCV3 from spreading among pigs worldwide and to other mammals, is strongly recommended. To date, the most effective method to inhibit transmission is via vaccination. The understanding of codon usage patterns may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines, therefore, the importance of this kind of studies [44] .",

Here, we found that A/G were abundant in coding sequences. Optimal synonymous codons ending in A/T were more abundant than G/C-ended codons. Altogether, this could indicate the existence of codon bias. However, we detected a high ENC value [47] . PCV3 had a lower codon bias than the other two porcine circoviruses. This might be due to the need of the virus to accommodate to the host replication system to replicate efficiency [48] . In this case, the low codon usage bias observed in PCV3 might be necessary to adapt to the natural host, pig, to prevail globally. However, this needs to be confirmed.",

Using neutrality analysis, we found that natural selection constrained the codon usage bias by 87.83% compared to mutation pressure (12.17%) using all PCV3 sequences. When the analysis was performed according to genotype, we found that the influence of natural selection on PCV3a-IM (67.25%) was slightly lower than the other genotypes. The reason for this is not clear, however we hypothesize that it could be due to the instable distribution of PCV3a-IM within the phylogeny.

There were no under-represented dinucleotides in PCV3 while the relative abundance of CpC, GpG and TpT deviated from the normal data and were over-represented. Based on RSCU analysis, synonymous codons harbouring these three dinucleotides occupied most of the prefer used codons, which means dinucleotide compositions played an important role in determining the patterns of codon usage of PCV3, apart from mutation pressure and natural selection. Although CpG was not under-represented, its content was low, which could be associated with the immunostimulatory nature of unmethylated CpGs. The recognition of unmethylated CpG by Toll-like receptor 9 leads to the activation of immune responses and thus, a low CpG content could be beneficial for virus replication [49] . For many viruses, the AT and GC contents are mostly related to the RSCU. We found that T-ended codons were more abundant compared to A/G/C-ended codons. Additionally, there was no difference in the usage of the 18 optimal codons among the different genotypes. However, A was the most abundant nucleotide. It has been suggested that the choice of optimal codons in viruses largely depends on the host [50] . PCV3 exhibited coincident and antagonistic codon usage patterns relative to its host when we contrasted the RSCU pattern of PCV3 to the host species, in agreement with other viruses such as hepatitis A virus [51] . This observed mixed codon usage pattern could be explained by the fact that coincident codons between virus and host are beneficial due to efficient protein translation, while antagonistic codons proper viral protein folding [52] . However, this speculation needs to be further confirmed.",

The degree of codon usage preference was low and dominated mainly by natural selection. We also found evidence supporting the idea that PCV3 might be a potential threat to public health. Importantly, it has been reported that PCV3 infects dogs [37] , increasing the potential risk of cross interspecies transmission and adding exposure of humans, though, currently, with unclear pathogenicity in human host. The findings of this study help us understand the underlying factors associated with PCV3 evolution and host adaption which will greatly serve future PCV3 research.",
