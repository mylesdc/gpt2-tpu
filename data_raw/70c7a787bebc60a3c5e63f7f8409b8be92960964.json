We found that the use of H 3 PW 12 O 40 \u00b713H 2 O acid coupled to microwave irradiation allowed obtaining a high-yielding reaction with a short time. The compound structures were established by 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized compounds exhibited an inhibition of the growth of bacteria and fungi.",

In this work, we took it back by using reflux heating and microwave irradiation to highlight the efficiency of the latter. Thus, 97% of the product yield was obtained in a few minutes under microwave irradiation against 90% after 2 h of the conventional reflux heating method. The 2-phenyl-1,3-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 compound was used for the 2-benzoylamino-Nphenylbenzamide 5a synthesis from its condensation with aniline 4. The reaction was conducted, under microwave irradiation, in solvent-free conditions, using a series of Keggin-type heteropolyacids, HnXM12O40 (abbreviated as XM12, where X = P or Si and M = W or Mo) (Scheme 2).

Results are summarized in Table 1 . 2-Benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide yields (Table 1 ) depended on the nature of both the metal atom (W, Mo) and the heteroatom (P, Si) of HPA. Thus, W-based HPAs were more efficient than Mo-based (72-80% against 56-65% of 5a yield). Phosphorus heteroatoms, which make the HPA more active, unlike siliceous heteroatoms, resulted in a yield of 5a of 80% against 72% for W-based HPAs and 65% against 56% for Mo-based HPAs. The results obtained show that the decrease in yield (PW12 > SiW12 > PMo12 > SiMo12) follows that of the acidity strength [34] . Thus, PW12heteropolyacid was chosenas the catalyst to synthesize a series of 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives 5a-h with substituted anilines 4a-h in the same conditions (Scheme 3). The products are obtained in a few minutes. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The aniline substituent group nature shows a strong impact on the yields. Thus, the presence of electron donating groups led to a yield increase. With methyl and hydroxy groups in C6H4, the yields are 85% and 92%, respectively, against 80% for the phenyl. These groups are beneficial because of their high electron density, induced by the aromatic system unlike, the electron withdrawing group as chloro, which led to a yield decrease from 80% to 78%.

The presence of a second chlorine atom in the aniline also led to a yield decrease from 78% to 65%. Among dichloroanilines, 2,4-dichloro-C 6 H 3 gave the better yield (73% against 65-70%). This decrease is attributed to the group steric effect. Scheme 4 shows a plausible mechanism of the 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide 5a formation in the heteropolyacid presence. The initial step corresponds to the protonation of carbonyl on a Br\u00f8nsted site of HPA favoring the amine attack that leads to the intermediate I 1 . Thelatter is then deprotonated to give another intermediate I 2 and the released proton is then recovered by the HPA. Finally, a proton transfer from the aniline to the amide nitrogen takes place, thus leading to the final product. It is known that the presence of an electron donating group favors the amine basic character.",

Gram-negative bacterial strains, namely Escherichia coli (ATCC-11105) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-9027), and Gram-positive bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538) and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC-6633), were chosen as model bacterial strains, and fungi, namely Candida albicans (ATCC-10231) and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC-16404)). Agar plates, containing 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide products dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (600 \u00b5g/mL) were inoculated uniformly from fresh bacterial culture and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h.

Antifungal screening also revealed that all the tested compounds 5a-h showed a good (+++) inhibition against C. albicans and A. brasiliensis. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of a compound capable of inhibiting the visible growth of bacterial and fungal strains are defined by the value of the MIC that corresponds to its lower concentration. In order to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of the compound 5e against the bacterial strains mentioned above, it was dissolved in DMSO at different concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400 and 600 \u00b5g/mL). The results are summarized in Table 4 . The MIC values found for compound 5e are less than 100 \u00b5g/mL for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, and C. albicans, and they are 100-200 and 300-400 \u00b5g/mL for S. aureus and A. brasiliensis, respectively. The sensitivity of microorganisms, toward tested compounds, was identified in the following manner: no activity (-\u2264 8 mm), slightly active (8 < + < 16 mm), moderately active (16 \u2264 ++ \u2264 20 mm), and highly active (+++ > 20 mm).",

Experiments were carried out in a Pyrex reactor fitted with a condenser. During experiments, the temperature was monitored with an external infrared thermometer, Flashpoint FZ400 (Shenzhen Jumaoyuan Science and Technology CO., LTD, Guangdong, China). Our modifications to a domestic microwave oven, adopted since 1992, are similar to those described, currently, for microwave chemistry experiments [39] . In a typical design, a hole was drilled for a condenser tube in the oven top. External steel tube of the same diameter (~12 cm long) was welded to the hole in order to eliminate possible microwave leakage. The microwave equipment operates within the safety limits prescribed: the accepted limit on the safe stray leakage of the microwave power density is 10 mW/cm 2 at 2450 MHz measured at a 50 mm distance from the equipment (microwave leakage detector). The apparatus has been adapted for laboratory applications with an external reflux condenser, multi-limb vacuum receivers, and a Dean Stark trap. Method II (microwave irradiation): A mixture of anthranilic acid (10 mmol) and benzoyl chloride (10 mmol) and 10 mL of toluene was carried out under microwave irradiation. The power was initially set to 420 W for 5 min, and then it was increased to 510 W for 7 min. A white solid wasobtained. The latter with the acetic anhydride (10 mL) irradiated under microwave at 500 W for 8 min. The obtained solid was washed by the water to eliminate acid. ",
