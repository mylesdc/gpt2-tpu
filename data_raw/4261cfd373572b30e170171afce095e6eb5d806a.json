While mild disease in healthy young adults has also been described [3] , the potential for RSV to cause severe disease in adults was not recognized until reports of outbreaks among older adults residing in long-term care facilities emerged [4, 5] . Subsequently, RSV was shown to cause serious illness among healthy, community-dwelling older adults. A landmark study of high-risk and community-dwelling adults aged \u226565 years and high-risk adults in the United States detected RSV infection in 3%-7% of healthy, community-dwelling older adults, 4%-10% of high-risk adults, and 16% of adults hospitalized with cardiopulmonary infections [6] . Furthermore, RSV infection was estimated to result in approximately 177 000 hospitalizations, 10 000 to 14 000 deaths, and more than $1 billion dollars in healthcare costs per year in the United States, mostly among older adults [6, 7] . Nonetheless, RSV remains clinically underrecognized by most healthcare providers as a cause of severe respiratory disease in adults [7] [8] [9] .",

Appreciation of the potential for RSV infection to cause serious illness similar to that caused by influenza will likely trigger more testing for RSV in addition to testing for influenza and direct therapy to the identified etiology in patients as newer agents become available. In addition, recent data on the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of older adults hospitalized with RSV are critical to the evaluation of more than 50 RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals currently under development prior to their introduction [11] . While a number of important studies have described the burden and clinical characteristics of RSV and influenza disease in hospitalized older adults, most of these studies were conducted at least a decade ago [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, longterm mortality has not been analyzed previously. Therefore, we evaluated a large cohort of adults aged \u226560 years hospitalized with RSV or influenza A/B infection during 5 consecutive seasons. Demographics, prehospitalization characteristics, hospital utilization, and clinical outcomes, including long-term mortality, were assessed and compared between adults with RSV infection and those with influenza virus infection.",

The demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely mirrors the racially and sociodemographically diverse Southern California population and the California census population; more than 99% are community dwelling [16] . As KPSC is a prepaid healthcare system, there is a very strong motivation for members to use services internally. Furthermore, reimbursement by KPSC for outside care requires that claims be submitted with documentation of the care provided; claims are subsequently entered into the administrative data systems.

All samples were submitted to a single, centralized KPSC laboratory for processing.

If there were patients with multiple hospitalizations who met the above criteria (eg, had a positive RSV or influenza A/B test on 2 separate hospitalization encounters), the first RSV or first influenza hospitalization was kept for the RSV or influenza cohort, respectively. For the purpose of statistical comparison, independent samples of RSV and influenza cohorts were defined. Twenty-five individuals with both a positive RSV test and a positive influenza test during different hospitalizations during the study period were kept in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort.

There was a higher proportion of females in the RSV cohort than in the influenza cohort (60.5% vs 50.3% female; P < .001). Race/ethnicity distributions were similar between the RSV and the influenza cohorts. A higher proportion of RSV patients than influenza patients had received influenza vaccine in the 1 year prior to admission (83.1% vs 73.1%; P < .001). Smoking status and body mass index were similar between cohorts. The prevalence of several comorbidities was significantly different between patients hospitalized with RSV and those with influenza, including congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P < .001), diabetes (38.9% vs 44.6%; P = .012), COPD/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006), asthma (26.0% vs 18.6%; P < .001), any solid cancer (11.2% vs 8.0%; P = .016), and leukemia (1.9% vs 0.9%; P = .050). Use of any antiviral therapy, including oseltamivir, within 14 days prior to admission was not common but was more prevalent in the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort (4.3% vs 2.7%; P = .034 for any antiviral medication and 2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .026 for oseltamivir; data not shown).",

            "text": "Consistent with earlier reports, we found that adults hospitalized with RSV were slightly older and had greater frequency of baseline comorbidities, particularly cardiopulmonary disease, than those hospitalized with influenza virus infection [6, 12, 14] . However, after adjustment for comorbidities, we found that hospitalization outcomes among older adults hospitalized with RSV were either comparable to or significantly worse than they were among those hospitalized with influenza. While previous studies found similar hospital length of stay among older adults hospitalized with RSV or with influenza [6, 14] , we found that longer hospitalizations (length of stay \u22657 days) occurred more often among the RSV cohort than they did in the influenza cohort. This may reflect increased use of antiviral therapies in recent years that ameliorate influenza but not RSV disease [18] or differences in clinical recovery associated with a more pronounced RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract syndrome. We also found that pulmonary complications and findings, including pneumonia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and greater need for oxygen supplementation, and exacerbation of asthma and of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema were significantly greater among the RSV cohort after adjustment for potential confounders. These findings are similar to those of Lee et al. who reported that hospitalized adults with RSV in Hong Kong had a greater frequency of lower respiratory complications than those with influenza [14] . While increased baseline cardiopulmonary disease in the RSV cohort likely increased their risk of pulmonary complications, including exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease and asthma, these differences were observed after adjustment for comorbidities, including baseline cardiopulmonary disease. Discharge to hospice and skilled nursing facilities was similar in the RSV and influenza cohorts, but a greater proportion of the RSV cohort required home health services after discharge. Finally, similar to previous findings [6, 14] , short-term mortality for patients infected with RSV was similar to that of patients infected with influenza. However, longer-term survival among the RSV cohort, which has not been reported previously, was significantly worse than that of the influenza cohort. The impact of RSV on long-term survival may be a reflection of the potential for RSV to drive chronic inflammation associated with persistent, sometimes progressive, pulmonary disease, although the mechanism for this is not clear [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition to confirming the severe impact of annual influenza epidemics, our findings also underscore the substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization associated with RSV infection in the expanding population of older adults and the need for RSV vaccines and antivirals. Interestingly, influenza vaccine uptake within 1 year of admission was higher among the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort while receipt of pneumococcal vaccine was similar. This may reflect, in part, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza infections and is unlikely due to differential vaccine acceptance. On the other hand, the increased use of oseltamivir within 14 days prior to hospitalization among older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza may reflect presumed influenza infection and delay in diagnosis of RSV infection. Conversely, decreased in-hospital use of antiviral therapy among the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort likely reflects the discontinuation of oseltamivir after identification of RSV and initiation of oseltamivir after identification of influenza. The greater use of antibiotics and systemic and inhaled steroids in the RSV cohort during their hospitalizations may mirror the higher frequency of pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic lung disease and asthma among older hospitalized adults with RSV infection than those with influenza infection.",

This is understandable since in many settings, respiratory pathogen testing is limited to influenza virus testing, so that noninfluenza pathogens, including RSV, have not been recognized as possible etiologies of serious respiratory illness similar to that caused by influenza. In addition, even in settings in which multiplex pathogen testing is used, local circulation of influenza virus in the community and clinical suspicion for influenza may drive testing patterns among hospitalized older adults and, thus, may underestimate the relative frequency of other viral respiratory pathogens, including RSV, which may have either nonoverlapping or broader periods of circulation in the same community. Therefore, the number of hospitalizations with RSV or with influenza detected in this study may not reflect the relative incidences of each pathogen over the study period since RSV infections that occur during intervals when influenza virus is less prevalent are less likely to be detected.",
