            "text": "While outbreaks of emerging zoonoses, such as Ebola virus disease, galvanize the world's attention, it is the endemic zoonoses that still inflict the much greater burden of mortality and morbidity. In a recent review exploring the associations between zoonoses and poverty, a ranking of 'important' zoonoses was made on the basis of human mortality, human morbidity, impact on the livestock sector, amenability to agriculture-based control, and emergence or severity of disease in people [1] . The 13 top-ranked zoonoses were responsible for 2.2 million human deaths and 2.4 billion cases of illness every year [1] . Notwithstanding the devastating impacts of the recent West African Ebola disease epidemic, it is salutary to note that, every year, rabies and leptospirosis are estimated to cause five times as many human deaths, with an estimated 59 000 people dying from each of these diseases annually [2, 3] . Other endemic zoonoses may well have impacts of comparable magnitude [1] , but in many cases, we lack the data to define and demonstrate these impacts fully.",

First, for most endemic zoonoses, there is little potential for sustained transmission in human populations and therefore little risk of transboundary spread to high-income countries through human movements and contacts. Second, measures for the prevention, treatment and control of endemic zoonoses are often available to protect people and animals in high-income countries and the disease burden is much less substantial than in neglected communities. These factors reduce immediate awareness and concern about disease risk at international level, which in turn impacts on the perceived need to prioritize investments for disease control and prevention in low-income settings.",

Many endemic zoonoses present with non-specific clinical signs in both people and animals and are easy to misdiagnose on clinical grounds [4] .

Well-validated point-of-care diagnostic tests are rarely available, and diagnosis of chronic stages or sequelae of infections is often difficult. The pattern of under-recognition of zoonoses persists, despite a growing body of evidence that many zoonoses are important causes of common human disease syndromes, such as undifferentiated fever, in both Africa and Asia [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

There are several reasons why it is the rural poor who are most vulnerable to exposure, infection and the downstream consequences of endemic zoonoses [13, 14, 17] : (i) because close contact with animals and traditional food consumption practices heighten exposure risks; (ii) because zoonotic diseases often affect livestock production, so it is people in poor livestock-dependent communities who are highly vulnerable to the impacts of zoonoses on livelihoods, food security and wellbeing; (iii) because the rural poor generally have limited access to high-quality human and animal health services for clinical care and treatment of illness; and (iv) because there are numerous social, political and economic issues that affect the ability of individuals to act in particular ways (individual agency), so the poor often have limited capacity to mitigate or manage disease risks. Figure 1 illustrates those countries in Africa, particularly in East and West Africa, where risks and vulnerabilities are likely to be particularly intense, characterized by areas where there is convergence of high livestock and domestic dog densities, a high proportion of the population engaged in agriculture and poor provision of health services.",

Several international health initiatives address zoonoses, but many of these, including the International Health Regulations [20] and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) [21] , focus primarily on emerging zoonoses that threaten the broader global community. The case has been made that a global surveillance system established for emerging zoonotic diseases could be readily improvised to address endemic diseases [22] . However, even with substantial investments made during outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, laboratory diagnostic capacity remains limited and concentrated in a few cities, and there remains a severe shortage of health professionals and workers, particularly in rural areas [23] . Thus, despite large-scale investments in surveillance for diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, fewer than 20% of United Nations member states are able to effectively implement the International Health Regulations [24] . Once the immediate threat of an emerging disease has passed, and crisis funding and donor support removed, it may be difficult for governments in low-income countries to maintain support for the staff, skills and laboratory infrastructure needed to detect and respond to rare emerging disease outbreaks that are of little day-to-day concern to their populations.",

For example, following a prioritization exercise that was conducted in Ethiopia, rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and echinococcus were identified as the five zoonoses of greatest concern in Ethiopia, and recommendations were made for strengthening intersectoral surveillance and interventions against these diseases, with regular review to address new emerging zoonotic disease threats [26] .

Goal 3 further combines a commitment to strengthening capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks (Target 3.d) with a target of achieving universal health coverage and access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all (Target 3.8) [16] .

However, among several important lessons learned, the West Africa epidemic of Ebola virus disease highlighted the critical need for enhancing community trust, engagement and ownership [23, 29] . Intersectoral governance mechanisms have often been established in response to crises to address specific risks. However, trust between stakeholders and communities to support and build effective health systems cannot be spontaneously generated. Trust is built and is founded on experience, and can be developed through planned and regular interactions of all stakeholders, including representatives of heterogeneous communities, to address endemic zoonotic risks. Sustained investments and efforts to manage endemic zoonoses which deliver public health and livestock production benefits, train people and engage with communities can create a platform upon which relationships and trust can be built for more coordinated emergency responses.",

These previously under-recognised vulnerabilities to disease intersect with socio-economic power relations and other structural factors, which in turn constrain health-seeking behaviour.

Although treatments are available for several endemic zoonoses, it is the disadvantaged and poor who are being 'left behind' when approaches rely on clinical management. However, many endemic zoonoses are entirely or largely preventable through One Health measures targeted at animal or environmental reservoirs and infection sources and these preventive approaches offer several advantages. One Health interventions that effectively reduce the force of infection from the animal or environmental reservoir convey benefits to all who are epidemiologically connected to the source of infection without regard to socioeconomic status-the benefit cannot be 'purchased' or socially distorted to the detriment of the poor. Social factors will always impact on the accessibility of healthcare but interventions targeted to prevent zoonoses at source will help buffer the impacts of these social drivers of inequality in healthcare provision, particularly in rural communities in Africa, where 83% of people are not covered by essential health services [37] and where people are also at greatest risk from endemic zoonoses [1, 14] .",

Human deaths can be prevented by a combination of prompt administration of PEP and mass vaccination of domestic dog reservoirs, but the relative levels of investment in these two arms of prevention are often mismatched. In Asia, for example, the incidence of human rabies cases is much higher than in Latin America, despite the elevated levels of per capita expenditure on human PEP provision in Asia (figure 2). Here, even though health sector expenditure on PEP is very high (with US$ 1.3 billion of direct costs spent annually on PEP in Asia), poor people are still dying from rabies due to lack of access to health services with PEP. Conversely, many doses of PEP are given to animal-bite victims who will have had no rabies exposure, often in relatively affluent urban areas. By contrast, measures to prevent rabies at source (i.e. through rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 372: 20160168 mass dog vaccination) protect both the rich and the poor, casting a wider 'safety net' than can be achieved by focusing on management of human exposures alone and cost considerably less. In Latin America, for example, even modest investments in mass dog vaccination (US$ 61 million per year, representing approximately 20% total expenditure on rabies prevention) [2] have been highly effective in preventing human rabies deaths, with the region on the brink of eliminating dog rabies as a human health problem [43] .",

            "text": "Several livestock zoonoses-brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever and rickettsioses-which are known to occur across Africa [44 -48] have been identified as causes of febrile illness in both adults and children in East and West Africa and southeast Asia [6, 7, 9, 11, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Illnesses caused by these zoonotic pathogens are often difficult to diagnose and are frequently misdiagnosed: the clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and easily mistaken for malaria [6] ; laboratory confirmatory tests are rarely available; healthcare provider awareness is generally low [5] ; and patients often present at hospital only in the later stages of infection when diagnostic confirmation is much more challenging. As malaria transmission declines in many parts of Africa [51, 55] , the importance of zoonoses as causes of non-malaria febrile illness is becoming more apparent. For example, in a study involving 870 patients hospitalized with fever in northern Tanzania [6] , bacterial zoonoses, which were not initially considered by clinicians in any cases, were confirmed as a cause of disease in 26.2% of cases. Malaria, although clinically diagnosed in the majority of cases (60.7%), was confirmed as the cause of fever in only very few (1.6%). While the relative contribution of different zoonoses to the aetiology of febrile illness varies by location, livestock-associated zoonoses have been consistently identified in several recent studies from East Africa. For example, leptospirosis and Q fever were confirmed in a small number of cases of systemic febrile infections in children in one outpatient study in Tanzania [51] , and in a much higher proportion of febrile children in an outpatient study from a different region, also in Tanzania (with 11.6% patients diagnosed with presumptive acute leptospirosis, 13% with confirmed leptospirosis and 22.4% with presumptive brucellosis) [11] .",

While these tests are urgently needed, challenges are still likely to remain in application and interpretation of diagnostic test results. Many patients will experience delays in reaching health facilities [56] and even with the best tests, pathogen detection in clinical samples can be very difficult. A further concern relates to the apparently high levels of prior antimicrobial use among febrile patients presenting to health facilities, which may compromise capacity to detect some bacterial infections. In an analysis of patients presenting with acute leptospirosis in Tanzania, urinary antibacterial activity was detected by bioassay in 31 (64.6%) of 48 cases, and is likely to have contributed to the inability of PCR diagnostic tests to detect infection in either plasma or urine samples at the time of presentation [57] .",

Several vaccines exist and are available to prevent many of the widely occurring livestock-associated zoonoses, and although they have been adopted in more intensive farming systems in high-and middle-income countries, they are not widely used in Africa or other low-income contexts. Livestock vaccination against brucellosis and leptospirosis has been effective in reducing the burden of disease in many parts of the world. Vaccination of sheep and goats is the mainstay of current national brucellosis control and elimination strategies that are being implemented across Eastern Europe and Central Asia [60] , with substantial declines in small ruminant and human disease documented in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia and vaccinated regions of Tajikistan [60] . In some countries where small ruminant vaccination has been implemented, bovine brucellosis has also been reduced (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan), indicating that a greater proportion of bovine brucellosis is attributable to Brucella melitensis infection than is commonly considered [60] . These outcomes are consistent with findings from Tanzania that implicate sheep and goats as the likely source of infection in both people and cattle [61] . In Mongolia, small ruminant vaccination has also been shown to be a highly cost-effective strategy when considering both human health benefits and livestock production gains [62] .",

For example, uptake may be compromised if animals identified for vaccination under epidemiologically optimal strategies are not the same as those considered by owners as the most valuable (e.g. in terms of traction power, food provision or social value). Household-level decisions will also need to be made as to how to balance potential costs for healthcare and treatment against recurring costs of preventive measures. These decisions will be particularly difficult for interventions directed at disease syndromes with multiple aetiologies, such as febrile illness, when the links between animal infection and human disease may be poorly appreciated, and the impact of any single intervention will only reduce a proportion of the overall burden of the disease syndrome (box 1).",

This poses several challenges for interventions based on livestock vaccination, which tend to focus on economic benefits from improved livestock productivity. National campaigns and government investment in livestock disease control are usually limited to notifiable and transboundary livestock diseases, and most countries lack coordinated programmes for large-scale control of endemic diseases, including many zoonoses [67] . Even where attention is focused on control of animal diseases for improving public health and rural development, current policies emphasize private sector involvement, with attention being given to innovative financing mechanisms, such as Development Impact Bonds [73] , as well as product and market development to facilitate and support uptake by smallholder farmers [74] . However, if One Health interventions have to be sustained only or largely by direct payments from animal owners, they are unlikely to help overcome existing inequalities that disadvantage the rural poor in relation to affordability or access to health services. To achieve successful control of many zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis) [70] and the populationlevel benefits that would address existing health inequalities, careful consideration clearly needs to be given to the balance rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil.

            "text": "To achieve population-level benefits, particular care will be needed to avoid suboptimal vaccination outcomes, both in terms of vaccination coverage and completeness. For effective control of rabies, for example, it is increasingly clear that sustained, contiguous and large-scale programmes are needed, as even small pockets of low vaccination coverage (involving less than 0.5% of the dog population) can significantly hamper progress [75] . Even where the cost-effectiveness of One Health strategies has been demonstrated, for example, in relation to mass rabies vaccination of dogs in Africa [76, 77] , sheep and goat vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia [62] and control of human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda [13] , barriers remain to scaling-up. Increasing attention is being paid to opportunities for integrating platforms for delivery of health interventions, with international health agencies focusing on the importance of strengthening health systems to achieve equitable delivery of health services, rather than developing multiple vertical programmes for specific diseases [78] . It is recognized that establishing independent delivery efforts for specific diseases can lead to fragmentation, and that coordination across sectors is needed to strengthen health systems. In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration. Adopting One Health approaches, the project aims to break down traditional barriers that exist between veterinary and human health interventions, and build on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) in order to achieve cost savings, develop synergies and improve the effectiveness of both interventions. Further opportunities to establish co-delivery across a range of health interventions exist, not only for integrating control measures against several different zoonoses [73] , but also for cross-linkages with public health interventions, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes, and joint delivery of public health and veterinary services, particularly in remote or nomadic rural communities [79] .",

Brucellosis has been effectively controlled in many countries through strategies that include livestock vaccination, test-and-slaughter and sanitation measures. However, these have yet to be widely deployed in many African countries or other LMICs. Live attenuated vaccines including Brucella abortus strains (S19 and RB51) in cattle and B. melitensis Rev 1 in sheep and goats have been used successfully, but none of the current vaccines can protect all host species against all Brucella species.

In contrast to mass dog vaccination strategies against rabies, which result in rapid, tangible benefits that are recognized by communities (i.e. the distinctive and visible cases of rabies disappear), control of brucellosis may be less readily appreciable. Even if successful, cases of fever in people and livestock abortion will still occur, and the interval between the intervention and any impact is likely to be prolonged.
