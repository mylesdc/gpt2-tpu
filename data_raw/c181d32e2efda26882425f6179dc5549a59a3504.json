Comparing with existing methods, our ADLD based method is proved to be effective in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences and have the merits of good intuition, visuality, and simplicity. The examinations of the similarities/dissimilarities for both the 16 different ND5 proteins and the 29 different spike proteins illustrate the utility of our ADLD based approach.",

Protein sequences are to some degree similar to DNA sequences, which are composed of different units. Thus the graphical representation methods can be extended to describe protein sequences obviously.",

For example, Feng and Zhang [25] suggested Zp-curve based on the hydrophobicity and charged properties of amino acid residues along the primary sequence. Randi\u0107 et al. [26] introduced a graphical representation of protein sequences based on a graphical representation of triplets of DNA in which the interior of a square or a tetrahedron is utilized to accommodate 64 sites for the 64 codons. Bai and Wang [27] derived a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on nucleotide triplet codons. Yao et al. [28] outlined a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on two classifications of amino acids. Abo el Maaty et al. [29] proposed a novel unique 3D graphical representation of protein sequences based on three physicochemical properties of amino acid side chains. Abo-Elkhier introduced a 3D graphical representation of protein sequence based on a right cone of a unit base and unit height on protein sequences interfaces [30] . El-Lakkani and El-Sherif [31] proposed a graphical representation of protein sequence to help similarity analysis of protein sequences based on 2D and 3D amino acid adjacency matrices. Ma et al. [32] introduced a family of Iterated Function Systems (IFS) to outline a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences.",

Up to now, there are many kinds of algorithms having been implemented for sequence alignment [34] [35] [36] [37] . These methods are usually efficient but complex and time consuming. Comparing with the alignment methods, existing graphical representation methods can also display the inner structure of the protein sequences and can be utilized to find the similarity/dissimilarity more visible according to their graphics. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for analyzing the similarity/dissimilarity by combining the idea of the sequence alignment and the graphical representation methods to some degree avoid the weakness of both of these two methods.",

Therefore, in order to overcome the main drawbacks of existing methods, in this paper, a novel graphical representation of protein sequences called ADLD (Alignment Diagonal Line Diagram) is introduced based on PCA, and then a new ADLD based method is proposed and utilized to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences. And, in addition, to validate the effectiveness of our ADLD based method, we adopt it to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of both the 16 different ND5 proteins and the 29 different spike proteins, respectively, which are widely used as the test data [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The analysis results show that our method is not only visual, intuitional, and effective in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences but also quite simple, since there are no high dimensional matrixes required to be constructed.",

To validate the performances of the new method, we select two groups of well-known protein sequences as examples, and, additionally, in order to observe the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences more intuitively, we construct the phylogenetic trees of protein sequences. The results show that our ADLDs based method not only has good performances and effects in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences but also does not require complex computation, since there are no high dimensional matrixes required. Therefore, it means that our ADLDs based method can work well in the analysis of protein sequences.",
