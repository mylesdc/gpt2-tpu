            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increased uptake of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine have led to declines in fatal outcomes due to lower respiratory infections, from 3.4 million deaths worldwide in 1990 to 2.8 million in 2010. [1] However, SARI is associated with a large number of different viral and bacterial agents, notably influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), adenoviruses (AV), and rhinoviruses. [1] The complex interrelationships between the prevalent pathogens that cause SARI are not well understood. [2] Influenza, in particular, is a very common and sometimes serious infectious disease, with an epidemiological picture marked by seasonal peaks in winter months and antigenic drift and shift, which potentiate local and regional outbreaks and global pandemics. A community influenza burden assessment in England found that approximately 18% of the unvaccinated population became infected with influenza A or B viruses each season during 2006-2011. [3] Although three-quarters of the infections in this population were asymptomatic, [3] symptoms and complications are often more severe among well recognized high-risk groups. For example, the hospitalization rate due to respiratory illness during an influenza season in Japan was 4.3 times higher among pregnant women than among those who were not pregnant. [4] Routine monitoring of influenza A/B virus activity is the foundation for preparedness and response to the virus and its pandemic potential. Special studies are not sufficient to provide timely and actionable information to guide response. In 2006, WHO and other organizations evaluated the influenza A pandemic response and preparedness capacity in the country of Georgia, among other countries. The review found deficiencies in the local epidemiological and laboratory capacity. [5] In response, a surveillance system for SARI was established to provide improved epidemiologic monitoring of influenza and other respiratory disease within the country of Georgia. [6] According to previously modeled estimates regarding burden of SARI among children 0-4 years in Georgia, [7] influenza A virus and RSV are associated with 32% and 54% of all acute lower respiratory illnesses, respectively. Epidemiologic characterization of influenza among highrisk groups in Georgia has not been previously reported in the literature. This study aimed to characterize the seasonality and epidemiology of SARI in the country of Georgia over two influenza seasons (2015-2016 and 2016-2017) , to describe the etiological and clinical patterns observed, and to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness using a case-test negative design.",

[8] Hospitalized patients with SARI provided demographic information, including age, sex, and residence through questionnaires. The surveillance system also collects patients' self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccination within the past year in response to the question, \"Are you vaccinated against influenza?\" Participants who responded affirmatively were subsequently questioned about when they were vaccinated, and were only recorded as having received the vaccine if it was received specifically for the on-going season. Based on date of sampling and enrollment into the study, cases of SARI captured in the sentinel surveillance system between September 29, 2015, and March 15, 2017, were included in this present manuscript.",

Routine monitoring of infectious etiologies associated with SARI at the local-level is critical for signaling epidemiologic and etiologic trends that may differ from one country to another. For example, a study of SARI patients in a number of countries of eastern Europe and western and central Asia found that the proportion of cases positive for influenza varied widely between country and season, from 2.1% in Armenia in 2011-2012 to 100% in Albania in 2009-2010. [10] And in the United States, surveillance of adults [11] and children [12] have been used to calculate the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia and the relative burden of different pathogens. The early detection of unusual or divergent activity from one country to another via the sentinel surveillance system can better prepare a country for emergency response needs and inform routine programmatic actions. During 2015-2017 in Georgia, the predominant causes of SARI varied seasonally and depending on the month were influenza A/B, RSV and rhinovirus, although other virusescoronavirus, parainfluenzavirus, adenovirus-were also present. The most serious clinical symptoms were found in those infected with influenza A and human metapneumovirus. A cross-country risk assessment of SARI activity among European countries during the 2015-2016 found a predominance of influenza A circulation in the region, with an uptick in severe disease in the earliest parts of the season, [13] which aligns with the patterns captured by the surveillance system in Georgia. While the distribution of infectious etiologies could change within and between seasons due to increased uptake of PCV, Hib and seasonal influenza vaccination, there was no evidence that circulating influenza viruses changed antigenically compared to the influenza vaccine virus for the same season. [13] Another important aim of strengthening the SARI sentinel surveillance in the country of Georgia is to track the occurrence of SARI among high-risk groups. From 2015-2017, onefifth of SARI cases had underlying comorbidities with cardiovascular disease observed in 10% of all SARI cases. The proportion of cardiovascular related comorbidities among influenza positive SARI cases was higher than all-cause SARI cases. Another special study on influenza mortality in Georgia conducted between 2009-2011 found that diagnosed coronary heart disease was commonly associated with fatal outcomes among influenza positive SARI cases (19% for type A, 68% for type B). [14] Individuals with cardiovascular disease could be targets for influenza vaccination programs in the future.",

A study of pediatric influenza cases from the 2010-11 influenza season in Georgia also found low vaccination coverage-there being no case with a prior vaccination. [16] The lack of strong physician recommendations for influenza vaccination to the general population or even high risk groups are likely responsible for poor vaccine uptake. For example, a recent study found that only 43% of obstetrician-gynecologists in Georgia have recommended influenza vaccine to pregnant women, and only 18% reported vaccinating pregnant patients in the last influenza season. [17] Misinformation or knowledge gaps may also be at the root of hesitant recommendations from the healthcare worker community. For instance, one study of hospital-based physicians and nurses found that few were able to correctly identify influenza as the virus associated with H5N1 outbreaks in neighboring countries. [18] Analysis of risk factors associated with severe outcomes and continued monitoring of the etiologic nature of SARI occurrence in Georgia should provide an important evidence basis to help healthcare workers target high-risk groups and bolster seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in the population.",

            "text": "A total of 1,624 patients with SARI were identified by the sentinel surveillance system from September 29, 2015, toMarch 15, 2017 (Table 1). More SARI cases were <1 year (22%; 356/ 1624) or 1-4 years of age (28%; 449/1624) than in other age groups. Only 9% (150/1624) of cases were among persons !65 years. Slightly more cases were male (54%; 877/1624) than female, and 3% (52/1624) were pregnant women. Comorbidities were found in 19% (315/ 1624) of the SARI cases, the most common being cardiovascular disease (10%; 158/1624), diabetes (4%; 68/1624), respiratory disease (4%; 66/1624), and neurological disease (4%; 61/1624). Many SARI patients received clinical care such as hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU) (37%; 606/1624), artificial ventilation (12%; 189/1624), or antiviral treatment (21%; 338/ 1624). Few deaths (1%; 14/1624) were recorded among the SARI cases. Overall, 14% (222/1624) of individuals were co-infected with at least two pathogens. The most common pathogens characterized by co-infection were: RSV (39%, 87/222), rhinovirus (38%; 84/222), and influenza (20%; 44/222 [29 A/H1pdm09, 9 A/H3, and 6 B]). Compared to the entire population of SARI cases, co-infected individuals tended to be younger with 32% (71/222) aged <1 year and 43% (95/222) aged 1-4 years, compared to 22% (356/1624) and 28% (449/1624), respectively, for all SARI cases. Among the co-infected children 4 years 31% (69/222) were hospitalized in the ICU, compared to 37% (606/1624) hospitalized overall, and 6% (13/222) were supported with artificial ventilation, compared to 12% (189/222) overall. The number of reported SARI cases peaked in the month of February (29%; 466/1624), of which 49% (227/466) tested positive for influenza (Table 2). Although influenza A predominated earlier in the year, by March, influenza B was more common (present in 9% [15/171] of patients, versus 6% [11/171] of those with A/H1pdm09 and 2% [3/171] of those with A/H3). The most commonly identified pathogen in SARI patients was RSV in March (31%, 37/86) through May (24%, 6/25) and rhinovirus in June (28%, 13/46) through November (30%, 26/ 88). By December, influenza A/H3 was the most commonly identified pathogen, present in 30% (75/250) of patients.Patients with no identifiable pathogen, e.g. who were not positive for influenza or any of the pathogens in the multiplex test, were relatively common in the summer and early fall, comprising the majority of patients in August (69%, 11/16) and September (52%, 15/29).",
